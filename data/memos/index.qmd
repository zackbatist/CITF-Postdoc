**Journals** are reflections on my work as it progresses, a place to document my hesitations, anticipations, hopes and worries.

**Field notes** comprise noted observations of participants' behaviours and elicitations.

**Memos** are where observations coalesce into more concrete ideas, where complex ideas take root.

**Jottings** are random scraps, which may be trivial or grand but not necessarily good or related to the research.
