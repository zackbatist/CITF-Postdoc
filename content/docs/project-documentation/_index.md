# Project Documentation
Here you will find a series of preparatory protocols I rely on to structure the work.

## Research Protocol
Outlines the overall project's vision. It contextualizes the project in relation to specific objectives and outlines a broad-level work plan.

## Ethics Protocol
Specifies ethical considerations, including risks of harm and mitigation strategies.

## Interview Protocol
An overview of the questions I will be asking research participants.

## Coding Protocol
Outlines the analytical objectives and coding strategy implemented to achieve them.
