# CITF Postdoc
This website serves as a hub for my postdoctoral research at McGill University's Covid-19 Immunity Task Force Databank.

The project is concerned with articulating social, collaborative and discursive aspects of epidemiological data-sharing initiatives, and how they relate to, overlap with or conflict with technical, institutional and epistemic factors.
