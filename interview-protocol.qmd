## Interview conditions
Interviews may be held either in-person or through online video conference.
All interviews will be held in quiet and comfortable environments, such as office spaces or conference rooms.

## Interview records
I will record all in-person interviews using a SONY ICD-UX560 audio recorder to capture audio in the lossless 16 bit 44.1 kHz Linear PCM wav format, with additional audio filters to enhance playback during transcription, if necessary.

I will also record in-person interview sessions using a GoPro Hero 4 Silver action camera, depending on participants willingness to be video recorded.
Based on prior interviews with scientists about their research experiences, I found that interviewees like to show me, rather than merely tell me, about what they are working on and the means through which they engage with information systems.
The camera may be leveraged to record spontaneous video records of these demonstrations and provide me with an additional rich data source for further analysis.
Moreover, the camera provides an additional backup audio recording in case of data loss on the primary recording device.

Remote interviews will be recorded using the video conferencing software's built-in recording tools.
Participants will be instructed to disable their microphones or video cameras prior to initiating recording if they have opted to not be recorded through these media.
The researcher will record all media locally and refrain from using any cloud services to store or modify the records which the video conference software may provide.

I will also record handwritten notes comprising descriptive accounts of activities and interactions when recording devices are switched off, as well as preliminary interpretations of observed behaviours and notes on things I plan to follow up on at a later time.

## Interview guide
Interviews are oriented by my goal to document values and attitudes concerning data harmonization efforts, as elicited by research participants in their responses.
Participants will be asked to reflect on:

- the motivations for their initiatives;
- the challenges they experience;
- how they envision success and failure;
- their perceptions of their own roles and the roles of other team members and stakeholders;
- the values that inform their decisions;
- how the technological apparatus they set up enables them to realize their goals and values; and
- ways in which they believe data-sharing could be improved.

To this end, each interview will proceed following a strategic order:

### 1. Participants' goals and perspectives
Follow a life-history method to better understand participants' professional backgrounds and their roles within their projects.
The goal is to obtain information about their paths, not the rehearsed origin story.

- To start, can you please tell me a little bit about your background?
- What is the project, and what is your role?
- How did you find yourself in this role?
- How has your previous experience prepared you for your role?

### 2. Projects' missions, purposes, motivations
This section is about the project in general, including its purpose, scope and value.
Information about practices and procedures will be sought in a subsequent phase of the interview.

- What are the project's goals?
- What makes the project unique?
- What is the project doing that no other similar project is doing?
- Do you consider this project as similar to any other initiatives?
- What are they, and in what ways are they simiar or different?

[]()

- What are the expected outcomes?
- Have you achieved these goals and outcomes?
- If not Are you on track to achieving them?
- What are some challenges that the project experienced, and how have you worked to overcome them?

**Prompts:**

- What happened next?
- Who was that person?
- Tell me more about that development or event.


### 3. Practices, procedures, relationships
This section asks about specific actions and interactions that the participant engages in.

#### Roles and relationships

- What does your role entail?
- Can you provide a couple examples of things that you recently did in this capacity?

[]()

- Who else do you frequently rely on, and what are their roles?
- Can you describe what they do, and perhaps give a few examples drawn from their recent work?

**Prompts:**

- Please give me an example.
- Do you remember a specific time when you did this?

The interview might proceed in different ways depending on their initial responses.

#### Maintaining the project community
**For those in charge of recruiting new partners and maintaining community support:**

- Please briefly describe the process through which you obtain new partners or users.
- Can you please recall a recent example?

[]()

- How well do you know each partner?
- Did you know them before their involvement?

[]()

- Would you describe the project as a tight knit community, or more open-ended?

[]()

- How do you communicate with partners and contributors?
- What kinds of media or platforms do you use, and are they targeted for specific purposes? i.e. email, newsletters, social media, skype, personal communication at conferences

[]()

- Are there particular people in each project who you communicate with more frequently than others?
- Who are they, and why are these the people who you connect with?

[]()

- What do you consider your role or responsibility vis-a-vis the development/growth of this community?
- How do you foster the community's development and growth?
- Do you consider these efforts to be effective?

#### Curating data
**For those who actually handle the data in a preparatory or curatorial manner:**

#### Using the data
**For those who actually use the data:**


### Tangential probes
Certain lines of inquiry may cut across different phases of the interview.
Here I articulate some probing questions that touch on these factors.

#### Technical infrastructures

#### Administrative apparatus

#### Relationships with Maelstrom
