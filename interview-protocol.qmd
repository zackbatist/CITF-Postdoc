title: Interview Protocol

In person and online

I will record all interviews using a SONY ICD-UX560 audio recorder to capture audio in the lossless 16 bit 44.1 kHz Linear PCM wav format, with additional audio filters to enhance playback during transcription, if necessary.
I will also record interview sessions using a GoPro Hero 4 Silver action camera, pending interviewees' informed consent.
Based on prior interviews with scientists about their research experiences, I found that interviewees like to show me, rather than merely tell me, about what they are working on and the means through which they engage with information systems.
The action cameras may be leveraged to record spontaneous video records of these demonstrations and provide me with an additional rich data source for further analysis.
Moreover, the action cameras provide an additional backup audio recording in case of data loss on the primary recording device.


I will also record handwritten notes comprising descriptive accounts of activities and interactions when recording devices are switched off, as well as preliminary interpretations of observed behaviours and notes on things I plan to follow up on at a later time.
