description: Notes about a discussion between Tanya, Sadun and myself about data sharing, documantation, and reconciliating different needs and perspectives.
---

These notes are from the CITF weekly update meeting and a brief discussion that followed.
In the meeting, David asked Sadun to present a top-level account of the database and any complications or challenges that he has to deal with.
According to David, they've been so focused on the details for so long, and he thinks it's necessary to take a step back and review where things are at on a broader scale.
This will be at one of our weekly updates, but David also wants to get together with Sadun and Annabelle to initiate a deeper dialogue between them.
I never met Annabelle, but David and Tanya referred to her as someone who is pulling and analyzing data from across the databank, and who will have a distinct perspective from the rest of us.`
In some ways, her role is similar to how I imagine Tina at Maelstrom.
I requested to be present as an observer, and David seemed ok with that.

<pre>
- Us as users who are really close to the work, and who also administer the work
- People we give data to, looking through their eyes, trying to understand how useful the data we give them is, and how much "hand-holding" is required

There was also some reference to "extracts", which I tentatively understand to mean the components that are very tightly integrated which may be put to analytical use.

David mentioned that the incoming UNC data access request could be an opportunity to better understand users' needs.
I didn't say it out loud in this meeting (maybe during tomorrow's biweekly update with David) but I would love to sit in on those conversations too.

---

After David ended the call, and after briefly chatting with Aklil about our focus group project, I joined a really fascinating discussion with Tanya and Sadun.
It stemmed from topics we discussed during the meeting, namely about missing data and how to document these things for people who want to reuse them.
But it also included discussion about some challenges of working with Maelstrom, with people who use the data, with the people who shared data from the original studies.
The conversation had a very casual tone, and I wish I was able to record it.
Midway through I told them that I wanted to take notes on the discussion from my memory of it, and I lamented about not obtaining informed consent.
Tanya indicated her hesitancy on the basis of not especting this to be recorded or used in any way, so I offered to share my initial draft notes for them to review before incorporating into my dataset.

These notes should not be treated as verbatim records.
I tried to remember as much as I could, and despite my best efforts to be as descriptive as possible, notes may appear out of order and include some personal thoughts and interjections.
I also removed some of my own thoughts when I sent the draft for Tanya and Sadun to review since I did not want them to be influenced by my own thoughts that occurred after the conversation ended.

---

I entered the conversation as Tanya and Sadun were talking about how to handle the missing values.
I intervened because I'm genuinely interested in these things and I thought I could lend some support, but also because I saw an opportunuty to gain some insight with regards to my postdoc research.

They referred to the harmonized dataset as if it were one thing, and when I asked about this Tanya clarified what she meant by this.
We used the example of harmonizing variables relating to sex, gender, sex assigned at birth, etc.
I will fill in the details later, and in some ways that was less relevant to the overall scope of the conversation.
But one aspect of this moment that I did find really interesting (and which was repeated at some point later on) is Tanya saying that their work is more like relating recorded variables than consolidating study design criteria.
I think there may be more to unpack here, and somehow it aligns with the prospective / retrospective dichotomy raised by Isabel.
Something to latch on to later.

This transitioned to addressing how missing data are documented and how the harmonized overlaps are reported.
Tanya showed us [the broad table of harmonized variables](https://portal.citf.mcgill.ca/dataset/citf-bl-demographics-hp), which indicate percentages of harmonized variables by study and percentages of harmonized studies by variable.
Tanya expressed some concern that those percentages misrepresent how much was actually harmonized, and she cited an example of transport across provinces, but I was really unfamiliar with it and it was a really brief mention.
It was a notable example because it was a rare (?) example of _under_estimation of harmonization potential, whereas in most conversations I've had about this kind of thing the topic has largely focused on flagging _over_confidence in datasets' combined analytical potential.
I asked about what they want to do to resolve this, and Tanya's response was to maybe put a notice on the page (she didn't use the term, but in my mind I was thinking "disclaimer"), which would draw attention to the tendency for this table to simplify the analytic potential.
This was met with the caveat that they do not want to discourage reuse of the data by those who may not want to consult, or by reducing confidence in the data.
She added that she wants to encourage users to get in touch so that Tanya, Sadun and others who are more familiar with the data could consult with users regarding the nuanced reality of the data's completeness (as I'm writing this, I realize that Tanya was frequently using the term "missingness", which is an interesting inversion of the more common "completeness").
I then suggested that they could break down the rows (representing recorded variables) into topical or thematic groupings, and determine percentages for each of those, and they were both receptive to that idea.

When I commented on how this could be a quick fix, Tanya pointed out that while the CITF hosts the table, Maelstrom is really responsible for updating it.
The conversation then shifted to their relationship with Maelstrom.
Tanya said something really poignant, and I tried to capture it as accurately as possible but was unable to keep track at the end:

&gt; Asking Maelstrom to do more makes us less agile.
&gt; They take a very conservative approach, [whereas us as epidemiolgist come at it with more practical mindset that may require greater flexibility].

At a certian point, not sure if it was at this moment or later, Tanya said something like "they [Maelstrom] have to took at feasibility, make recommendations, do a few cycles of review of the protocol, etc", which implies its more of a bureaucratic process, a series of checks and balances, a series of procedures.
Whereas David just wants to do the work, make it go.
I'm also recalling another reference to their consultations with Maelstrom (I forget if it was before of after this point in time) that when they meet with Maelstrom, they always manage to make a strong and convincing case to be more conservative, to be more considered in their approach.
Something in the way Tanya described it made it seem like an illusion, like they entered this new environment (the meeting with Maelstrom staff) and had a spell cast on them, or were reminded of the "proper" way to do things.
And this really contrasts with our weekly meetings, where David encourages us to just go, produce something, talk things through casually, make it work in practical reality.

Jumping forward and skipping in time to a later part of the discussion that is particularly relevant here.
Tanya told us that she was never involved in data collection.
She had used others' data, and admitted (it felt a bit like an admission, even if it was just a guilt-neutral recollection) that she didn't really think about how the data were being collected.
She mentioned how physicians or those collecting data in clinical contexts would write down what they saw as relevant in the moment, and didn't necessarily think about (or _have_ to think about) what was to be done with the data.
I related my experience with [DObsiSS](https://zackbatist.info/DObsiSS/) and how I had to put blinders on to simply get analytical results out of the project.
Skipping even further ahead, to when we were standing to leave the meeting, Tanya said in the most eloquent way (I really wish I was recording everything, but especially this bit) about how people in labs (she referenced lab people specifically) are filling in their spreadsheets, with little concern for how the data would be used.
And this wasn't said with antagonism, it was actually with great empathy, and perhaps with a renewed understanding of the challenges that she learned while working with CITF in relation to her work doing "pure" data analysis for her doctoral research, and perhaps with a bit of envy for their blissful ignorance.

This all relates to the idea that data workers, who are explicitly data workers in identity, tooling, background, community of practice, etc, and especially those who work with an eye toward developing _research infrastructure_, have a more finely fined curatorial lens, since they must constantly think about reconciling differences between inputs and outcomes.
This is also true on a "grander scale" with Maelstrom, who work on a more abstract level, and who cope with these challenges through adherence to procedure.
And I'm sure that from the perspective of the study originators, CITF is very procedural too, perhaps even to a fault, in their minds.
Which again brings me back to the notion that data management is management, and how data sharing infrastructures mask low-scale collaborative experiences using technical and managerial processes and logics.

I chimed in saying that this whole thing is the reason why I'm here.
Sadun then interjected with a poignant statement, which actually reflects something I was thinking about on the bus ride to work today:^[I was thinking about how to present my work in a way that makes it seem like I'm not judging them, in acticipation of my MCHI talk next week.]
that none of this is good or bad, it just is.
We just have to muddle through it.
Our actions are not good or bad either, but they do affect how people will approach the data.
In other words, our actions as infrastructure maintainers are commitments to certain norms, expectations, and activity-pathways.

---

Turning back to an earlier part of the discussion, we were talking about the people who share their data.
Sadun mentioned how the research assistants may change and communicating with them could be really hard because they weren't there when the data were originally collected and are therefore unable to communicate the nuanced aspects of the data that Sadun needs to document.
At one point Tanya also mentioned that Sadun's work fundamentally entails accounting for all the info shared during emails or zoom calls with study originators.
My sense is that this is happening in terms of drawing relations among variables, and adding notes in a column of a spreadsheet about these decisions, but these are not really documented in a formal or digestible way.

So the task that they have in mind now is to more comprehensively document the data so that users can figure out what is available and how to make effective use of them.
I raised the example of API documentation, which not only define the scope of each variable but include instructions for how to access the data, which bear hints of what they may be used for in example code and vignettes.

I asked why they can't just give all the data to the users, and I guess this was a bit of a silly question because they both immediately thought that was a bad idea.
I asked why the users can't just figure out how to use the data on their own, and they said that they want to ensure that users know how to use the data, navigate through it all, and use it in a way that actually reflects the data's capabilities and limitations.^[This really reminded me of the [dataARC](https://www.data-arc.org/) workshop at the CAA2018 conference, which really inspired my research on archaeological data sharing. DataARC is a pan-disciplinary database on the human ecodynamics of iceland, and researchers were very concerned about how to effectively communicate the disciplinary knowledge necessary to make sense of data they contributed, so that they are not misused. What I concluded from this workshop session, in which they solicited feedback (and which no one was able to really provide) is that they really wanted a collaborative relationship, which was in tension with their desire to make their data openly accessible for anyone to use. I'm seeing the exact same tension here at the CITF.]

I joked that we should simply put the users in touch with the originators and be done with it, and Tanya remarked that by inviting users to consult with us to gain a better understanding of the dataset they could also maybe loop in the studies' originators.
I also remember that in this remark, Tanya used the term "service" to refer to this consultation, which in my mind (thinking about the logic of management) framed this as something that can be made into a standardized procedure.

At some point Tanya mentioned how there are sill so many studies left to ingest, and we started talking about how that works.
Many studies have signed data sharing agreements, and among them, some have given some data and many have not yet provided any at all.
Tanya said that some studies are adamant about getting as many publications as they can before they share the data.
I responded by asking about whether this means the data were properly processed because of the work that they had put in prior to analysis, and she shrugged, not wanting to generalize.

Then she went on to talk about a few different kinds of situations in which data sharing might occur (the prior example being a situation in which data sharing does not occur).
She said that some people are very into it, and will put a lot of effort to document their work.
Others are more reluctant, or do it to clear the task off their list and move on.
I suggested that maybe these latter participants would be less likely to respond to follow up emails, and without saying anything I recall Sadun gave a knowing grin in response to that remark.
But then Tanya also recalled a specific situation where a PI was entirely non-responsive via email, but when they finally got around to meeting on a zoom call he was very thorough in his descriptions of the data and how they should be used.
The point of this was to say that professors are just really busy and get so many emails all the time, so you can't really read too much into it.

So, I'm not doing those types of projects anymore. Um, it's been almost two years since I, uh, finished my PhD.

So, this makes it very easy with collaboration that we have that are way smaller. Uh, CARTaGENE is also, uh, the Quebec representative of the, uh, in the CanPath consortium that you probably already know about, right? Um, so I'm still, uh, a bit involved with harmonization, but it's, uh, prospective harmonization mainly. Um, and it's not something that is really going strong currently, I would say. So...

<pre>Um, so we're still discussing about harmonizing some things, but it's not, um, the effort put in there at this point is not as it was, I guess, in the beginning of the project or as I, uh, did in, let's say, HeLTI project that I managed when I was in Maelstrom. It was prospective harmonization as well. But it was way more, um, hands-on, let's say. And in CanPath, uh, there's also retrospective harmonization, obviously Maelstrom is doing, uh, is doing the work. Um, yeah, so that's that. Um. Other impact of my past experience. Yeah. So, in CARTaGENE, we're currently developing, uh, our online catalog.

<pre>For cataloguing, because then that's what we're discussing right now. Um, I think, um, maybe trusting them that they would find the correct answer to take the right decisions, do the work, like, that was required, even though it was not in the order I wanted them to do at the time, I wanted them to do it. Um, yeah, that's just very far back. So I don't remember all the detail, because we're discussing, like, 2016 at that point. (...) Um... (..) But, yeah, I was, uh, I thought that I had the responsibility of everything, that if, if anything went wrong, it was my fault, that I had, like, all the burden of debt on me, so I was very controlling. Um, so, yeah, that's, uh, not the best part of me, but, uh, yeah, at the time it was what happened.

<pre>And in time with other projects, I met other people as well that earned my trust, and then it was easier to just say, oh, we need to do that for the project. You do this, I do that, we talk again, and then, yeah, we can exchange, and I'll build points, like, some things that I want to change, and then they go and do it. And it was more, um, I was less micromanaging, I guess. But that was my big issue, I think, as a project manager, not a project manager, but team manager at the time. Um, and I, well, again, maybe too honest, but I also recruited people, um, at the time that I thought would not, uh, make any problem for me, which is, uh, (..) because before that, it was, there was a very difficult, um, period in Maelstrom where things were a bit toxic, in my opinion. Um, so when I got in charge, I was very much not into that, and I wanted people who would be just doing their work, following what I say, not fighting, and not being, like, difficult. Uh, which means that I recruited people that, maybe the, the other side of this, is that I had a bit less ambition, autonomy. Uh, they were very people that I could say, do that, they do it, and that's it. They will not fight about things. So that's also something that I've learned through time, um, that I've changed quite a bit.

Um, and then she got me that project, and then ReACH got, was my next one. When Rachel left, I got ReACH as well. Um, yeah. And then I guess I was good enough as a project manager, because when other people left, at some point, I, it was not that good, but I, I got all of the projects. I was managing, like, eight different projects, and, like, most of the three different teams, like cataloguing, harmonization and, uh, IT development. Uh, it was, um, a transition period. So I got a lot of those, and then it got, um, shared with other people afterwards. Um, and then, uh, I didn't want to do as much of the, uh, cataloguing. (..) So, they tried to recruit people to take the catalog, uh, lead. (..) Uh, we tried also internally with some people that were there. It didn't really work. People coming, they didn't stay. So I continued a bit longer than what I wished for. Um, but then it got, um, it got mostly removed from my hands, I guess. I got, I remained involved until I started my PhD, I would say. Uh, at that point, I was still doing project management, ReACH and HeLTI being my two main projects. Um, but I did, I stopped doing most of the cataloguing because I didn't have time to do everything.

Was it driven by the goals or was it driven by, like, you didn't want to stick around doing the maelstrom work? Or, I mean, I don't mean to put it so crudely, but, like, was, was it driven by an objective? And when, when Isabelle sort of introduced you, was it driven by the data work or was it driven by the, maybe, the, the, the object, like, sorry, I'm posing this badly.

And then, uh, I started working with, EUCanConnect as well. Um, and I, I thought it was a good fit to do a project that, uh, use my, (.) my expertise, let's say, um, from Maelstrom, right? That I really believed that the reuse of data was a good idea, that the collaborative work was great. So for me, it was quite normal to go that route. Um, and I decided to do a PhD, um, to go back to your, uh, very specific question. Um, two reasons. Uh, I felt that I didn't go to the end of my education, um, that I should finish it in a way. Uh, that's a bit weird to say, but it's like I stopped after my master, uh, degree. And because at that point I was not doing a PhD, I decided not to do a PhD. But a few years later I was like, yeah, okay, I'm ready to go to the end of it. And also I wanted to have more opportunities, right? I felt a bit, um, stuck in a way. Not, like, I got a lot of opportunities in Maelstrom that would not have been given for someone who only got a master, I guess. But it was not enough.

<pre>Yeah. Um, okay. So did I achieve the outcome? As I said, uh, so in my PhD, I had to do three different research projects. Um, two out of the three were different from what I planned originally. I think I saw too big. Um, one of the projects in particular was, um, a bit excessive for a three year PhD. Um, uh, but, uh, I wanted to do it. Then, uh, I, yeah, I realized, no, I not necessarily realized, but it was, uh, other people realized first. And then I realized that, uh, I would not be able to do that in the three years time-frame. Um, the project was to do like a generic, uh, list of variables to be harmonized in different mother and child cohort in the future. So that was a very, very big project that probably would have taken many years and not realistic for a PhD. So that project got, uh, replaced, uh, by like the ReACH cohort profile, um, that was published. Um, and then there was two, um, projects that, um, required that harmonization and multi-cohort, um, participation. Um, which also got way too big. And one of those two got replaced by, um, looking at my research question in the Danish national birth cohort. So one cohort. (..) So, and then the last one happened. Uh, so if you ask me, did I achieve the outcome that I taught at the beginning? No, um, but it's not a problem in a way because it was replaced by something else. And it was fine with me and more realistic. Um, yeah. So the three different projects, I guess, had their own challenge. Uh, but you know, the one core, it's not mainly your interest. So I think I'll just keep over that.

<pre>Um, I think that one was, um, the least challenging one in a way. Uh, the main challenge is that the data, uh, are hosted in, uh, on the Statistics Denmark, uh, server. So you need to have, like, four levels of security to access that remotely. And I could not access the data, um, while I was in Canada. Because I was going back and forth between Montreal and Copenhagen during my PhD. Uh, so that was something that I had to work around. I did all of the analysis while I was in Copenhagen. And then I had someone, uh, running one or two things for me when I was back in Canada. And I asked, can you double check this and this? Um, so my, uh, so someone from the team. Um, so I guess that was the challenge. Um, and all of that happened during the COVID pandemic. So that was a challenge in itself.

<pre>Uh, but yeah, I didn't really fly in spring 2020, let's say. (.) Um, yeah. So, yeah, the, I'm mentioning the pandemic because for sure in the next project, it, I think it slowed some things down. Um, and also for the project, the one core project, there were less people in the office to provide insights on questions that I might have, um, in a more like, uh, spontaneous way, I guess. (.) Um, but yeah, so that one core project, I don't think it was a big issue. And it's also, um, you know, I did the same statistical analysis, ish in both. So it was my first introduction to it. It's easier when you have only one core. And also it was in R. So, because we'll discuss DataShield, I guess. Um, so that was another level. So it was easy to do that one in the, um, fun in the one cohort. Um, other thing, the ReACH cohort profile, um, that work was started before my PhD, but it took a lot of my first year. So we decided to do it as a, one of the PhD paper. Um, I think the main difficulty is that this type of, well, the main difficulty came before the PhD because, uh, building the network with all in this group, describing all of the participating cohorts took a lot of time and resources, obviously. Um, yeah. (..) So it took like, I don't know, five years to get all of the information to be able to write that one cohort profile.

<pre>Um, yeah. So going back to the story, uh, I contacted them. Five said yes. Um, and then I had to start the process of, uh, requesting data. Right. And that was very different from the two, uh, source of, not source, but kind of source of, of cohorts. So from Canadian cohorts, um, it was more difficult for the data access because, um, I had to go through the access process of each cohort individually. The process is different for each one. Um, so you need to figure that out. And, um, you do the process three times, different process. And then, um, there's a lot of steps in those, uh, process to, uh, between the time you start and the, you get the data. So for me, it took about two years between the first conversation and me getting the data. data. As I said, it was from fall 2019 to, uh, late summer 2021. So pandemic happened. Right. So everything was slowed down. Um, however, it's not unexpected to wait like a year for data. Two years is a bit excessive, but a year could happen.

  <div class="corpus-text">
<pre>Really different. Um, two reasons. Uh, first there were some already harmonized data through LifeCycle and also the, in the LifeCycle initiative, they already agreed to have the requests done centrally. So you would only apply once, uh, seeing which cohort you want access to and only, um, one evaluation, one agreement. So it was way easier. And the process was like just one application. It was reviewed. They say, yes, that's it. Um, to put that in place, I guess took a lot of work, but I was lucky that at the time that I arrived there and doing my project, it was already streamlined and working very well.

<div class="corpus-row uncoded-row" data-speaker="Julie">
  <div class="corpus-speaker">
    <span class="speaker-label">Julie</span>
  </div>
  <div class="corpus-text">
<pre>Um, well, one big difference is that in LifeCycle, no data would be transferred centrally. So they remain on the cohort server, right? Um, so since there were no data transfer, I guess it's easier to agree. Uh, but also I think it's in the idea of LifeCycle that their cohort will be used for LifeCycle projects that are not transferred, but, um, they would allow people to do federated analysis with their data. They would participate in doing harmonization on their data and making them available. So I think it was in the minding of the project. While ReACH, it was a lot about documentation, but there was not that idea to have a organized central, uh, agreement or there were no like federated, uh, the federated analysis infrastructure was not in place in Canada. Uh, the aim of ReACH was different. So, yeah, I think that was the main difference. And for the data, obviously the, uh, Canadian cohorts were the third, three Canadian cohorts, their data were transferred on the, uh, on one server at Maelstrom. So the process is more complicated because you have to have the data transferred versus that in Europe, the data remain on each cohort server. You just have the right to use it.

<pre>So again, it was very different because for the Canadian data, I had access to the individual participant data. Uh, I had a bit of help from the Maelstrom harmonization team. Um, but I did most of the harmonization myself. So the advantage of that is I, um, I took the decisions for the harmonization and I knew I was consistent across a different cohort and I could, uh, validate what I did and also cross validate across cohort. Right. (..) So that's the advantage. The disadvantage is that, um, it was very time consuming. The harmonization work I did for those three cohort took months and months and months. Um, there was the issue that I'll use the, uh, R package that is developed by Maelstrom for to support that harmonization.

So you try, you try, you try and yeah. Now I think it's, it's, it's good, but we're discussing like 2021, end of 2020 and 2021. So, um, yeah, things were rough. Um, but yeah, so yeah, mostly 2020, but yeah. Um, yeah. So, uh, so that's the harmonization for the Canadian. For the European cohort, I don't have access to individual participant data. So there was some variables that were already harmonized through LifeCycle. For example, like basic things like education, uh different access to demographic characteristic, lifestyle, um I had like the gestational age at birth which was my outcome already there and labelled. However the stress and anxiety measures were not harmonized through LifeCycle, so I had to manage that with a representative of my two participating cohorts in, uh, Europe. Because I don't access their data. So I needed to, um, give them the harmonization rules, how I wanted the, uh, score to be created and have them do the work. Right.

Um, and also like many people were using that infrastructure and some, since some servers were not kept up to date appropriately, um, they crash.

Uh, most of my colleagues working at the University of Copenhagen, we had the same person, uh, as a reference. And Dimitri was awesome. Uh, he helped me so much with DataShield.

<pre>I think I was very vocal about the difficulty, both of DataShield, but also the infrastructure. Um, so people know, hopefully, they, they do some, they did something with that. I was not the only one discussing those issues. Like, I'm not special. I had the same experience as many of my colleagues. And I think one way that they did improve was to pair people with someone who knows DataShield very well and that could support you in your project, right?

<pre>Yes. (.) It's, uh, again, it's not exactly simple. You need to open connection to many server and then, like, put them together in a way. And then you run your code and it goes like that. Um, so, uh, it's possible as you would do in R, like, on a server calling things from Opal. It's just that it's, the connection is a bit different. So again, it's DataShield specific and you have, like, restrictions that are not the same, like, as in, um, just what you would use in R. like, you cannot pull the data through your, R environment. You just connect. You have, and then there's built-in, like, restriction from, for, uh, if you have too low numbers for your results, you cannot see it. Uh, because it becomes identifying or things like that.

<pre>All right. And yeah, so just to kind of reiterate, the scope of the interview will focus on your role in the CITF, some challenges you may have experienced in your day-to-day work, the practical solutions that you devised to resolve some of these challenges, and collaboration with other members of the team. And I may also touch on bigger picture challenges, or how things change over time, and your perspective on the CITF's overall direction, or the CITF data bank. I might use those terms interchangeably.</pre>

<pre>Yeah. Actually, if we're done, I should be looking at this, I guess. Anyway, just to start, can you tell me in your own words, what is the CITF, or the CITF data bank, and what is your role in it? (..)</pre>

  <div class="corpus-text">
<pre>Well, I started out as the data manager for the CITF when it was still under the secretariat. And so really in the early stages of planning for data sharing, so when they were still in the phase of funding studies, I was involved in helping to create questionnaires and stuff. I had some input on things that would hopefully make data sharing and data harmonization easier once that started. And then slowly toward the end of the life of the secretariat in, I guess, fall of 2023, studies actually started to have data to share. And then so although the data bank or database was always kind of talked about in vague terms since the beginning of the CITF secretariat, by fall 2023, the data bank was becoming more defined, and they knew that the secretariat was going to come to an end, but that the data bank would be a legacy project from that. And then so when the secretariat ended in March 2024, we officially became the CITF data bank, which was a different structure, right? It became a research project under David. So my role changed slightly over the course of those years from, you know, just from more of an HR point of view. It was more of like a management track switched over to a research associate role because that offered more flexibility. And that's also something that can be covered under a research grant as opposed to a big, you know, the big secretariat that had other funding for all sorts of infrastructure. (...) So my role is sort of changed and evolved over time, and I kind of fill in where necessary. So I guess I'm a research associate, and I don't have a very well-defined role right now, but I'm kind of, I'm definitely, other than David, the person on the team that has that early, that sort of continuity over it. So I'd say that's maybe kind of, one of my roles is that institutional memory or whatever.</pre>

<pre>So I, I'm involved in coordinating, I think, a lot of the work or training the work that, training the other research assistants on the team who have joined relatively recently. Um, so I, I sort of fill in where needed and try to coordinate the activities from data intake and, um, uh, the, the coordination with the, um, harmonization, uh, team at Maelstrom and also trying to think about potential research projects that we can do. And we have the, the, um, um, public health, um, students doing their practicum, uh, now. So I'm sort of involved in the research projects that they're doing and, um, helping, um, one of my coworkers take on more and more of the data access office, like running the data access office and working on promoting the data bank, um, to researchers. So I'm really sort of, um, um, just doing a lot of delegating and coordinating, uh, of meetings and, and trying to think strategically a little bit, um, since, uh, since David is, you know, a little, uh, not as, uh, available for the day to day. So it's sort of that, that bridging between, um, the big strategy and translating that to some of the more day to day work. Um, so, uh, more practically speaking, it means, um, I'm not sure to what extent I should mention names.</pre>

<pre>I'm sure there are, it's a bit of a unicorn role, but, I mean, it sounds very reasonable on paper, but when you really start to look into it, it's like, of course, a certain amount of expertise in a lot of different things. (.) So, so, uh, with David's help and, uh, Olivia, um, and, uh, we had a great contracts officer. We just kind of worked things out, and I was the, sort of, day-to-day kind of coordinator of that. Um, and I slowly started to understand more about the, um, about data governance, which I really didn't know very much about other than our basic training that we get from the, having to do the Tri-Council, um, stuff. And basic, I think, common sense with data, having worked a little bit with, um, provincial, you know, big surveys and the regulations there. And, um, I think what I was mainly bringing was my experience, my epi experience in measurement. So an appreciation for, uh, needing really well-defined variables and, and how, you know, the, the potential pitfalls of, of how you collect different typical, like, epi information, um, both more on the social side and, and, like, biomarkers and stuff, which I had experience with. And so, so that's where, I guess, I had a little bit more immediate input or, like, a little bit more, um, uh, independence in. And the other stuff, um, I just got trained on the job by, you know, the data governance aspect and contracts and stuff like that, yeah.</pre>

<pre>Um, yeah, understanding, something that I struggled with a lot was, um, (..) understanding, uh, data sharing contracts, um, terminology, and, and contracts terminology in general. Like, I, I found, uh, uh, so luckily I never had to actually become the person that was working out the details on a contract. I was just, like, a facilitator between contracts officers at different institutions. Um, and, but definitely, like, sometimes if I found the language confusing or, or I was concerned that maybe, um, uh, potential data sharing scenario had not been covered in a, in, in some contract, I was able to ask, uh, David or the, our, our contracts officer that was dedicated to the, you know, the, um, to the CITF, um, whether this covered certain situations and, you know, um, if more detail was required or, like, what did this mean? And so it was interesting to learn about, like, who, who actually has the authority to enter into these kinds of contracts, and it was interesting to see that, like, although it is contracts, it's, still comes down to, I guess, professional roles a lot, or, like, what, what is implied if someone is a professor, if someone, like, um.</pre>

<pre>Um, so with experience, I could imagine what a certain section of the data governance framework (.) should look like or how, how, you know, some of the, the, the, you know, what I understood from it could be, would be operational or operationalized. And then I was able to say, okay, does this language actually cover that? Or yes, maybe it covers it, but we should, you know, can we go into a bit more detail to make, to make, to make, you know, the people that need to use this, this document, um, have a little, you know, make it easier for them to read and also have a little bit more concrete, (....) um, procedures. I mean, it's not a procedural document, but, you know, have, have some, uh, a little more concrete idea of, of what this fairly legal, conceptual language actually means, uh, uh, in your day-to-day work or, or, you know, actually preparing a data file to, to share with the CITF or vice versa. Um, yeah, there was, there's a lot of, a lot of, I think, legal language that, yeah, technically covers data sharing, but doesn't always really give a clear idea of what, how one would actually do it. Yeah. There's a lot of, um, assumption about, a lot of assumptions about, I think, like, well, or that, that maybe the assumption is that that it's kind of obvious, or, I don't know.</pre>

Um, you mean during your PhD before, before the, before my master's, my, and, and there's a certain amount of derived variables that, you know, from the original variables as they were collected. Um, so really it was, it was, it was very different. I, I had, I had a little bit of involvement in creating, um, a questionnaire, um, in the past, but only a bit at the beginning, and then someone else, um, went on with it. So, uh, so, yeah, it was really new to me to be at the, uh, front end, like suggesting, um, um, helping create data collection instruments. And even then, we weren't creating, uh, an actual data collection instrument. We were giving a, um, you know, suggested questionnaire and, and, um, and laboratory results, uh, templates. So, um, so it was more the, my experience, uh, using different data sets in the past, um, and problems that we might have come up against when, you know, we try to use collected data data and, um, for, for a very, you know, specific, well-defined construct, you know, um, further down the, the road. Um, so, so it was very different in that sense. And really, uh, the overlap was more just in the, the con, like in the, in the con, at the conceptual level, yeah, rather than the actual hands-on work. (.)</pre>

<pre>And some of the, um, some of the terminology that they used or the, the, the way they enumerated the different activities, um, didn't make total sense in, in terms of the way we actually, how run things. Um, and so we started to redefine that and we've just been trying to, uh, make that more and more well-defined. And I don't have a background in project management and, um, I think spent a lot of time over the last few years trying to fit processes in, or like regular operations into a project framework. And, um, and so I think, yeah, there's been an evolution in the, in the ways or how, how do we, uh, track our activities if we ever wanted to, uh, look back as sort of a check of, well, okay, how, you know, what is the, what is the basis for this activity that we're doing? Um, how long did it take to do these things? You know, it was sort of typical, um, a typical cycle or like, you know, doing this process for a study versus doing it for the 60 studies, um, kind of just tracking all of that versus things that were more like one-time kind of, uh, one-time projects.</pre>

Um, and we are by no means their top priority, you know, like, uh, it's not just that they're doing it at a goodwill, but because it was sort of a tacit, I don't know, it was, you know, a great kind of, um, tacit agreements or sort of part of some of our funding all goes to university administrative offices and stuff, right? So, um, but, uh, so it's sending people reminders without having the much leverage, um, so, uh, and then keeping track of when it's time to remind people and ask for people, ask for things again, uh, ask for clarification.

You know, some of the tricky demographic variables, like ethnicity, and, um, whether someone is living in an institution, you know, when, and, uh, whether a questionnaire was by proxy, or was a questionnaire even actually administered, or was it done by chart review? There were a lot of things, we, we kind of had this, uh, ideal, or this, this, we, we made assumptions about how the data would be collected, and how often, you know, we never imagined that, or the questionnaires weren't really designed in a way. I'm sure a lot of infectious disease epidemiologists realized that COVID would stretch out for a long time, but some of the early versions of the questionnaire didn't, didn't, or weren't really designed for repeated, um, repeated collection of, of, uh, COVID testing and, um, the, the ongoing vaccination boosters and, and also, and, and like the changing testing, standardization of testing, um, just a lot of, like, variable definition, uh, type questions that have caused problems over time, and when it comes to working with the studies, we want, we want to maximize (...) the harmonization over time, so people that were, that were out in the field early versus later and doing follow-up visits, um, and so only recommending changes to, to the, the questionnaires, um, when absolutely necessary, um, and versus getting, you know, just like a much more specific definition of something, uh, you know, that, that's always a trade, there's always that trade-off there.</pre>

So that's sort of my biggest, um, interpersonal, interprofessional, whatever, um, dynamics. And then in terms of more, like, external people, um, working with study teams has, has, I mean, I don't have as much interaction with them as I would have liked because everyone's so busy. But, um, but, um, but it's been interesting working with them and learning that not everybody has, uh, that much experience with, with, um, epi data, uh, management. And, um, and that I should, you know, take fewer of those, those things for granted. Um, but, but, like, just also, like, the, it should be so nice working with, uh, people too, because the vast majority of them are really, uh, curious and really know their stuff and, uh, and, uh, and Zoom meetings. So in person, but it's almost always on, on, online, um, is, uh, often brings up things and gets to, like, the core of an issue better than an email. Um, and, uh, so whenever there's the opportunity to do that, you know, but a lot happens by email, but really, like, some of the most satisfying breakthroughs have been, like, on a Zoom talking to, uh, someone and then you, like, something, something about that more personal connection (...) prompts a question about what they actually do or how they got the data or, or, or were working with participants or whatever. And, and then it's like, oh, okay, that, that's, uh, then we get a much deeper understanding of, of the problem and, or maybe we'd be kind of, like, circling around a question for a while, you know, trying to get a question, trying to get an answer about, so. Were these, you know, were they proxy respondents or not? And then, but the person doesn't really, isn't familiar with that term. And anyway, so, you know what I mean? Like, it's like, um, talking to people is, uh, interesting and usually people are usually willing to, to explain what they do and, um, and that helps a lot. Um, so that, that's the other kind of, yeah, interaction with people that I, I really enjoy or feel, um, and then, but, and then another person I feel a lot of affinity for and would have liked to have more involved. And we, there is an opportunity to have her more involved, but I don't have, like, a concrete ask, like, I don't have a specific ask, is, um, the data librarian who has, uh, helped us set up the Borealis, um, Dataverse. Um, I can't think of an exact, like, a really good example, but I just feel like she really knows a lot about data and, and it would have been nice to have her involved.</pre>

<pre>Uh, just, just to sort of top it off, because we have our eight minutes left. So, uh, when you were starting out, either as a researcher in general, or specifically as a member of the CITF and CITF data bank, did you place emphasis on certain things that you then realized weren't as important? And are there things that you wish you would emphasize, or are there things that you wish you would emphasize more? (..)</pre>

<pre>Um, for whatever reason, early on, I mean, fairly early on, I guess, in my, during my master's, or maybe work I did after my master's, but definitely before my PhD, I had fairly, I, I was fairly convinced that measurement and, like, well-defined variables was, was very important. And we get taught that, but then I think it kind of goes by the wayside until, uh, well, because it's not super interesting unless, I don't know, unless you sort of like definitions and stuff like that. So, that was something that, um, through, yeah, that, that, that I think I, um, is mentioned early on in the training, and then may or may not get reinforced, um, depending on the data you end up using, or kind of specific research projects you get involved in. And, um, so I'd say in general, like, measurement research and emphasis on being very precise in the definitions often isn't, um, recognized by other researchers that much in the study planning phase, and, and we may more, you know, suffer the consequences of it later when we try to do an analysis or get reviewers' comments. Um, but that only partially answers your question. I'm not sure. (......) All right. (......) Yeah.</pre>

<pre>I think it, I think the contracts officer and us, by extension, would have liked to have some kind of, (..) somehow have more leverage on studies to, you know, give them more incentives, um, or consequences for not data sharing. Um, but really I don't know if that could have happened and, and still got, like, as much research done and people out in the field as they, as quickly as they did. Um, so I, I don't know what could have been changed, but in terms of, um, it's like what I'm working on now, that, that, that metadata and institutional memory, um, it would have been nice to have a little bit more, like, like a software developer or someone on the, like, to, to help us with tools. Um, because, uh, it, it generates so much information about, about the, the, the researchers themselves and the, and the process of, of, um, like, the reason, like coordinating the resources and when they actually get their ethics, you know, the reasons for delays for getting out in the field. Um, you know, the CITF collected all that information about these studies because, because they weren't coordinating it with, you know, they funded it and they supported it, supported them a little bit to the extent they could. But ultimately, all these, these researchers were going out and doing their things in the wild and meeting their usual problems. Um, but the CITF had, I guess, kind of a, like, like an interesting access to the information about the problems of going out there and, and, and, and conducting studies. And then, like, the, the publications that came out of it and, uh, preprints and rapid, like, result sharing and all that. Like, they, they had all this information and I, um, and I don't think there was a really good way to, to collect it, except in a very qualitative way. You know, they wrote, uh, their final report and all that and there was a lot of information in there. But, um, but I think it could have been done in a, in a more structured way that would have been helpful. And so we're trying to do that with the data bank. But I don't think there was a, I, I don't think anybody anticipated that need in part because I think when they started, they thought maybe they were going to fund 15, 20 studies. I don't know if they knew from the beginning that they were going to end up funding 100 studies.</pre>

<pre>Alright, so, just to, I want to frame my interest, what this interview, what the scope and interview is going to be about, specifically it's going to be about your role in the CITF and the CITF data bank, some challenges you experience in your day-to-day work, and how you resolve or maybe do not resolve those challenges, factors involved in leading a large and collaborative research project and coordinating the team, and factors involved in engaging in the broader research community. And if there's time, we may also touch on bigger picture challenges with regards to the CITF's mission, and the fields in which the CITF is situated, and how things have changed over time, right? Okay. Okay. So, maybe to start things out, maybe in your own words, can you describe what is the CITF slash the CITF data bank, and what is your role in it? Sure. (.)</pre>

<pre>I guess I'd say past tense for the CITF, because it ceased to exist, I guess, last April, or last March, whereas the data bank lives on. So, the CITF COVID-19 Community Task Force was a task force of experts that was set up at the request of the federal government to advance knowledge about immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in the context of the pandemic. And then the data bank was kind of a piece or a portion of the secretariat that was put in place to support that task force in their work, primarily with the goal of facilitating data management, data governance, with an eye towards allowing the data to be shared or reused beyond their original scientific intent.</pre>

<pre>Oh, well, it's changed quite a bit over the course. I mean, early on, it was very much taking a very short mandate, really, with some guiding principles and turning it into a plan. So that was the first role. (.) So really building out the vision for what we were going to do in terms of the mandate around data sharing and building out, you know, the kind of governance around that and then building a team and building the infrastructure. (...) So that was early on, it was really about the vision and the framing it and then quickly putting in place all sorts of policies and procedures too. (...) And a lot of interaction with members of the task force too in those earlier points. I mean, mainly around putting in place things like consent elements, core data elements, like a lot of that involved going back and forth with different parts of the task force. (.) You know, the Indigenous advisory circle, while it still existed, was engaged around a lot of the stuff that we did. So it was like this pediatric network around the questions, so were other groups. (.) So that was fairly involved early on. And then a lot of reaching out to individual studies and trying to do that either in a group way where we would broadcast out through webinars and meetings and or one-on-one follow-ups. So building out a team that could direct that. So I think about it often as sort of like a, this is my more technical background, but you know, kind of the data coming in, what we do with it, how we analyze it and data going out. And so we really had to build the process and procedures for ins, what we did inside here and then what went out.</pre>

<pre>So the, the origins of it were, uh, I think it was a direct conversation with Tim, um, in the pandemic, early in the pandemic. Um, you know, I kind of became aware that he was building this, the, or helping to build up the secretariat and the overall task force. (..) And I can't remember, I, I was fairly, a little fuzzy, but I think I may have had a discussion with him before about this when he was planning on a different strategy. I think he had a different partner in mind. I think it was, maybe it was Sammy Suissa actually. I think it was, uh, who was going to help with this. Um, but then there was some confusion or issue around funds being transferred because I think that was not, that was the, uh, essentially the Lady Davis Institute at the, the Jewish General and not McGill. And so it was complicated. And I think, uh, for whatever reason, Sammy did not see it as a good fit. And so, uh, that's when I think I had that discussion with Tim and said, well, you know, that's something I could help with. And I agreed to help with it. So, and that kind of made it easier in some sense, cause it's kept it here, um, at McGill. And probably in some sense it may have been a closer fit to my skillset than to what Sammy's was anyway. So it may have worked out to be for the better.</pre>

<pre>Yeah, sure. (.) So, I mean, I see it as, as, you know, sort of largely informatics. Yeah. Uh, in the sense, I mean, there is some analysis that has to happen, but the analysis was that was being done was mainly surveillance analysis, which is also something I have a lot of experience in. So on the informatics side, um, you know, I've not done a lot of work with epidemiologic studies. I mean, I've supported individual or smaller studies, I would say, and some of the work that they do, but certainly thought a lot from, um, you know, surveillance perspective and about the importance of, you know, core data elements when you collect information. Uh, I did actually learn a fair bit about, uh, informed consent and that kind of stuff. I wasn't an expert really in that area, but generally data governance, I have a lot of experience working in that space too. So, you know, understanding the kind of the governance issues and the data management issues, certainly all the infrastructure in terms of data reporting and database management and all that kind of stuff was, was something I have a lot of experience with.</pre>

<pre>Yeah, not really. I mean, I've always been kind of involved in data management and professionally and academically, I would say. So professionally, mainly through my roles in, in hospitals and public health departments where I've kind of focused on, you know, the informatics of, of how data come in, how they structure them, what they do with them. Uh, that was certainly my PhD training and, uh, and in hospitals, the same thing. Yeah. (..) Um, and then I've had a number of, of projects in that space that have kind of built on that, um, in the past. I mean, they, again, they haven't been exactly the same. They've often dealt with more administrative data or data from health records. It's less with, you know, primary collected data through questionnaire and, and that kind of thing. Yeah.</pre>

So it's going to go into depth and then back out. Sure, sure. So I'm going back out to another kind of focus on your duties, tasks, challenges, resolutions kind of thing. So, um, I understand that there, you're involved in a wide variety of tasks, right? Do you tend to classify or characterize these activities in any way?

  <div class="corpus-text">
<pre>Yeah. I mean, just with the caveat that's been kind of changing quite a bit over time, obviously. Right. So, um, I do sort of think about them in chunks. (.) Um, so the biggest chunking was sort of more analysis and data management.</pre>

  <div class="corpus-text">
<pre>And so, you know, we do less analysis right now, mainly because most of the analysis that we were doing was in more of a surveillance mode. Mm. So it was sort of like, you know, what, what have we collected? And mainly with residual bloods. So, but throughout the pandemic, we had a lot of trying to, uh, come up with ways to measure the quality of the data, adjust the data if necessary, based on sampling or, um, assay characteristics. And then fit time series models and other kind of, uh, statistical models to try to infer something about population immunity, uh, and ultimately force an infection and things like that that were a little more distant. And so, you know, that was never, uh, and then of course we had reports going up every, you know, it seemed like every day, it was probably every week or two to, uh, public health officers and stuff like that. Um, and ultimately we ended up writing a paper too on that analysis work that was published. (.) But I guess that would probably be like 20% max it would have been, I would say even at the peak of our work, maybe a little more, but I think most of the, most of the effort went into data management, um, which, you know, has a lot of components to it. I mean, one was the governance piece, which was much more active earlier on, but continued throughout. And so that was really putting in place like an understanding for ourselves and also communication to others about like, what's the legal and ethical framework under which, you know, data can be deposited into the data bank for sharing, uh, and then how would it be shared afterwards kind of thing. So that was the kind of all the governance piece and then the technical infrastructure. So we actually had to, you know, implement all sorts of, uh, and those linked to the governance because the technical infrastructure had to meet certain, you know, requirements to, to be able to hold data, um, and then building the team. So we had, you know, higher people, we were fairly stable actually for most of the pandemic. And then sort of when CITF had its official cease, we had some, some changeover, but, uh, was fairly stable throughout the pandemic. And then a lot of interactions. So I was sort of the face of the data management analysis thing. So I was on a day to day operations. People like Tanya, for example, were very much involved interfacing with the, uh, secretariat, but when it came to meeting with PIs or, or meeting with partners like Statistics Canada for example, the public health agency or whatever, I was often pulled into that too. So, um, that, that ended up taking up a fair bit of time.</pre>

So it was a little bit, but, and I think it took a while for people to understand what we're doing, to be honest, the scope and why, and, and there were many different disciplines involved.

<pre>Well, I mean, the, so we had everybody from more basic scientists through to, you know, clinical epidemiologists, public health people, and pretty much everything in between. Um, my sense was that a lot of the people, certainly all the people that were more involved in analysis work that we were working with, the basic scientists, the lab people, they seem much more understanding about data sharing and quite open to it. And when we got more to the clinical side, people seem to have a bit of a different model where it was more about, I, you know, maybe it goes to the nature of how they collect data and the effort involved and all that. But more of the sense that like, I have a cohort or a group of people that I've recruited and got their data. And it's like, I don't really get why I want it or what the value of sharing is, or, or, or, or they could, they would sort of see more of the negatives for them, I guess, than the positives.</pre>

<pre>Um, effort, I guess. I guess some people complained that, you know, this, this took time on their side, um, which fairly it did, right? Because we had a mixture of studies at different phases. Like we didn't, they didn't all start when we started, some were already rolling. Some started when we started, but either didn't see or chose not to see the consent elements they required to share data. And so, you know, it did then become challenging because if somebody came to us eight months in or 12 months in, and, uh, we were talking about data sharing and then transferring data to us. And then, you know, we would ask about whether they had the required consent elements. They'd say, oh, we don't know. Here's our consent form. We'd look at it. We'd say, no, you know, uh, and then at that point it's, you know, either they don't share the data or they get an REB waiver. They don't need the consent elements or they go back and re-consent everybody. (..) The last two options are not desirable from a perspective, particularly the final one, right? I mean, never a child, never, never a pleasure to go back to your REB and try and get a waiver and to try and go back and re-consent to a bunch of people that's time and money and all that kind of stuff. So, so we had a number of, you know, those sort of situations where, you know, you could never really tell if it was, uh, if it really was missed or if they did on purpose or, you know, whatever. But, and then some people will just complain that they didn't want to share data. I don't quite know. Tim, uh, may have more insights on that because he, uh, some of it was turf too. I mean, some of the blood operators, for example, CBS was quite willing to share, but under certain caveats with us. We never got any data from HEMA Quebec. I think they were quite territorial with their data to some extent. Um, and they just didn't see it as, as, as, you know, they just didn't see a value to them, I guess.</pre>

Clinician from a blood supply perspective, right? That their primary thing is to make sure that they have the necessary blood products to put into the healthcare system. Right. And so what we're doing with them is sort of a bit of an aside in a way. I mean, they do do immunology testing to protect the blood supply, but it's relatively recent. (.)

<pre>So. Yeah. So for them, data sharing is like a source, not like a sink, I guess, you know what I mean? Like they, for the most part, they're, they don't generate data. They work with people that do generate data or they try and find data that someone's generated, they can get access to. (.) So I think particularly in the context of COVID, it was interesting because everybody's living through it. And so for the, a lot of the statistical mathematical folks, it was like, it was a really relevant hot topic that, you know, you could publish on scientifically, but also had some sort of personal relevance. And, you know, there were lots of interesting questions. So getting access to some of these kind of data around immunology, particularly at the individual level, was quite unique.</pre>

<pre>I mean, some, yes. Um, and, but I would say there were partial resolutions for the most part. I mean, it, it was literally in the funding agreement that people would share data, but not everybody did. Um, in some cases it required a lot of pursuit, you know, follow-ups, reminders from multiple levels. Uh, you know, from myself, from staff, from Tim, from, you know, others. Um, that was sort of the approach I think was, and just to be clear, some of the PIs were like totally positive. Like I'm not suggesting it was all negative, but, you know, it was a bit of a tail of the distribution, if you will, that where we kind of had to hound people a little bit, um, and remind them and, and work with them. And, and, and some cases actually work with their REBs as well as them to try and work things out. So, so I think we came up with a kind of strategy there, I guess you might say, to try and bring people and their data closer as, as, as possible from the studies, uh, that we funded. From, like, the residual bloods, most of the provincial labs were quite positive and willing to work with us. Um, it just was a question of what could be shared and what format, you know. And so for them, often it was, they were not sharing individual records. They were sharing seroprevalence estimates that they'd done a certain way. And then the blood operators, uh, CBS, actually quite early on agreed to share with us, uh, almost all the data they were collecting. But they placed limits on what we could do with it. So we weren't allowed to re-share it. So we have all the CBS data, but, but they did work with us to make them accessible to others. So modellers would come and want them formatted a certain way. And so we just had a data sharing room with CBS where we said we would keep them in the loop essentially. And, and, you know, if there was a change in direction or whatever, we would ask them and contact them. Um, and then HEMA Quebec, uh, we never did resolve, uh, that data access issue. There was another one too, um, it was the Biobank in Quebec, the PCQ. Also, we never managed to get any data out of. Uh, and, and it was just, they kind of ran out the clock essentially, I think. Yeah.</pre>

<pre>Yeah. Um, well, you know, there were a lot of different entities, types of entities involved, right? You had like, you know, the big existing national cohorts. You had a PI with a little lab and they were doing a small study. Uh, you know, you had sort of network sometimes the PIs, you have provincial labs, you have blood operators and they were all kind of unique in their own way. I think if I had to go back and think about how I would do things differently, uh, it kind of goes back more to the sort of the raison d'être of what we were doing and like having (.) greater clarity about what type of data we want needed for different purposes and what (....) were the sort of value propositions or rationale for sharing different types of data with different people. (.) And, and, and so the obvious distinction is between like what's more of a surveillance or monitoring mandate and what's more of a knowledge generation creation from sort of, you know, analysis of individual records mandate. (..) You know, we put a lot of effort that most of the data bank is in furtherance of the second one. Well, the assumption that you have a lot of individual records from different studies. You can generate knowledge through scientific inquiry the first time around, but there's actually it's like, you know, I think of it like, you know, olives, you know, you get that first press, the virgin olive oil, you know, that's what everybody wants to publish. But there's a lot of downstream uses. You can do second, third, fourth pressings on those olives, get a lot of stuff out of it. But that's a bit of a hypothesis, I would say, that there's a lot of people that think that's, and there's a lot of, there's some infrastructure that's been built around that. And that's certainly the bulk of the data bank is around that. (..) You know, I'm still a little bit unclear myself on that one. And, you know, that's part of why we're doing this study, I guess, to some extent, is to better characterize that. But that's a big piece of it. And the other piece is really more about, okay, I'm not necessarily trying to generate new knowledge from a traditional study. I'm trying to almost generate information in a surveillance framework. I've got a lot of data coming at me, and I'm trying to make like regular inference about things I care about because they're going to change the way I allocate resources in some sense in the real world on a probably shorter timeframe than these other things will do. And we didn't put nearly as much effort into that, and that generally requires aggregate data, but it requires the done in a very consistent way. (.) And I think if we had clarity, we would have, if it had more clarity ahead of time, I would have got out in front of that process as well with more structure. Because, you know, if you think about what we did for the data bank, there's a lot of structure there that allows us to do exactly what we did in terms of the consent framework, the infrastructure, the sharing process, but all the surveillance stuff, we didn't really have that clarity. And consequently, a lot of the data that we have, like from CBS, we can't re-share it unless we make it, you know, reanalyze it in a way that makes it fully on us.</pre>

<pre>Yeah, definitely, yeah. I mean, most obvious examples, just as Canada. We spent, I don't know how many hours meeting with Statistics Canada. They did two studies for us that we paid them a lot of money for, and neither was terribly useful, but it took so much time. (.) And it was mainly because they were trying to do a probabilistic survey to generate information for surveillance. (....) But they didn't see it that way. They saw themselves as doing a probabilistic survey to generate, like, more insights, like in the first category I described, which is kind of the way they think about it, usually. They're trying to generate inference about associations between things. But, frankly, there wasn't a lot driving, like, what we were trying to ask people, other than, like, exposures and risk habits. So, you know, they ended up having real sampling problems. (.) There were challenges with the technology. They were using dry blood spots, which weren't as predictable or dependable as venous blood draws. And we never got the resolution spatially or temporally that we needed to really do good surveillance with the data. But it was a very...so that's one example. And then when we did get data from them, we didn't in the first study, they wouldn't share data with us. (..) We just spent a lot of time talking about data coverage from the second study, and then it was a huge operation. So we still have this data set. We had to get a whole, like, a whole process of approval for the way we do it. And, like, you know, it was really, really heavy. And, in fact, I think one of the things we should probably destroy that data set very soon, just so we don't have to worry about it. (.) But anyway, I'm obsessing about StatCan. But as you can see, it was a lot of time and effort. So they were probably the most unique, I would say. (.) CBS was a bit different, the Canadian Blood Services, because of the level of data they shared with us and how closely we worked back and forth with them. (....) I think most of the studies we kind of treated in a similar way, the PIs and their groups. Obviously some were a lot easier to work with and engage with. (..) And that's changed over time, probably, as some of them have lost funding and so on, and moved on to other things.</pre>

And so they kind of came in not as, they weren't, I would say, as well developed as like a Canadian cohort, for example, like, you know, like CLSA or something like that. (.) But they'd already worked together to do a number of multicenter studies together. And some of them actually already had data sharing projects. There was another one based in, I think, emergency department data. And so we had big challenges with them because they had pre-existing governance frameworks that were not always compatible with ours. (.) And would require some degree of change to their model to fit with ours, which they were often very reticent to do. Sometimes some of the sites would agree to share data, others wouldn't. So it got kind of messy. So those kind of networks were challenging to work with, I would say. They're probably the hardest ones to work with.</pre>

And when we tried to envelop an existing network of some sort that already had a governance model, then it was hard to make them compatible. It was somewhat similar, too, with the big cohorts like CanPath and CLSA. They both had very strong governance models. The benefit of CLSA and CanPath is the same people that helped us work on our governance model help them. So they were just conceptually aligned. So it was a little easier to share data with CanPath and CLSA than some of these other networks that had really, you know. Like, for example, at the limit, some of them had governance models that just said the data cannot leave the promise. Period. Which is kind of strange because data is fluid, you know. Yeah, but a lot of provinces have a default that their admin data will leave the province. So once you've linked to the admin data, you're kind of...</pre>

<pre>Yeah. I think the flip side of what I saw coming from them more was that they sort of thought they'd worked it out already for them. (.) And here we are coming and saying we want to take all the data that they're already quote unquote sharing, although many of them weren't really sharing it. They were only sharing it amongst themselves with the PIs. And we're trying to reshare it, right? So it kind of also was a bit of a loss of control, I think. Like, you know, I think for individual PIs there was like, you know, well, I'm not, you know, I want to get my juice out of this lemon kind of thing before I give the data on. Some people have that view, but not all of them. (..) But they didn't really have a plan for data, right? Whereas these networks already have a plan for it, like what they're going to do with it, how they're going to, you know, in some cases monetize it or get more scientific value out of it. So I think they almost saw us as competitors or somebody that was trying to assert their authority in that space or even worse, just take their data and they weren't quite sure what we were going to do with it. So I think they saw potential conflicts in that sense. I got a bit of that also from like CLSA and CanPath as well. Like, you know, and it was actually fair questions, you know, because, you know, I don't know about all the networks necessarily. If you look at sort of existing cohorts like CanPath and CLSA, like, I mean, we're going to get a subset of their data and then we're going to put together other data. (.) So, you know, they're kind of, I guess the thinking is, when would it make sense to come to us and when would it make sense to go to them if you wanted to access data? (.) So, I mean, again, I think you come up with good cogent arguments for that. It's just that had to sort of be worked through and we didn't, it was always, it was kind of, it was an N of one thing where you tried to work it through with each entity, right? Like, yeah. But, you know, as we're discussing and I've reflected on this, I think there are different models for different types of entities. If you're going to do this again, where you'd really need to think about this carefully. (..) And of course, the fact that we were using a pooled model, but we made that decision very early on.</pre>

<pre>Well, it was a mix and it wasn't, it was a lot of people doing it, right? It wasn't just me. So, um, I mean the, to, to be frank that the people that gave, ended up sharing data with us for the most part responded to a funding call. (..) Uh, so funding call went out and they applied and if they were awarded it, then sort of the word letter said, okay, now work with me essentially is what it said, you know, to do the data sharing stuff. So it was kind of almost like a, uh, you know, they applied for it, but often didn't know what they were getting into because, you know, when you look at these CIHR things, there's something about data sharing, but you know, you just want the money as a PI. So you apply for the thing. So I think for a lot of them, they kind of, it was figuring out on the fly what that meant. Uh, and some were, some were surprised pleasantly, some less, less pleasantly. Um, but those relationships that were created essentially through a contract, really a funding arrangement. Um, even groups like CBS and StatCan were essentially financial recipients. So they kind of came to talk to us as a function of their funding, basically, uh, somewhat reluctantly for groups like StatCan. They didn't even want to talk about it and didn't share data with us for the first study we funded. Uh, and then they made it a condition of the second one, which, uh, you know, created lots of grief and then didn't add a lot of value, to be honest, in the end, just because of the way that, as I mentioned before, the study they did. Um, and then the blood operators was really, you know, that's where the business was, their residual lab. So, you know, they, we knew that there were a lot of samples. They were already interested in working with people. I think, I guess, did I have relationships with them before? (..) I mean, a little bit, but not a lot. I'd worked with some of the people at CBS and at Hema Quebec. (.) Uh, and I had crossed paths with some of the people in the provincial labs, but it was really probably myself, Bruce Mazer, Tim, (.) that would reach out to those people, uh, if they weren't already kind of part of the group.</pre>

(.) Like, I, I think, so without having a clear sense of that space there, like, I struggle to know what's the right model. I do think this is an exceptionally, like, exceptional model in a sense that's not very common. (.) Uh, except for the NIH example, where you get money and the criteria of that, of you getting the money, is that you have to share the data in a sort of specific way. Uh, and then there, I think people know going up, have a, when they go into it, they know. This is the NIH. Everyone deals with the NIH. Right. And, but, but exactly. And then they, you know, they, they set a policy, a thing, and they have a process for it. And people who do trials, like, they know that's, it's coming. They probably got advance notice coming down the pipe, this is going to happen. Um, if for, in this case, it was very much a kind of, you know, a bit of the chaos of the pandemic, the funding went out, there's something mentioned, but I don't think people fully got it necessarily.

It's a, you know, it's more of a group of investigators are doing something similar in different places and they see a value of trying to bring their data together. (.) Or it's a group of investigators who apply for a multicenter kind of, you know, trial, grant, whatever, and data sharing is a key piece of that.

Uh, you know, I don't, like, I'm just trying to think about examples in biomedical space with the kind of degree of goal openness that our goal was to be able to share data anywhere in the world, any type of entity as long as we're doing research, valid research, and it's real relevant to COVID.

I don't think international bothered a lot of people, but sort of for profit bothered a lot of people. (...) Some, some data sharing agreements explicitly refuse that. So we have some data sets where they've told us that, you know, yes, we'll give you our data, but we can't let you share it to a non-academic institution, which, don't get me started, there's all sorts of ways that that becomes challenging to even define. And then sometimes it's at the individual level. So, in fact, one study we have, I believe at least one, they have an individual consent element was, do you agree to let your data be used for commercial research?

<pre>We've only hired a few people in these roles, but, um, certainly initiative is important, especially earlier on because we were kind of creating something and, you know, you needed people that could kind of see an area and, you know, go with it and have some degree of ownership of it. Like, I think for example, Hannah was very good at that in laying out like, you know, the access process and the documents and keeping tabs on all that, coordinating on the governance work, like, you know, and the same for Ahmed, you know, he built out a lot of that infrastructure for receiving data, the database structure. Uh, and I think actually, you know, that's kind of, kind of worked out pretty well too with the other two folks we have now. Sadun I think is maybe has a bit more expertise or experience with some of the, the data infrastructure. And so I think he's been able to kind of learn what Ahmed's done and, you know, harden it and, and, and create some more value there. Uh, and then Aklil I think is, you know, she's a bit of a different focus. Hannah was more, I would say, uh, analytic and, and computer kind of design oriented. Whereas Aklil is more of a people person, I think, and more qualitative and she's been pushing out to help us, uh, really test our hypotheses about likely users for the data. So, so they both got that initiative, I would say. Um, uh, and flexibility, uh, because it's, you know, it's not one thing that anybody's doing. You, you kind of got to work across a few different areas. And of course I wanted people that could also, uh, be, um, uh, professional because you're interacting a lot with people outside the, you know, our group. You know, like usually an RA, you hire them when they work with a new team. They're not interfacing with PIs at other universities or funding agencies and stuff like that. So it's always been important to have people that are, you know, professional.</pre>

<pre>There was some overlap, but there was also Ahmed had, mainly was through documentation that Ahmed created, which was extensive. Uh, and through Tanya, who was the kind of the continuity, uh, cause you know, she didn't know everything that Ahmed did, but she worked quite closely with him. So I think, uh, that, I think that went pretty well. I think it's, uh, I mean, the, the structure we have and the data we have, it's not horribly complex. So, you know, somebody who's fairly well versed in, in databases and that sort of stuff can come up to speed real well to the quick layers, which Ahmed with, uh, Sadun did. Um, I mean, the stuff that Hannah was doing kind of morphed and changed a bit. (.) Uh, I mean, the pieces that were most relevant for Aklil would really be the data access, which has not been terribly active cause we haven't had tons and tons of requests. Uh, and, and the part she's really pushing on was not something I hadn't done before, that user engagement. I mean, Ahmed and Hannah went to a couple conferences and stood behind a booth and stuff like that, which was not a good way of getting the word out, I don't think. But, but they didn't really engage in the kind of, you know, characterization or, or whatever you would call it, that, um, segmentation work, whatever you want to say that, that, uh, Kiel's like focusing on.</pre>

<pre>Pretty most directly with the team here, I would say. I mean, externally, there's a whole, there's a broader network with which we put in a proposal that we didn't get funded, unfortunately, with CIHR to, uh, the pandemic preparedness competition to build a, uh, federated, uh, serial surveillance network in Canada. So that's a group of people, um, from the blood blanks, residual labs, provincial labs, uh, kind of stuff. So they're not as involved, I would say, in order to the data bank right now. Um, some of them have been more in the past, but, uh, and then in terms of the grant, I mean, it's fun to work with you now. We have a bunch of PIs or co-PIs or co-investigators, I guess. I think on the LAPI. So some have moved on, like Tim, so I don't seem as much. Uh, Bruce Mazer is on our grant, but we've not really got into immunology as much. Uh, Dave Stevens I still interact with a little bit, although we haven't really ramped up the analytics. And then, of course, there's people from the library that we've actually been a bit more involved with since we've started to move in the direction more of, you know, medicine and stuff. So, uh, and then I guess there's also the people we contract with. So, um, which, uh, for the governance was, uh, was through actually, um, part of an office group, but it was mainly Alex Bernier, but, you know, we don't have any direct relationship with him anymore, other than through the, um, data access committee, the chairs. Uh, and then, uh, Maelstrom and Isabel, who's kind of stepping back from a lot of things now. So it's more of Rita and her team, really, that, uh, we still have a contract with them.

So like a CEDAR project at Stanford is one, um, which in fact, they were going to be collaborators with us on that grant we had we were trying to get. Um, that was really more about the sort of informatics methods for core data elements and for harmonization and that kind of stuff. Um, what else would I say? (..) Then there's, I guess, projects that are more generally about kind of sharing COVID data. (.) There was a couple we kind of talked with a bit in, uh, mainly based in Europe. Um, but they seem to be much more focused on hospital like cases as opposed to general population. So there was some, you know, affiliation, but it was not perfect. Um, and then there's more just general repository data sharing kind of things, which I think are kind of interesting, but like, you know, not as relevant as what we're doing. (.)

<pre>For the data bank, um, I don't think it's super unique in a sense. In the sense that I think there are lots of examples of large funding projects that have required some informatics core, one of, one of which, one of that, one of the objectives of which is, is, is actual data sharing and data use. Often it's within the network, though, or within the funded entities. So I think, like, you know, in the US, the NIH has EU mechanisms, you know, for funding a hub or an informatics center that a bunch of other, you know, RO1 funded grants will interact with, you know, like, so.

<pre>Not as much in Canada, actually, I find. Um, mainly because we've under-invested in informatics and we don't really appreciate its value, I think. Um, so in that regard, I think it's kind of similar. I think what's different about it would be the, the context in the middle of, you know, started into a pandemic like that and that it was, as we've already discussed, a bit of a kind of top-down thing. Like it didn't, even with those kind of you model, you know, with the NIH kind of thing, people usually are like, have bought into the value of doing it right from the start. And they see like, you know, it's, it's, so I think, I think the scale, the fact that it was done in Canada is, is somewhat unique. Um, yeah. (.....) And, but from the start too, it's also been a challenge to think about it. It's like, it's life course, which we're kind of coming up against now that, you know, it's like, okay, so I, you know, I still believe there's gonna be great value in all this, but, (..) you know, interest in research and COVID, it's really dropped. I knew it would. Um, and it'll probably come back again at some point in the future, but, you know, (..) with a data bank that does not have, like, it's got a finite coverage essentially, right? Like what's, what's the model for that going forward? Uh, you know, there aren't a lot of examples to look at in that regard. So what's the best way to, to think about, uh, ensuring some ongoing value here? Yeah. That's an unfortunate, as we said, it's, it's, I don't think there's a lot of examples to look to, um, but it's something I've been thinking about.</pre>

It would have solved a lot of problems if we just said right from the start, you know, before you send out a consent form, let, let us look at it and make sure like, you know, we tried to really push that down and delegate that to the PI. And I think it was, it was not the best strategy. Um, so that was one. Uh, the other was that distinction between the types of data and the purposes, you know, the surveillance versus the kind of knowledge generating research. Uh, I think we could have been much clearer about what we were, what we were doing on the kind of monitoring side and what kind of data we wanted, what kind of format, uh, maybe a bit more thoughtful about where we gathered it from, I would say.</pre>

<pre>I'd hope so. But I'm not sure. Like, my sense about the genesis of this whole thing too, is it was very much a personal issue of the right people talking to the right person in the government and making something happen. Would that, you know, magic sauce come together again? I don't know. Um, in the same context, it was very much my, it's very much my sense that it wasn't like that was like a careful look across all the options and they picked this one. It was more like, okay, this seems like an organized team. It's a cogent idea. We got to do something. Let's jump on it. You know, I mean, that was a bit of my sense, the way it played out. Um, if we were to have another sort of pandemic like this, uh, you know, I think it would be different to some extent, the way it would work out. (..) I think the challenge is, is I think that a lot of what we've done, a lot of the infrastructure we've built is really about that hypothesis driven research model with data collection and data management and centralization of that. (..) I, I honestly think my background is more on the other part surveillance model where you're generating information and you're trying to like, you know, uh, make decisions about where you're going to allocate your resources as opposed to trying to like, I mean, not, not that the knowledge that comes out of the studies isn't helpful, but it's, you know, it's a much slower process. Uh, and to be honest, the more value knowledge came out of the original study, probably like we haven't generated a lot of knowledge of secondary studies yet because people look at this time scale is so much slower, right? It takes, you gotta get the data in, you gotta get standardized. It's really almost a post pandemic resource, if you will, at that level. Right. So I would think if we did it differently, I would think about how to do the post pandemic piece or this trial level data with a lighter touch, I would think, and a clear sense of the value and the users. And I would definitely ramp up the other side. The surveillance side. Yeah. (.) The challenge there, of course, is that that surveillance is usually a government agency role, but the government agencies that were all involved were all too slow and lacking in skill and resources to do it. So I think that, you know, there may have been, maybe when you talk to other people, you'll see, but my sense is that maybe there was an explicit desire to downplay that kind of surveillance monitoring aspect because it would be seen as more stepping on toes. Right. But at the same time, that's what was needed. Right. So, so that's, that's the one piece I struggle with about how it might be different if we have to do this again, is that, you know, to do that, it was sort of like, let's do it and ask for forgiveness as opposed to try and get agreement before we do it, because we never would have got agreement across governments to do that.</pre>

<pre>I mean, it's like, I mean, we're, I think we're done with the intro, but like the sake of editorializing a little bit, it's like from looking at like the meta research space and like the meta research as a field, it, it's almost like the people who are doing this research are talking about, or the value they're getting is like, how can we make science better? Not what can we actually see about, well, not, not meta analysis. It's like, it's like, what can we do? It's almost like, how can we, it's all meta. It's all about research practice, not actually about the research itself. (...) So you're talking about this stuff about improving performance and improving efficiency and stuff like this. It's like the, the people who look at open, like open data, the people who look at open data really intensely tend to look at how the data are generated. It's almost like navel gazing in a way, but it's productive, but it's also not. It's also not what it was intended for.</pre>

So, uh, they were, they were particularly, um, slow and problematic in terms of trying to get, um, them to share data, non-yielding, essentially. And that was perhaps not a function of their investigators per se, but rather the very strict data sharing protocols that they had identified with their cohorts that they felt could not in any way be violated.</pre>

And someone who's, like, in the social sciences and humanities come from an archaeology background, and I've done this kind of research in archaeology. I've come to see epidemiology as bread and butter as data analysis, as secondary data analysis in particular.

<pre>Yeah, no, I think, um, the academic culture is, is, um, very averse to data sharing. Mm-hmm. Um, just because individuals, um, you know, are proprietary with respect to, you know, rushing to publish and, and, uh, not, you know, not lose their ideas. Um, so I think that, um, is it, I think the second is these privacy, this, this hyper sense of privacy of individual health information where you have, you know, committees set up to safeguard individual protections. I think that creates a culture of, that somehow sharing is, is anathema to individual protection, um, of data. Um, and, uh, and then, uh, the third is there's an absence of a recognition of the value of understanding, uh, the big picture at a, a macro level. Um, because most people don't, um, don't operate on that level, uh, and so they're happy with their own little piece of cake and, uh, don't want to make it more complex. So, um, I think there are huge cultural barriers to, uh, to data sharing, which are particularly problematic in Canada. Not limited to Canada, but, um, there are other places in the world where it's no big deal because the culture is to share and the reality is those countries are kicking our butts when it comes to getting a sense of what's going on quickly.</pre>

So, this discussion is going to focus on what data access requests entail and the relationships with requesting parties. And maybe after the Data Access Committee meeting, we could meet to ascertain impressions on how it went, what factors were prioritized, and plans for future work. And it doesn't necessarily have to record an interview. It could just be a discussion that we take notes on after. You know, so, just to get a sense of, I mean, it doesn't have to be like a formal thing, you know?

<pre>So, I don't mind starting on this one. So, we had a request in from the University of North Carolina. (.) It had one main principal investigator, and it's mainly focused in on better understanding vaccine efficacy. They were looking to access a multitude of variables, but ultimately, they've been in our portal for a few months now. So, we have a fairly good idea of the way that they want to go about the project. They gave us a very clear outline of the research that they're hoping to engage in, since their documentation was pretty open-shut. But mainly, the lay summary gave us a very good idea around how they wanted to simulate, I believe, how the population modeling could be laid out for a COVID booster vaccine dose. (.) And I think that as we've been able to better understand kind of what they've wanted from us, it's been a pretty smooth experience overall. I think I probably missed a few points on the plan overall. I think it's looking to take a modeling approach to their pharmacokinetic population dynamics. So, I think Tanya could speak more to that, but I'm sure there's parts they missed. So, Tanya, go ahead.

We don't do a scientific review, so I am actually trying not to be opinionated about that because I do tend to be very opinionated about analysis. So, I'm trying to take it at face value, but I just have a quick look at it in case anything pops out. Like, I think that they're not being realistic about what they can do with the data. It would have to be pretty far, like, you know, a pretty glaring problem for me to say anything, though, because it's ultimately up to them. (.) So, I don't have anything to add to the...

We're both very quantitative. There's been a lot of faculty back and forth, so that might be the reason that, uh, that things were, were so aligned.

Um, so, the exact workflow of, like, when they, you know, what exactly they can consult, uh, you know, what, like, the template agreement and at what stage they agree to it, that's currently, um, uh, that, that's been, like, the biggest thing that's been in flux, uh, throughout their application.

So I'm just, sorry, I would just reiterate. And, and I, I mean, I think, uh, so Acleel mentioned all of the, um, uh, the research project descriptions that they give, but I'd like to just reiterate, there's sort of like three levels of detail, three documents with a different, uh, amount of depth in each. So the most depth is what they give, what they provided to their ethics board. They also have to upload that. Then they have, then they provide a, a summary, which is, can still be sort of in somewhat technical language, enough detail for us to understand. And then they also have to write a lay summary with, you know, not, not technical. So, um, that is not, you know, that's not totally that, that, that, you know, level of, of detail and writing style is not obvious, I think for all researchers and they, they provided sort of exactly what I think we, we hope for in that, those three, um, types of levels of detail and, and writing style. Whereas a previous, um, a previous one did not. And we had to give some prompting about like how, how to write those.

<pre>So I've been on board a scientific planning committee, which did not necessarily work with quantitative data or as, um, quantitative as this. Um, we were a part of creating, um, a health curriculum, uh, to be disseminated to medical students in Canada. So I was on the scientific planning end of that, and there were, um, obstacles and approvals that have somewhat of an over overlap, but I think it's, um, I would say it's outside of the realm of data sharing, but regardless, it was some form of scientific monitoring and, um, having perspectives from, um, legal folks as well. So it has a bit of an overlap, but, um, I think it's a much more different realm. That's much more health promotion focused rather than, um, data centralization. (..)

<pre>I would say so because I think it helps me keep it, um, somewhat siloed because, um, in our grant planning, we, um, we have long-term goals to be able to establish a scientific planning committee, um, and in order to better understand what a data access committee is, it's also helps to understand what it isn't, um, therefore I think it, um, it keeps, um, some understanding at bay of how these approvals proceed, um, and I think that despite the fact that I haven't necessarily, um, been on a data access committee per se, scientific planning committees tend to have, um, like a governance formatting that's a bit similar in that there needs to be in terms of reference tabulated and recruitment and those initial processes of getting the committee together are very similar. Once procedures begin, it starts to look very different.

Um, but, um, but, uh, a colleague of mine, um, took, really took the lead on it when it was being developed. Um, and then, so like Akhil said, we do an administrative review and, um, I have a look at the, um, the, the summaries, um, for glaring prop, you know, what I see might be glaring, uh, potential problems in their, um, understanding of how the, the, the data might contribute to their study because they don't have a ton of information. You know, we try to, you know, that we've got these, um, data descriptions and the data dashboard, but it still doesn't give you, doesn't give people that much information about the data.

It's more, um, trusting that the investigator has, um, had their protocol reviewed by, um, colleagues, uh, or part of a funding, um, grant. And then, um, so we are assuming that they've had, uh, a peer scientific review and the ethics review. And so our committee is looking that, looking at whether those seem to have been sort of, (.) yes, the, the, the, the professional understood definition of, of those, but they don't do a full scientific review and ethics review themselves. Right. (.) And then they'll also be, uh, you know, they don't have a lot of, uh, insight, like detailed information about the data, but if they had any, but they bring sort of their medical and data and lived experience with COVID and all that to, um, to the question also, you know, (.) even though it has gone under scientific review, if they have any concerns, then they, it's perfectly within their mandate to, to raise those concerns and discuss it with the, with the committee and the chair.

So they do aim at least to, um, look at the qualifications of the PI, to look at, uh, the feasibility of the application. They also, uh, review compliance aspects. So, you know, um, identification, uh, uh, indigenous considerations. Um, and yeah, um, so after they kind of look through that overarching criteria on the, um, on the request fund, they also aim to look into, uh, a few key aspects of, you know, institutional affiliation, as well as, you know, any collaborators that may be on board looking to, uh, clarify a bit more about the methodology as well. But, um, if there isn't already clear use of what, um, CITF data bank data will be, um, used for looking into that kind of scientific merit and feasibility of that, uh, they also, you know, there's that, um, coverage on ethics, um, mainly, um, aspects around, you know, if they, if they do go into the lay summary, it, it's really maybe trying to make that lay summary more accessible and, like, that avoidance of, like, complex language overall. Um, yeah, and just, like, reiterating on, like, that institutional, um, affiliation and just, um, really, um, independence of the researcher overall. Um, so that could be a university prof. It could be an independent researcher, however it may be. (..)

<pre>Right, because the, the, the data are, are intended for research. So it could be research in industry and, you know, government, but, um, some, yeah, there's kind of a bit of a funny situation where if the person's doing, is doing research, you know, seems to legitimately be doing research, but maybe the country or institution that they're from doesn't require, uh, ethics review, then they are, they have the opportunity to check that their, their institution does not require ethics review. (.) And so, so that's kind of interesting so that that's, you know, possibly, you know, it hasn't come up yet, but it's something that the, the DAC would then be able to, you know, decide how they, whether they think that's a concern or not. And even in very, you know, um, ethics review boards, we do require like an additional layer of, um, care about indigenous communities and other potentially, uh, you know, um, historically marginalized or currently, whatever, you know, sensitive populations.

Or, or we were sort of accustomed to the same documentation or, you know, the style of documentation of, and of describing. What would account for that? (...) I don't know how widespread it is. I mean, I, um, but you know, the big, like the big, big, um, society for epidemiology research, SER. I mean, that's a massive conference and they, they have the, the, their journal, the, the American Journal of Epidemiology. And that, that group that, um, has a very big influence at, at McGill and at UNC, as well as many other. (.) Um, and it's, um, so I, I don't have a very deep understanding of this, but I think it's maybe a little bit different from, um, the international or European, uh, epidemiologic society. Um, in, I don't know, I'd say in terms of, um, I think there's been some, not divisions, but slightly philosophical differences. When it comes to causal inference, you know, like, I just, I feel like, uh, McGill is a little more closely aligned with, um, the Americans than, uh, international. Not that there's big divides.

Like there's two of them have, are, were, uh, funded by CITF for, for projects. And then we've come up, uh, also like in, in looking for, um, a replacement for, uh, Dr. Gable. And when we talked about the science advisory board, um, there's definitely seems to be, um, uh, a preference for reaching out to people, um, he knows, or that had some kind of connection. And, um, that's not something that I would have known to do or know if there's any, you know, what, what the pros and cons of that are. Um, I think, I think it's hard to get people to agree to these, you know, academic service, unpaid academic service. (.)

So there's, I wouldn't say it's, I mean, personally, I'm not, it's an interview, I shouldn't be intervening like this, but I don't think it's that bad. (...) Um, and, uh, but I was, I was mainly wondering, like, if, you know, you're looking up these, you know, the, the UNC, you know, PI through Google search or whatnot, or the academic website, you know, of, you know, the academic website or their website on UNC website, on the UNC page. Um, is there ever any kind of word of mouth kind of like acknowledgement of what they do or what value they might get out of this?

And because already, like, because there's, hasn't been, you know, when we were trying to get things set up and, um, and there hasn't, haven't been applications, it's so easy to talk to people from McGill and, and talk about the data casually and, you know, hallway conversations.

<pre>Miguel. (.) UNC. So I think what happened was that the, um, the, uh, the PI shared the, uh, data access agreement template with their contracts officer, which is, you know, maybe their policy. Um, and, uh, and then the, their contracts officer wrote to our contracts officer with, um, proposed edits and, and questions and concerns about the data access agreement template. Right. And then our, um, um, contracts office was not able to get to that for several months. And so it's only, uh, been in the last month, three weeks to a month that we've been able to, you know, actively get back to the UNC contracts office with, um, proposed changes. Um, and luckily there, that they were fine with that. There was, so there didn't actually end up being a lot of back and forth needed. I think they brought up very good points that, um, David and our contracts office was, uh, felt were, you know, reasonable and, um, and really makes the, the, the whole, the, the, uh, template, you know, default template much better, much more robust.

So he had that, um, you know, models from both to, to work off of. But, but so that email, that initial email between UNC and Carol, I, and David, I think we could share. And then you'd see the, um, the before and after and the, and the points and David's response to the points. I think we're fine to share with that, but, or maybe check with David first.
