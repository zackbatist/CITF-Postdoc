    "section": "Methodology",
    "text": "Methodology\n\nApproach\nThis study is informed by a set of theoretical and methodological frameworks formed within a more interdisciplinary “science studies” tradition, which contribute to a more sociological outlook on science as cultural practice (cf. Pickering 1992). In practical terms, I will document the social and collaborative experiences involved in various research practices, which ultimately bind the many ways in which scientists do science.\nI will specifically focus on how people contribute to and extract from information commons, which comprise both formal documents and mutually-held and information-laden situated experiences. This involves examining the ways in which participation in disciplinary or even more specialized communities of practice fosters mutual understanding about the potential and limitations pertaining to other people’s data; and how this communally-held knowledge is accessed and re-produced. This approach aligns with the situated cognition methodological framework for examining the improvised, contingent and embodied experiences of human activity, including science (cf. Suchman 2007; Haraway 1988).\nThe situated cognition framework prioritizes subjects’ outlooks, which are contextualized by their prior experiences, and enables scholars to trace how people make sense of their environments and work with the physical and conceptual tools available to them to resolve immediate challenges. Situated cognition therefore lends itself to investigating rather fluid, open-ended and affect-oriented actions, and is geared towards understanding how actors draw from their prior experiences to navigate unique situations.\nSituated cognition is especially salient in explorations of how people who are learning new skills learn how to work in new and possibly unfamiliar ways, and in this sense is closely related to Lave and Wenger’s (1991) theory of situated learning (or ‘communities of practice’ approach), which focuses on how individuals acquire professional skills in relation to their social environments. In such situations, situated cognition enables observers to examine how people align their perspectives as work progresses, and to understand better how people’s general outlooks may have changed under the guidance of more experienced mentors. In other words, situated cognition enables researchers of scientific practices to account for discursive aspects of work, including perceived relationships, distinctions or intersections between practices that professional or research communities deem acceptable and unacceptable, and the cultural or community-driven aspects of decisions that underlie particular actions.\nIn taking on this theoretical framework, I frame epidemiology as a collective endeavour to derive a coherent understanding of population-level health trends, which involves the use of already established knowledge in the validation of newly formed ideas, and which relies on systems designed to carry information obtained with different chains of inference. These systems have both technical and social elements. The technical elements are the means through which information becomes encoded onto information objects so that they may form the basis for further inference. The social elements constitute a series of norms or expectations that facilitate the delegation of roles and responsibilities among agents who contribute their time, effort and accumulated knowledge to communal goals.\nAs such, in constructing the arguments of this study and in carrying out the fieldwork that grounds it, I will rely upon both realist and constructivist viewpoints. In one sense, I rely on documenting how people actually act, including the longer-term and collaborative implications that their actions may have on other work occurring throughout the continuum of practice. To accomplish this, I identify research activities from the perspective of an outside observer. I also ascribe meanings to things (such as physical or conceptual tools, or objects that captivate subjects’ interests) in ways that conform to my own perspective as an investigator of scientific research practices.\nOn the other hand, a constructionist perspective enables me to consider how individual agents make components of information systems suit their needs to facilitate communication or interoperability among actors who hold different situated perspectives. By listening to participants’ views about the systems with which they engage, including explanations as to why they act in the ways that they do, I am able to trace the assumptions and taken-for-granted behaviours that frame their perspectives. Moreover, these insights are useful for developing a better understanding of how participants identify with particular disciplinary communities and their perception of their roles within broader collective efforts.\nUltimately, this study is about the social order of scientific research, i.e. the frameworks, mindsets or sets of values that humans adopt to carry out their work in specific ways. Human beings rely upon physical and conceptual apparatus to do this work but, in order to understand how they do science in ways that conform to the epistemic mandates of the scientific enterprise, it is necessary to prioritize attention to human intention, drivers and pressures. I am emphasizing the agency of human drivers – as opposed to tools and procedures2 – since humans are the ones who (a) identify problems that need to be resolved; (b) imagine, project or predict potential outcomes of various kinds of actions that they may select to resolve the challenges; and (c) learn from prior experiences and change their behaviours accordingly. By highlighting how pragmatic actions are conducted in relation to broader social and discursive trends and tendencies, I consider scholarly practices in terms of potential, certainty and desire from the perspectives of practitioners themselves.\n\n\nData\nThis paper will draw from interviews with epidemiological researchers and those who support epidemiological data integration. Interviews will be driven by an emphasis on documenting the process of reconciling different stakeholders’ interests as they converge in the formation of a common data stream. Specifically, interviews will focus on motivations for their data harmonization work, the challenges they experience, how they envision success and failure, their perceptions of their own roles and the roles of other stakeholders, the values that inform their decisions, how the technological apparatus they set up enables them to realize their goals and values, and things they consider to be missing from data-sharing initiatives they have experienced thus far.\nI will hold around 12-15 interviews and analyze participants elicitations using qualitative data analysis methods. Interviewees will comprise members of several projects that partner with the Maelstrom research group, a service that supports data harmonization efforts in the field of epidemiology. My selection of cases reflects a need to account for a wide range of decisions and values accounted for in data harmonization efforts.\nData collection will be facilitated by the fact that many of the projects are based in Canada, and specifically in Montreal – where the principal researcher currently resides. This may introduce some bias toward prioritizing local connections (as opposed to Maelstrom’s work with European- and American-led projects) and increased visibility toward collaborative benefits that accompany local cooperation. However, this seems to be intrinsic to Maelstrom’s roots, and may not really be an aberration.\nI will record all interviews using a SONY ICD-UX560 audio recorder to capture audio in the lossless 16 bit 44.1 kHz Linear PCM wav format. I may apply additional audio filters to enhance audio playback while transcribing selected sections of interview records, depending on the degree of noise interference present during the interviews. I will also record interview sessions using a GoPro Hero 4 Silver action camera, pending interviewees’ informed consent. Based on prior interviews with scientists about their research experiences, I found that interviewees like to show me, rather than merely tell me, about what they are working on and the means through which they engage with information systems. The action cameras may be leveraged to record spontaneous video records of these demonstrations and provide me with an additional rich data source for further analysis. Moreover, the action cameras provide an additional backup audio recording in case of data loss on the primary recording device.\nI will record handwritten notes in bound notebooks. They will largely comprise descriptive documentation of activities and interactions when recording devices are not operating, as well as preliminary interpretations of observed behaviours and notes on things I plan to follow up on at a later time. I will scan these notebooks and transcribe the text so that these additional data sources could be included in the analytical corpus.\nI will transcribing the interviews and edit the transcripts so that they conform with transcript notation standards (e.g. GAT-2, see Selting, Auer, and Barth-Weingarten 2011) and so they are optimally formatted for my analytical intent. I will use automated speech recognition and natural language processing to create preliminary transcripts, which I will then manual edit. I may leverage support from a research assistant for these tasks.\nI will collect and handle all data in full compliance with an ethics protocol to be approved by McGill University’s research ethics board. I will present an overview of the research to all participants and obtain verbal consent prior to each interview before proceeding. I will opt to not render confidential the identities of study participants, but I will provide them with the option if they desire. This will include the ability to retroactively select this option up to one week after the interview has been completed. I will prompt interviewees about this option immediately after the termination of the interview and via email the day before the end of the one week period following the interview.\nSomething about data management plan [in progress]…\n\n\nMethods\nI will qualitatively analyze transcribed interviews to highlight the collaborative nature of work involved in harmonization of epidemiological data, which participants may struggle to identify or articulate. My analysis will involves an abductive qualitative data analysis methodology to articulate theories based on empirical evidence. This approach draws from what Charmaz (2014, 14–15) calls the “constellation of methods” associated with grounded theory that are helpful for making sense of qualitative data, namely coding and memoing.\nCoding, which involves defining what data are about in terms that are relevant to the theoretical frameworks that inform my research, entails rendering instances within a text as interpreted abstractions called codes (Charmaz 2014, 43). Codes can exist at various levels of abstraction. For instance, I may apply descriptive codes to characterize literal facets of an instance within a text, and theoretical codes to represent more interpretive concepts that correspond with aspects of particular theoretical frameworks. I may create many of my codes on the fly as “open codes” when prompted by encounters with demonstrative instances in the text. As I create new codes, I will situate them within a code system that provides me with a rough taxonomic structure to help organize my work and to enable me to more effectively query the data. Coding in this manner involves synthesis of concepts that speak to my understanding of the phenomena of interest, while forcing me to remain receptive to limits imposed by what is actually contained in the text. In other words, coding involves applying a precise language to segments of transcribed interviews that serve to bridge the gap between what participants said and the theoretical frameworks I applied to explore them as epistemic activities, interfaces and values (cf. Charmaz 2014; Saldaña 2011, 95–98).\nMemoing entails more open-ended exploration and reflection upon latent ideas in order to crystallize them into new avenues to pursue (Charmaz 2014, 72). Constructing memos is a relatively flexible way of engaging with data and serves as fertile ground for honing new ideas. Memoing is especially crucial while articulating sensitizing concepts, which Charmaz (2003, 259) refers to as the “points of departure from which to study the data”. Memoing allows me to take initial notions that lack specification of well-defined attributes, and gradually refine them into more cohesive, definitive concepts (Blumer 1954, 7; Bowen 2006). Exploring the main features, relationships or arrangements that underlie a superficial view of a sensitizing concept through memoing helps me to identify what kinds of things I need to locate in the data in order to gain a full understanding of the phenomena of interest. Memoing is also very important in the process of drawing out more coherent meaning from coded data (cf. Charmaz 2014, 181, 290–93). By creating memos pertaining to the intersections of various codes and drawing comparisons across similarly coded instances, I am able to form more robust and generalizable arguments about the phenomena of interest and relate them to alternative perspectives expressed by others.\nThroughout my analysis, I will follow the approach that Nicolini (2009) and Maryl et al. (2020, para. 30) advocate, who suggest “zooming in to a granular study of particular research activities and operations and zooming out to considering broader sociotechnical and cultural factors”. This involves “magnifying or blowing up the details of practice, switching theoretical lenses, and selective re-positioning so that certain aspects are fore-grounded and others are temporarily sent to the background” (Nicolini 2009, 1412). This approach is useful for me because research projects all start from different positions but share common practices and tendencies that vary according to those contextual circumstances. I am therefore able to tactfully switch between those lenses to understand the interplay between circumstances and practical implementations, which vary across cases, which have their own histories, memberships, sets of tools, methods, and social or political circumstances.ships, sets of tools, methods, and social or political circumstances.\nI will perform all of this work using MaxQDA, a proprietary qualitative data analysis software suite that stores all of these connections within a centralized database (VERBI Software 2021).3 This allows me to retrieve segments of text from across various documents that have been assigned the same sets of codes, and perform more complex queries that search along different parameters of overlap, intersection, and exclusion. I will then able to query the integrated dataset to produce elaborated accounts of specific kinds of activities, decisions, values and sentiments.",

    "text": "Appendix\n\nComments on Actor-Network Theory\nPrevious work examining the apparatus of science relies heavily on Actor-Network Theory (ANT) or similar approaches that highlight the agency and impacts of tools on research practice. These draw attention to how non-human objects not only frame how human beings inhabit the world, but “push back” upon human actions with significant effects (Latour 1992). In the context of early studies of scientific research, ANT was used to understand the physical and communicative mechanisms – made up of non-human agents and information objects – upon which scientists rely to capture, document and ascribe meaning to particular facets of the world (cf. Latour and Woolgar 1986). ANT posits that scientists can only identify, characterize and understand objects of interest by co-creating their conceptions of reality alongside non-human agents.\nFor instance, (Latour and Woolgar 1986) initially applied ANT to investigate how knowledge is produced by molecular biologists in a laboratory setting. In this work, they identified the processes of transcription and translation as mechanisms through which material engagements between non-human objects (i.e. objects of nature) are rendered in ways that may be understood by humans. For instance, in a biomolecular lab, a bioassay determines and represents the existence and qualities of discrete proteins that have been extracted from cell samples through reactions with specially selected reagents, marked with dyes selected for their non-reactive qualities, and pulled through a filtration medium that separates proteins according to their mass, molecular structure, and electromagnetic properties. A large number of material entities are thus selected and mobilized due to the researcher’s understanding that such an assemblage might contribute to the representation of a targeted set of phenomena. More specifically, certain reagents are added to cell samples that bind with proteins that constitute cell walls, allowing for inner proteins to be extracted. Other reagents that only bind to particular targeted proteins and that have been engineered to have certain identifiable physical and electromagnetic properties impart these qualities onto the now merged molecule composed of both targeted protein and reagent. Dyes that complement the design of the reagent and of the overall bioassay protocol are bound to these molecules, rendering them visible to the human eye. Molecules are then pulled through a conductive gel whose own material characteristics and density allow for only electrically charged molecules to be pulled through, given the placement of a polar-opposite charge at the far end of the gel. Once movement of the proteins have settled, (caused, in part, by the gradual solidification of the gel that inhibits further movement) the entire gel is photographed and the relative positions of dyed molecules are marked to denote their discrete existence and other relevant qualities rendered through association with their respective reagents. Knowledge was thus obtained by humans through the selective assembly of various material actors, whose interactions are already understood and deemed reliable, in order to render an account of reality based upon their projected experiences.\nSuch a comprehensive view of the system of interacting agents, however, betrays the pragmatic and situated nature of the process. Indeed, Latour and Woolgar (1986, 245) concluded that science is primarily concerned with the creation of an ordered account of reality, rather than the transfer of information pertaining to the world into human-understandable formats, and they characterize latter as the practices enacted in order to fulfill the former aim. However through a pragmatic lens, these two processes may be rendered as intertwined and inseparable threads of a unified experience of knowledge production.\nRealizing this, Knorr Cetina (2001) highlighted how every action taken in the production of knowledge is underpinned by a desire to fill a gap in knowledge. Integral to this approach is her definition of knowledge objects, which are defined as settled statements about the world, which tend to be the goal of most scientific pursuits. Knorr-Cetina illustrates this as drawers in a filing cabinet, which have been organized squarely and that are accessible for retrieval. In contrast, gaps in knowledge or unexpected behaviour are characterized as untidy and incomplete drawers that exist in an unresolved state. Knowledge objects are comparable to Latour and Woolgar’s (1986, 76) definition of facts as timeless and author-less accounts of reality, which have been elevated from the material systems that would otherwise constrain them as contingent to the specific material setup of the lab. However, Knorr-Cetina’s concept renders knowledge production as a more dynamic, constructive and situated process that involves the use of already established knowledge in the validation of newly arrived at ideas (Knorr Cetina 2001, 181–82).\nHer approach adds pragmatic and discursive elements, which help frame scholarly practices from the perspectives of the practitioners themselves, in terms of potentiality, certainty and desire. For instance, the desire of a lab technician to have the protein react as she expects it to will guide her practices, including her selection of reagents used to interact with it (Knorr Cetina 2001, 181). She thus alters the material assemblage of the system based upon her contextualization of what has or has not worked before, her educated hypothetical suppositions concerning the ways various actors might interact, and a reiteration of her goal. Her concern with the elusive nature of the protein thereby derives from her consideration of how the knowledge she might obtain will fit into the established order.\nKnorr Cetina’s work reveals how ANT does not adequately account for the circumstances through which the structures that support science come into being, nor the intentionality of human agents who assemble material apparatus to meet their goals. She refocuses attention on discursive aspects of knowledge production by considering expressions of potentiality, certainty and desire elicited by scientists as subjects acting with intent. This emphasis on the role of the subject, who conceives of other things from a unique perspective, introduces some asymmetry with respect to the roles of actors in the overall system. However, it does not totally dismiss the agency of non-human actors; it merely recognizes that the agency of objects are harnessed by humans and strategically configured into productive systems.\nIn other words, this approach recognizes that a scientific observer is needed to intervene, who ascribes meanings to materials, who delineates natural phenomena from modern cultural processes, and who selects signal from noise. It also enables science to be viewed as a collaborative and discursive process, comprising a convergence of methodologies and theoretical outlooks, often upon the same materials. This prompts recognition that ‘the scientific record’ exists in multiple forms, and varies according to the diverse range of perspectives that may characterize the objects of enquiry in different ways. When presenting their findings, scientists thus engage in discursive processes of semantic negotiation, comparing our own conceptions to those held by others.\nScientific data may therefore be considered as a connective medium that enables research to be conducted in a continuous and collaborative manner.\n\n\nContinua of practice\nThis notion of a continuum or network of practice is characterized by recognition of the diverse array of work enacted through collective effort to contribute to information commons. It accomplishes this by taking a pragmatic approach to understanding the situatedness, historicity and social contingency of work (Dallas 2015, 440; 2016).4 Dallas (2016) is explicit in his promotion of a landscape metaphor whose ecosystems and inhabitants negotiate their differences in a pragmatic manner rather than one that emphasizes control and resource. Moreover, this relates to Cole’s (1996) notion that culture is a permeable and layered substance that nurtures growth and development across uneven social landscapes. These views exemplify a broader trajectory that imagines knowledge work in ecological terms (cf. Star 1995).\nIn writing about specific issues regarding how scholarly content originating from various domains is professionally curated, Dallas brings attention to the ways in which such ecological metaphors might actually be applied. In his view, intellectual and pragmatic inquiry pertaining to the mindsets of the domains of knowledge production is necessary in order to better curate the meanings and intents behind archived material. Curation, for Dallas, is a continual process of interpretation and re-presentation; as objects (either physical or conceptual) are engaged with from various perspectives, they are ascribed new meanings. In other words, each interlocutor who engages with an object passing through their care as part of a curatorial process renews the object’s meaning in ways that both reflect the object’s history and shape its potential down the line. It is thus necessary, according to Dallas, to inquire about the ways in which domain specialists come to know an object and situate it as part of their lives in order to preserve and present the object in ways that adequately reflect its accrued meanings. This requires greater integration of domain specialists as part of curatorial workflows in order to better account for their outlooks as active stakeholders.\nThis outlook is interesting because it more clearly makes use of the notion that objects are sites of negotiation. Dallas (2015) applies these ideas to consider the ways in which the archaeological record is formulated and made meaningful in various ways throughout inherently collaborative, discursive and interdisciplinary archaeological projects. Indeed, his use-case is exemplary since relics, ruins and artefacts out of their original contexts serve as opportunistic lenses through which fragmentary glimpses of alternative realities might be captured. As Huvila (2016) notes, archaeological site reports, which are typically considered to represent the conclusive findings of a project, are produced from a series of complex negotiations among stakeholder specialists, but also present lopsided accounts of the knowledge recovered from the site; the organizational structure of archaeological projects, and the inherent epistemic limitations that guide the logistics and culture of the discipline, shape the final product and influence how it will be used in later secondary research contexts. In this sense, archaeological projects resemble, to some degree, “wicked” problems, whose contradictions, incompleteness and social complexity render them resistant to completely satisfying resolutions (Rittel and Webber 1973). However, further inquiry into the ways in which meanings are ascribed throughout the course of a project, as they accrue via pragmatic and situated experiences, may help to gain a better understanding of the tensions and relationships at play. By highlighting the complex textures of work contributed by various members of a project, those who wish to use the generated knowledge in alternative arenas of practice may gain a better feel for the ways in which it was woven, and thus use it more effectively.\nPaying close attention to the minute and pragmatic aspects of practice, is, according to Latour and Woolgar (1999, 24), what those in the fields of ‘science studies’ do best. By studying the particularities of what scientists actually do, and the ways in which they relate to things through series of coordinated social and technological mechanisms, we may be able to understand flows of knowledge across a continuum of understanding. By observing how professionals communicate and connect with each other and with the phenomena that captivate their interests, we can come to better understand the epistemic culture – the mindsets that drive curiosity and foster growth – which shapes the ways that they understand the world (Knorr Cetina 1999). As a result, scientific research, framed as a wide variety of active and cooperative engagements among people and objects, become situated alongside other ways of knowing. This is particularly important in a world where Mertonian notions of scholarly tribalism between the sciences, social sciences and humanities remain pervasive, despite many years of critique demonstrating that all scholarship actually occurs along an open continuum. In addition to helping foster more genuine cross-disciplinary encounters, recognition of the cultural situatedness of scholarship will enable scholars to more effectively operate in public and contribute towards the potential resolution of wicked problems.",

You’ll be able to shift the arrangement of webpages by reordering/adding/deleting them in the _quarto.yml file following the patterns you see in this example.\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml and website side-by-side\n\n\nNotice that there are multiple ways in the _quarto.yml for you to include a file in your website. For example, in the above image, the “First Observations” we see in the left sidebar of the published website (right image) is represented in _quarto.yml (left image) over two lines, with line 36 indicating the file reference and line 37 indicating the text to show up in the left sidebar. However, “From RStudio” is only represented in one line of _quarto.yml, on line 43. This represents two strategies for including a file in your website. By default, the title of a specified file will show up in the website’s sidebar, which is what is happening with the “From RStudio” example. If you would like more control over what is written in the sidebar vs the title of your files, then the approach we took with “First Observations” is what you’ll want to do: you’ll see that only “First Observations” shows up in the sidebar as we specified in _quarto.yml, but the page’s title says “First Observations & Setup” (which in our preference was too long for the sidebar).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs you modify _quarto.yml, the most important thing to know is that spacing matters. Pay attention to whether text is indented by one, two, four, or other spaces, and make sure you follow it; if your site is not looking as expected it is likely a silent error in your YAML. Some text editors like RStudio provide debugging support for YAML and are highly recommended to save you time and heartache."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Last week (2024/12/04) I finally met with David Buckeridge, Tanya Murphy and Aklil Noza in person. The meeting was meant to convey my vision for the project to the whole team, to align perspectives, and to articulate how this will actually work in practice.\nThe gist is that I will be investigating the role of social and cultural factors in data-sharing initiatives such as CITF and other Maelstrom-affiliated projects, and how these relate to, overlap with, or conflict with technical and institutional/administrative factors. To be clear, these are all very important aspects of data-sharing, but we generally recognized that the social and cultural aspects are under-explored relative to their impact.\nWe briefly talked about how we will go about selecting cases, and I emphasized the importance of strategic case selection. This also involves carefully articulating the project’s goals so that the cases will complement them. We agreed that the dataset will likely comprise between 12-15 interviews of around 60-90 minutes in length with representatives from 4-5 cases (one of them being CITF), in addition to representatives of the Maelstrom team. Maelstrom will serve as a “fixed point” that limits the scope of the cases’ breadth and ensures that participants have a common frame of reference. It also potentially allows me to “offload” or “consolidate” reference to technical and administrative aspects of data-sharing through targeted interviews with Maelstrom personnel, instead of dealing with those things with the representatives for each case.\nWe discussed timelines and overlap with Aklil’s work, which will be more concerned with focus groups with CITF databank users. There is definitely overlap with the emphasis of my own work and we will coordinate data collection to enhance the potential for analytical alignment.\nAfter the meeting I chatted with Tanya and Aklil who helped familiarize me with the bigger-picture theoretical discourse and tensions in epidemiology. Much of it seemed familiar since these concerns are common across disciplines, but I still need to read more to concretize my understanding. Tanya recommended I read the “Baby Rothman” which is a condensed version of a very long-lived textbook in this field, among a few other papers she sent me.\nOverall, this meeting got me really excited about this project :)"

I might be able to write a custom CI workflow to archive specific files to Zenodo using their API. However, I want to be able to toggle this option, rather than have it occur for every single detected change. Maybe I can accomplish this by pushing the changes that I want to archive to a dedicated branch that the CI workflow is configured to operate on.

    "section": "Comments on Actor-Network Theory",
    "text": "Comments on Actor-Network Theory\nPrevious work examining the apparatus of science relies heavily on Actor-Network Theory (ANT) or similar approaches that highlight the agency and impacts of tools on research practice. These draw attention to how non-human objects not only frame how human beings inhabit the world, but “push back” upon human actions with significant effects (Latour 1992). In the context of early studies of scientific research, ANT was used to understand the physical and communicative mechanisms – made up of non-human agents and information objects – upon which scientists rely to capture, document and ascribe meaning to particular facets of the world (cf. Latour and Woolgar 1986). ANT posits that scientists can only identify, characterize and understand objects of interest by co-creating their conceptions of reality alongside non-human agents.\nFor instance, (Latour and Woolgar 1986) initially applied ANT to investigate how knowledge is produced by molecular biologists in a laboratory setting. In this work, they identified the processes of transcription and translation as mechanisms through which material engagements between non-human objects (i.e. objects of nature) are rendered in ways that may be understood by humans. For instance, in a biomolecular lab, a bioassay determines and represents the existence and qualities of discrete proteins that have been extracted from cell samples through reactions with specially selected reagents, marked with dyes selected for their non-reactive qualities, and pulled through a filtration medium that separates proteins according to their mass, molecular structure, and electromagnetic properties. A large number of material entities are thus selected and mobilized due to the researcher’s understanding that such an assemblage might contribute to the representation of a targeted set of phenomena. More specifically, certain reagents are added to cell samples that bind with proteins that constitute cell walls, allowing for inner proteins to be extracted. Other reagents that only bind to particular targeted proteins and that have been engineered to have certain identifiable physical and electromagnetic properties impart these qualities onto the now merged molecule composed of both targeted protein and reagent. Dyes that complement the design of the reagent and of the overall bioassay protocol are bound to these molecules, rendering them visible to the human eye. Molecules are then pulled through a conductive gel whose own material characteristics and density allow for only electrically charged molecules to be pulled through, given the placement of a polar-opposite charge at the far end of the gel. Once movement of the proteins have settled, (caused, in part, by the gradual solidification of the gel that inhibits further movement) the entire gel is photographed and the relative positions of dyed molecules are marked to denote their discrete existence and other relevant qualities rendered through association with their respective reagents. Knowledge was thus obtained by humans through the selective assembly of various material actors, whose interactions are already understood and deemed reliable, in order to render an account of reality based upon their projected experiences.\nSuch a comprehensive view of the system of interacting agents, however, betrays the pragmatic and situated nature of the process. Indeed, Latour and Woolgar (1986, 245) concluded that science is primarily concerned with the creation of an ordered account of reality, rather than the transfer of information pertaining to the world into human-understandable formats, and they characterize latter as the practices enacted in order to fulfill the former aim. However through a pragmatic lens, these two processes may be rendered as intertwined and inseparable threads of a unified experience of knowledge production.\nRealizing this, Knorr Cetina (2001) highlighted how every action taken in the production of knowledge is underpinned by a desire to fill a gap in knowledge. Integral to this approach is her definition of knowledge objects, which are defined as settled statements about the world, which tend to be the goal of most scientific pursuits. Knorr-Cetina illustrates this as drawers in a filing cabinet, which have been organized squarely and that are accessible for retrieval. In contrast, gaps in knowledge or unexpected behaviour are characterized as untidy and incomplete drawers that exist in an unresolved state. Knowledge objects are comparable to Latour and Woolgar’s (1986, 76) definition of facts as timeless and author-less accounts of reality, which have been elevated from the material systems that would otherwise constrain them as contingent to the specific material setup of the lab. However, Knorr-Cetina’s concept renders knowledge production as a more dynamic, constructive and situated process that involves the use of already established knowledge in the validation of newly arrived at ideas (Knorr Cetina 2001, 181–82).\nHer approach adds pragmatic and discursive elements, which help frame scholarly practices from the perspectives of the practitioners themselves, in terms of potentiality, certainty and desire. For instance, the desire of a lab technician to have the protein react as she expects it to will guide her practices, including her selection of reagents used to interact with it (Knorr Cetina 2001, 181). She thus alters the material assemblage of the system based upon her contextualization of what has or has not worked before, her educated hypothetical suppositions concerning the ways various actors might interact, and a reiteration of her goal. Her concern with the elusive nature of the protein thereby derives from her consideration of how the knowledge she might obtain will fit into the established order.\nKnorr Cetina’s work reveals how ANT does not adequately account for the circumstances through which the structures that support science come into being, nor the intentionality of human agents who assemble material apparatus to meet their goals. She refocuses attention on discursive aspects of knowledge production by considering expressions of potentiality, certainty and desire elicited by scientists as subjects acting with intent. This emphasis on the role of the subject, who conceives of other things from a unique perspective, introduces some asymmetry with respect to the roles of actors in the overall system. However, it does not totally dismiss the agency of non-human actors; it merely recognizes that the agency of objects are harnessed by humans and strategically configured into productive systems.\nIn other words, this approach recognizes that a scientific observer is needed to intervene, who ascribes meanings to materials, who delineates natural phenomena from modern cultural processes, and who selects signal from noise. It also enables science to be viewed as a collaborative and discursive process, comprising a convergence of methodologies and theoretical outlooks, often upon the same materials. This prompts recognition that ‘the scientific record’ exists in multiple forms, and varies according to the diverse range of perspectives that may characterize the objects of enquiry in different ways. When presenting their findings, scientists thus engage in discursive processes of semantic negotiation, comparing our own conceptions to those held by others.\nScientific data may therefore be considered as a connective medium that enables research to be conducted in a continuous and collaborative manner.",

    "text": "Continua of practice\nThis notion of a continuum or network of practice is characterized by recognition of the diverse array of work enacted through collective effort to contribute to information commons. It accomplishes this by taking a pragmatic approach to understanding the situatedness, historicity and social contingency of work (Dallas 2015, 440; 2016).4 Dallas (2016) is explicit in his promotion of a landscape metaphor whose ecosystems and inhabitants negotiate their differences in a pragmatic manner rather than one that emphasizes control and resource. Moreover, this relates to Cole’s (1996) notion that culture is a permeable and layered substance that nurtures growth and development across uneven social landscapes. These views exemplify a broader trajectory that imagines knowledge work in ecological terms (cf. Star 1995).\nIn writing about specific issues regarding how scholarly content originating from various domains is professionally curated, Dallas brings attention to the ways in which such ecological metaphors might actually be applied. In his view, intellectual and pragmatic inquiry pertaining to the mindsets of the domains of knowledge production is necessary in order to better curate the meanings and intents behind archived material. Curation, for Dallas, is a continual process of interpretation and re-presentation; as objects (either physical or conceptual) are engaged with from various perspectives, they are ascribed new meanings. In other words, each interlocutor who engages with an object passing through their care as part of a curatorial process renews the object’s meaning in ways that both reflect the object’s history and shape its potential down the line. It is thus necessary, according to Dallas, to inquire about the ways in which domain specialists come to know an object and situate it as part of their lives in order to preserve and present the object in ways that adequately reflect its accrued meanings. This requires greater integration of domain specialists as part of curatorial workflows in order to better account for their outlooks as active stakeholders.\nThis outlook is interesting because it more clearly makes use of the notion that objects are sites of negotiation. Dallas (2015) applies these ideas to consider the ways in which the archaeological record is formulated and made meaningful in various ways throughout inherently collaborative, discursive and interdisciplinary archaeological projects. Indeed, his use-case is exemplary since relics, ruins and artefacts out of their original contexts serve as opportunistic lenses through which fragmentary glimpses of alternative realities might be captured. As Huvila (2016) notes, archaeological site reports, which are typically considered to represent the conclusive findings of a project, are produced from a series of complex negotiations among stakeholder specialists, but also present lopsided accounts of the knowledge recovered from the site; the organizational structure of archaeological projects, and the inherent epistemic limitations that guide the logistics and culture of the discipline, shape the final product and influence how it will be used in later secondary research contexts. In this sense, archaeological projects resemble, to some degree, “wicked” problems, whose contradictions, incompleteness and social complexity render them resistant to completely satisfying resolutions (Rittel and Webber 1973). However, further inquiry into the ways in which meanings are ascribed throughout the course of a project, as they accrue via pragmatic and situated experiences, may help to gain a better understanding of the tensions and relationships at play. By highlighting the complex textures of work contributed by various members of a project, those who wish to use the generated knowledge in alternative arenas of practice may gain a better feel for the ways in which it was woven, and thus use it more effectively.\nPaying close attention to the minute and pragmatic aspects of practice, is, according to Latour and Woolgar (1999, 24), what those in the fields of ‘science studies’ do best. By studying the particularities of what scientists actually do, and the ways in which they relate to things through series of coordinated social and technological mechanisms, we may be able to understand flows of knowledge across a continuum of understanding. By observing how professionals communicate and connect with each other and with the phenomena that captivate their interests, we can come to better understand the epistemic culture – the mindsets that drive curiosity and foster growth – which shapes the ways that they understand the world (Knorr Cetina 1999). As a result, scientific research, framed as a wide variety of active and cooperative engagements among people and objects, become situated alongside other ways of knowing. This is particularly important in a world where Mertonian notions of scholarly tribalism between the sciences, social sciences and humanities remain pervasive, despite many years of critique demonstrating that all scholarship actually occurs along an open continuum. In addition to helping foster more genuine cross-disciplinary encounters, recognition of the cultural situatedness of scholarship will enable scholars to more effectively operate in public and contribute towards the potential resolution of wicked problems.",

    "text": "Case Study Research\nCases usually share common reference to the overall research themes, but exhibit variations that enable a researcher to capture different outlooks or perspectives on matters of common concern. Drawing from multiple cases thus enables comprehensive coverage of a broad topic that no single case may cover on its own.\nIn other words, cases are contexts that ascribe particular local flavours to the activities I trace, and which I must consider to account fully for the range of motivations, circumstances and affordances that back decisions to perform activities and to implement them in specific ways.\nMoreover, the power of case study research derives from identifying consistencies that relate cases to each other, while simultaneously highlighting how their unique and distinguishing facets contribute to their representativeness of the underlying phenomon. Case study research therefore plays on the tensions that challenge relationships among cases and the phenomenon that they are being called upon to represent.\nGrounded theory is commonly employed in research concerned with identifying intersecting and overlapping social values. Ggrounded theory makes it possible to draw out the common and patterned themes that cut across cases, while simultaneously reflecting on the unique circumstances that differentiate them. Specifically, I follow the approach that Maryl et al. (2020: para. 30) and Nicolini (2009) advocate, who suggest “zooming in to a granular study of particular research activities and operations and zooming out to considering broader socio-technical and cultural factors”. This involves “magnifying or blowing up the details of practice, switching theoretical lenses, and selective re-positioning so that certain aspects are fore-grounded and others are temporarily sent to the background” (Nicolini 2009: 1412).\nThis approach is useful for me because data-sharing initiatives all start from different positions but share common practices and tendencies that vary according to those contextual circumstances. Thus, I can tactfully switch between those lenses to understand the interplay between circumstances and practical implementations.",

I might be able to write a custom CI workflow to archive specific files to Zenodo using their API. However, I want to be able to toggle this option, rather than have it occur for every single detected change. Maybe I can accomplish this by pushing the changes that I want to archive to a dedicated branch that the CI workflow is configured to operate on.

    "text": "Targets\nThe Maelstrom initiative presents a great opportunity to explore how social and material factors are being accounted for in data harmonization efforts. Maelstrom partners with research projects through initial consultations, which may then evolve into more comprehensive data harmonization work. This is contingent on the value proposition that Maelstrom and partner projects ascertain will derive from harmonization, and evaluation of the feasibility of achieving these outcomes. Already, this approach differentiates itself from raw open data-sharing in that it is directed by specific objectives, recognizes limitations of practical circumstances surrounding data’s creation and the data harmonization efforts, and maintains the option to not proceed if it is deemed prudent to do so.\nMoreover, there appears to be quite a bit of flexibility in the Maelstrom approach. Consultations may take different forms, and may terminate upon realization of different limiting factors. In other words, Maelstrom’s involvement seems to be responsive to specific circumstances on a project-by-project basis. This variability is very well suited for exploring how harmonization accounts for different social and material factors. As such, to interrogate a wide breath of factors accounted for in data harmonization efforts, I will need to conduct interviews with participants from several Maelstrom partner projects, in addition to the CITF.\n\nRelevance\nThis project is directly relevant to ongoing developments in the open data landscape. As the open data movement begins to mature, cracks are beginning to reveal themselves in the infrastructures we have built thus far. Critical inspection is therefore necessary to help improve these systems and ensure that they may continue to support research activities.\nMoreover, as a case study on community-oriented data-sharing initiatives, this project is well equipped to draw attention to the support structures (or lack thereof) for these efforts. Specifically, the project will contribute to a better understanding of what resources are necessary to improve data-sharing at large and small scales.\nThis is especially relevant in the Canadian context, where open science policy has been undergoing major revisions for several years now, and which inspires little confidence in researchers concerning expected outcomes. Researchers have therefore taken it upon themselves to develop data-sharing initiatives on their own terms. This entrepreneurialism has been a boon for community-driven data-sharing, but is also plagued by difficulties, which this project will be the first of its kind to explore.\n\n\nResearch Questions\nStill in progress…",
