  <title>Technical specs for this website</title>
  <dc:creator>Zack Batist</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I am using this website as a way to help organize and share key documents and resources. The research protocols are in flux at this stage in the project’s development, and this will make it easier to distribute up-to-date drafts with partners, while simultaneously enhancing transparency.</p>
<p>This post outlines the technical specifications for this website and outlines a roadmap for its further development. It will therefore be continually updated as the site evolves.</p>
<section id="fundamentals" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h2>
<p>This website is based on <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">hugo</a>, using the <a href="https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book/">hugo-book</a> theme. I decided on hugo because I already have some passing familiarity with it, and the theme looks nice, simple, expandable and well-supported.</p>
<p>It is hosted on GitHub Pages using a CI workflow to automatically generate the site upon changes being pushed to the repo, which is located at https://github.com/zackbatist/CITF-Postdoc. I’m making an effort to ensure that the site can be ported to another hosting provider if necessary.</p>
</section>
<section id="citations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="citations">Citations</h2>
<p>Since this site primarily contains academic writing, I need to integrate this with my citation workflow, and I’m using <a href="https://github.com/joksas/hugo-simplecite">hugo-simplecite</a> to help accomplish this. This works by having the <a href="https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex">better-bibtex</a> zotero plugin generate a continually-updated CSL-JSON file containing all relevant bibliographic references, which are referenced by the custom shortcodes provided by simplecite.</p>
<p>Simplecite currently only supports a single numerical endnote reference style but they have plans to implement additional styles, including an author-date format which I prefer. See <a href="https://github.com/joksas/hugo-simplecite/issues/6">my GitHub Issue</a> inquiring about this.</p>
<p>I tried using <a href="https://github.com/loup-brun/hugo-cite/">hugo-cite</a>, which simplecite is derived from, but I could not get it to work properly. It also does not seem to be maintained anymore, which prompted me to adopt simplecite instead.</p>
</section>
<section id="generating-pdfs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="generating-pdfs">Generating PDFs</h2>
<p>As an avid latex user, I do not really want to abandon PDFs entirely, and I’d like to figure out a way to generate PDF versions of the text rendered on the website. This could probably be accomplished using pandoc running through a CI workflow.</p>
<p>These PDFs will be tracked with git and I’ll configure a latex template to generate timestamps and references to their corresponding web versions.</p>
</section>
<section id="archiving-and-version-control" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="archiving-and-version-control">Archiving and Version Control</h2>
<p>Every change is tracked using git. However I would also like to find a way to archive each research protocol in Zenodo so that they can be assigned stable DOIs and detailed metadata, which will make them easier to reference.</p>
<p>I do not want to rely on Zenodo’s GitHub integration for two reasons: 1) I want this to be as platform-agnostic as possible, and 2) that system relies on GitHub’s release system which operates on the level of the whole repository rather than specific files. I might be able to write a custom CI workflow to archive specific files to Zenodo using their API. However, I want to be able to toggle this option, rather than have it occur for every single detected change. Maybe I can accomplish this by pushing the changes that I want to archive to a dedicated branch that the CI workflow is configured to operate on. Or it might be easier to simply do this manually, since I’m not sure I will be using it that often anyway.</p>

  <title>Reflection on first team meeting</title>
  <dc:creator>Zack Batist</dc:creator>
  <link>https://zackbatist.info/posts/2024-12-09-first-team-meeting/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Last week (2024/12/04) I finally met David, Tanya and Aklil in person. The meeting was meant to convey my vision for the project to the whole team, to align perspectives, and to articulate how this will actually work in practice.</p>
<p>The gist is that I will be investigating the role of social and cultural factors in data-sharing initiatives such as CITF and other Maelstrom-affiliated projects, and how these relate to, overlap with, or conflict with technical and institutional/administrative factors. To be clear, these are all very important aspects of data-sharing, but we generally recognized that the social and cultural aspects are under-explored relative to their impact.</p>
<p>We briefly talked about how we will go about selecting cases, and I emphasized the importance of strategic case selection. This also involves carefully articulating the project’s goals so that the cases will complement them. We agreed that the dataset will likely comprise between 12-15 interviews of around 60-90 minutes in length with representatives from 4-5 cases (one of them being CITF), in addition to representatives of the Maelstrom team. Maelstrom will serve as a “fixed point” that limits the scope of the cases’ breadth and ensures that participants have a common frame of reference. It also potentially allows me to “offload” or “consolidate” reference to technical and administrative aspects of data-sharing through targeted interviews with Maelstrom personnel, instead of dealing with those things with the representatives for each case.</p>
<p>We discussed timelines and overlap with Aklil’s work, which will be more concerned with focus groups with CITF databank users. There is definitely overlap with the emphasis of my own work and we will coordinate data collection to enhance the potential for analytical alignment.</p>
<p>After the meeting I chatted with Tanya and Aklil who helped familiarize me with the bigger-picture theoretical discourse and tensions in epidemiology. Much of it seemed familiar since these concerns are common across disciplines, but I still need to read more to concretize my understanding. Tanya recommended I read the “Baby Rothman” which is a condensed version of a very long-lived textbook in this field, among a few other papers she sent me.</p>
<p>Overall, this meeting got me really excited about this project :)</p>

  <title>Hello World!</title>

<p>Welcome to the website for my CITF Postdoc! This will serve as a hub for documenting and sharing my work. I decided to do this as a way of managing and sharing always-updated drafts of research protocols with my supervisor and team members, but it is also generally useful for keeping my thoughts organized. I will also use this blog section to write my thoughts as the project progresses.</p>
