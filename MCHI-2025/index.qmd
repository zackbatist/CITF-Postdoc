  A presentation for the McGill Clinical and Health Information Research Group.
  It is too soon for me to present any findings, so instead I'm talking about my research protocol and plan of action.

## What am I doing here? {.smaller}
::: {.fragment}
- Framing harmonization as information commons
  - Who contributes? Who extracts?
  - What are their converging and diverging interests?
  - What commitments do these interactions entail?
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Framing harmonization as value-driven
  - What are the targeted outcomes?
  - What is the projected value-added?
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Framing data work as improvized action
  - How do they go about trying to achieve these objectives?
  - Are their strategies successful? Why or why not?

## Interviews {.smaller}
::: {.fragment}
- Interviews with leaders and key stakeholders of data harmonization initiatives
:::

::: {.fragment}
- I will ask participants about:
  - The motivations for their initiatives
  - The challenges they experience
  - How they envision success and failure
  - Perceptions of their own roles and the roles of others
  - The values that inform their decisions
  - The systems that enable them to achieved their goals
  - Ways in which they believe data sharing could be improved

## Qualitative Data Analysis {.smaller}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="65%"}
::: {.fragment}
- Coding interview transcripts
  - Enable me to develop theory about their social actions
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Writing analytic memos
  - To synthesize broader concepts, themes and theories based on the encoded data
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Informed by broader theoretical frameworks
  - About scientific practice, research infrastructure, collaborative experiences, information commons, etc
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Theory is therefore "grounded" in the data

## Sampling {.smaller}
::: {.fragment}
- Theoretical sampling
  - Sample emerges in response to ongoing theory-building
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Clustered into cases
  - Cases are data harmonization initiatives
  - They constitute sets of collective goals and circumstances that contextualize individuals' responses
  - These circumstances must exhibit overlap and difference to support comparison
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Not generalizable, but representative of prevalent tensions inherent of data sharing
