    "text": "Overview\nThis study investigates the social, technical, administrative and epistemic factors that mediate data-sharing initiatives in epidemiological research. It takes to heart the notions that data are media that facilitate communication across different research contexts, that data are created with specific intent, and that data are bounded by the social, practical and material circumstances of their creation. In light of these facts, I approach data-sharing as means of reconciling the varied circumstances of datasets’ creation — both among themselves, and in relation to contexts of reuse. I therefore frame data-sharing as efforts to foster a series of collaborative ties beyond a project’s original indended scope.\nData harmonization is one means of drawing the observations that constitute data into a formal schema, whose structure is driven by specific objectives and more general underlying suppositions and values. Although schemas are arrived at through discussion, compromise and consensus-building, with an eye toward practical outcomes afforded by the data model, these socially-mediated interactions are generally under-recognized as important factors contributing to data-sharing initiatives’ success relative to their potential impact.\nMy goal is to survey what factors are being priorized within various data harmonization initiatives, the rationales behind these decisions, and the relative efficacy of these variable approaches. More specifically, the project seeks to adress the following research questions:\n\nWhat are the objectives of data-sharing initiatives, how were they established, and what progress has been made to achieve them?\nWhat strategies do data-sharing initiatives employ to ensure they are able to meet their objectives, and how effective are they?\nWhat values underlie these strategies, and can they be linked with effective outcomes?\n\nTo be clear, my intent is not to pit various approaches against each other, but rather to ascertain what actions specific strategies entail, the circumstances in which each is adopted, the value that they bring, and the trade-offs involved. In other words, my goal is to reveal the diverse ways in which data-sharing occurs, and how different approaches impact the outcomes in different ways.",

    "section": "Methodology",
    "text": "Methodology\n\nApproach\nThis study is informed by a set of theoretical and methodological frameworks formed within a more interdisciplinary “science studies” tradition, which contribute to a more sociological outlook on science as cultural practice (cf. Pickering 1992). In practical terms, I will document the social and collaborative experiences involved in various research practices, which ultimately bind the many ways in which scientists do science.\nI will specifically focus on how people contribute to and extract from information commons, which comprise both formal documents and mutually-held and information-laden situated experiences. This involves examining the ways in which participation in disciplinary or even more specialized communities of practice fosters mutual understanding about the potential and limitations pertaining to other people’s data; and how this communally-held knowledge is accessed and re-produced. This approach aligns with the situated cognition methodological framework for examining the improvised, contingent and embodied experiences of human activity, including science (cf. Suchman 2007; Knorr Cetina 2001).\nThe situated cognition framework prioritizes subjects’ outlooks, which are contextualized by their prior experiences, and enables scholars to trace how people make sense of their environments and work with the physical and conceptual tools available to them to resolve immediate challenges. Situated cognition therefore lends itself to investigating rather fluid, open-ended and affect-oriented actions, and is geared towards understanding how actors draw from their prior experiences to navigate unique situations.1\n1 I expand on this in my extended note on efforts to frame the plurality of research experiences as a continuum of practice.Situated cognition is especially salient in explorations of how people who are learning new skills learn how to work in new and possibly unfamiliar ways, and in this sense is closely related to Lave and Wenger’s (1991) theory of situated learning (or ‘communities of practice’ approach), which focuses on how individuals acquire professional skills in relation to their social environments. In such situations, situated cognition enables observers to examine how people align their perspectives as work progresses, and to understand better how people’s general outlooks may have changed under the guidance of more experienced mentors. In other words, situated cognition enables researchers of scientific practices to account for discursive aspects of work, including perceived relationships, distinctions or intersections between practices that professional or research communities deem acceptable and unacceptable, and the cultural or community-driven aspects of decisions that underlie particular actions.\nIn taking on this theoretical framework, I frame epidemiology as a collective endeavour to derive a coherent understanding of population-level health trends, which involves the use of already established knowledge in the validation of newly formed ideas, and which relies on systems designed to carry information obtained with different chains of inference. These systems have both technical and social elements. The technical elements are the means through which information becomes encoded onto information objects so that they may form the basis for further inference. The social elements constitute a series of norms or expectations that facilitate the delegation of roles and responsibilities among agents who contribute their time, effort and accumulated knowledge to communal goals.\nAs such, in constructing the arguments of this study and in carrying out the fieldwork that grounds it, I will rely upon both realist and constructivist viewpoints. In one sense, I rely on documenting how people actually act, including the longer-term and collaborative implications that their actions may have on other work occurring throughout the continuum of practice. To accomplish this, I identify research activities from the perspective of an outside observer. I also ascribe meanings to things (such as physical or conceptual tools, or objects that captivate subjects’ interests) in ways that conform to my own perspective as an investigator of scientific research practices. On the other hand, a constructionist perspective enables me to consider how individual agents make components of information systems suit their needs to facilitate communication or interoperability among actors who hold different situated perspectives. By listening to participants’ views about the systems with which they engage, including explanations as to why they act in the ways that they do, I am able to trace the assumptions and taken-for-granted behaviours that frame their perspectives. Moreover, these insights are useful for developing a better understanding of how participants identify with particular disciplinary communities and their perception of their roles within broader collective efforts.\nUltimately, this study is about the social order of scientific research, i.e. the frameworks, mindsets or sets of values that humans adopt to carry out their work in specific ways. Human beings rely upon physical and conceptual apparatus to do this work but, in order to understand how they do science in ways that conform to the epistemic mandates of the scientific enterprise, it is necessary to prioritize attention to human intention, drivers and pressures. I am emphasizing the agency of human drivers — as opposed to tools and procedures2 — since humans are the ones who (a) identify problems that need to be resolved; (b) imagine, project or predict potential outcomes of various kinds of actions that they may select to resolve the challenges; and (c) learn from prior experiences and change their behaviours accordingly. By highlighting how pragmatic actions are conducted in relation to broader social and discursive trends and tendencies, I consider scholarly practices in terms of potential, certainty and desire from the perspectives of practitioners themselves.\n2 Human and non-human agents are considered on equal footing under the Actor-Network Theory (ANT) framework, which has become very popular since its origins in the late 1980s, but which may not be suitable for this approach. See my extended note on this for further details.\n\nData\nThis project will draw from around 12-15 interviews with epidemiological researchers who lead and carry out initiatives to share and harmonize data. Interviewees will comprise members of several projects that partner with the Maelstrom research group, a service that supports data harmonization efforts in the field of epidemiology. See the case selection strategy document for further information on how cases are decided upon.\nInterviews will be oriented by my goal to document processes of reconciling different stakeholders’ interests as they converge in the formation of a common data stream. Specifically, interviews will focus on motivations for their initiatives, the challenges they experience, how they envision success and failure, their perceptions of their own roles and the roles of other team members and stakeholders, the values that inform their decisions, how the technological apparatus they set up enables them to realize their goals and values, and ways in which they believe data-sharing could be improved. See the interview protocol for further details on the questions I will ask and how their responses will contribute to the project’s findings, as well as logistical considerations.\nI will transcribing the interviews and edit the transcripts so that they conform with transcript notation standards (e.g. GAT-2, see Selting, Auer, and Barth-Weingarten 2011) and so they are optimally formatted for application in qualitative data analysis software. I will use automated speech recognition and natural language processing to create preliminary transcripts, which I will then manual edit.\nI will collect and handle all data in full compliance with the ethics protocol. I will present an overview of the research objectives to all participants and obtain verbal consent prior to each interview before proceeding. Interviewees will be given the option to obfuscate any identifying information in processed records, and I will reiterate this option immediately after the interview and in a follow-up email one week following the interview.\nData will be curated according the data management plan.\n\n\nMethods\nI will perform qualitative data analysis (QDA) methods to highlight collaborative aspects of data harmonization work, as elicited in the interviews. QDA involves encoding the primary sources of evidence in ways that enable a researcher to draw cohesive theoretical accounts or explanations. This is done by tagging segments of a document (such as an interview transcript) using codes, and by embedding open-ended interpretive memos directlly alongside the data. Through these methods, I am able to articulate theories based on empirical evidence that reflect my informants’ diverse experiences.\nCoding — which involves defining what specific elicitations are about in terms that are relevant to the theoretical frameworks that inform my research — entails rendering instances within a text as interpreted abstractions called codes (Charmaz 2014, 43). Codes can exist at various levels of abstraction. For instance, I may apply descriptive codes to characterize literal facets of an instance within a text, and theoretical codes to represent more interpretive concepts that correspond with aspects of particular theoretical frameworks. I tend to create codes on the fly as “open codes” when prompted by encounters with demonstrative instances in the text. However, as I create new codes, I situate them within a hierarchical code system that provides me with a rough taxonomic structure to help organize my work and to enable me to more effectively query the data. Coding in this manner involves synthesis of concepts that speak to my understanding of the phenomena of interest, while forcing me to remain receptive to limits imposed by what is actually contained in the text. In other words, coding involves applying a precise language to segments of transcribed interviews that serve to bridge the gap between what participants said and the theoretical frameworks I apply to explore them as epistemic activities, interfaces and values (cf. Charmaz 2014; Saldaña 2011, 95–98).\nMemoing entails more open-ended exploration and reflection upon latent ideas in order to crystallize them into new avenues to pursue (Charmaz 2014, 72). Constructing memos is a relatively flexible way of engaging with data and serves as fertile ground for honing new ideas. Memoing is especially crucial while articulating sensitizing concepts, which Charmaz (2003, 259) refers to as the “points of departure from which to study the data”. Memoing allows me to take initial notions that lack specification of well-defined attributes, and gradually refine them into more cohesive, definitive concepts (Blumer 1954, 7; Bowen 2006). Exploring the main features, relationships or arrangements that underlie a superficial view of a sensitizing concept through memoing helps me to identify what kinds of things I need to locate in the data in order to gain a full understanding of the phenomena of interest. Memoing is also very important in the process of drawing out more coherent meaning from coded data (cf. Charmaz 2014, 181, 290–93). By creating memos pertaining to the intersections of various codes and drawing comparisons across similarly coded instances, I am able to form more robust and generalizable arguments about the phenomena of interest and relate them to alternative perspectives expressed by others.\nThroughout my analysis, I will follow the approach that Nicolini (2009) and Maryl et al. (2020, para. 30) advocate, who suggest “zooming in to a granular study of particular research activities and operations and zooming out to considering broader sociotechnical and cultural factors.” This involves “magnifying or blowing up the details of practice, switching theoretical lenses, and selective re-positioning so that certain aspects are fore-grounded and others are temporarily sent to the background” (Nicolini 2009, 1412). This approach is useful for me because research projects all start from different positions but share common practices and tendencies that vary according to those contextual circumstances. I am therefore able to tactfully switch between those lenses to understand the interplay between circumstances and practical implementations, which vary across cases, which have their own histories, memberships, sets of tools, methods, and social or political circumstances.ships, sets of tools, methods, and social or political circumstances.\nI will perform all of this work using MaxQDA, a QDA software suite that stores all of these connections within a centralized database (VERBI Software 2021).3 This allows me to retrieve segments of text from across various documents that have been assigned the same sets of codes, and perform more complex queries that search along different parameters of overlap, intersection, and exclusion. I will then be able to query the integrated dataset to produce elaborated accounts of specific kinds of activities, decisions, values and sentiments.\n3 I am most familiar with MaxQDA from my doctoral research. NVivo is another popular proprietary software suite with overlapping functionality, and QualCoder, OpenQDA and QCoder are open source implementations. In my experience, MaxQDA is the most feature-rich option and has a well-crafted interface that suits my needs well.See the QDA protocol for further details on the code system and memoing guidelines, as well as specific QDA procedures.",

    "text": "Last week (2024/12/04) I finally met with David Buckeridge, Tanya Murphy and Aklil Noza in person. The meeting was meant to convey my vision for the project to the whole team, to align perspectives, and to articulate how this will actually work in practice.\nThe gist is that I will be investigating the role of social and cultural factors in data-sharing initiatives such as CITF and other Maelstrom-affiliated projects, and how these relate to, overlap with, or conflict with technical and institutional/administrative factors. To be clear, these are all very important aspects of data-sharing, but we generally recognized that the social and cultural aspects are under-explored relative to their impact.\nWe briefly talked about how we will go about selecting cases, and I emphasized the importance of strategic case selection. This also involves carefully articulating the project’s goals so that the cases will complement them. We agreed that the dataset will likely comprise between 12-15 interviews of around 60-90 minutes in length with representatives from 4-5 cases (one of them being CITF), in addition to representatives of the Maelstrom team. Maelstrom will serve as a “fixed point” that limits the scope of the cases’ breadth and ensures that participants have a common frame of reference. It also potentially allows me to “offload” or “consolidate” reference to technical and administrative aspects of data-sharing through targeted interviews with Maelstrom personnel, instead of dealing with those things with the representatives for each case.\nWe discussed timelines and overlap with Aklil’s work, which will be more concerned with focus groups with CITF databank users. There is definitely overlap with the emphasis of my own work and we will coordinate data collection to enhance the potential for analytical alignment.\nAfter the meeting I chatted with Tanya and Aklil who helped familiarize me with the bigger-picture theoretical discourse and tensions in epidemiology. Much of it seemed familiar since these concerns are common across disciplines, but I still need to read more to concretize my understanding. Tanya recommended I read the “Baby Rothman” which is a condensed version of a very long-lived textbook in this field, among a few other papers she sent me.\nOverall, this meeting got me really excited about this project :)"

    "text": "Key Factors\nTo reiterate, this project investigates the social and collaborative apparatus that scaffold data harmonozation initiatives in epidemiology. Through analysis of data obtained through interviews with various relevant stakeholders attached to data-sharing initiatives, the project will ascertain the actions taken and challenges experienced to mediate the varied motivations, needs and values of those involved. In effect, the project aims to articulate the collaborative commitments that govern the constitution and maintenance of epidemiological information commons, and to relate these to technological, administrative and epistemic factors.\nHere I outline some key factors that will guide the selection of cases so as to ensure that the project meaningfully addressses its goals.\n\n1. Longevity\nInitiatives that have existed for different durations of time will have different capacity to reflect on their practices. Younger projects will not have had as much of a chance to produce any research outcomes, but may be valuable sources for insight on expectations. More established projects will be able to reflect on unexpected challenges they may have experienced.\nIt will be good to have at least one younger project representing an initiative still “in flux”, one or two “legacy” projects (no longer active), and one or two at intermediate stages (extracting data for meaningful analysis, expanding the initiative’s scope, etc)\n\n\n2. Community membership\nThe size and composition of the community, degree of familiarity among its members, and the mechanisms through which connections are managed constitute additional important factors to consider. Communication and decision-making may take different forms when teams are either smaller and locally-concentrated or larger and dispersed. Decision-making may also be significantly impacted by diffferent governance models and degrees of community participation. It would be interesting to identify how leaders are differentiated from other participants, norms and expectations for getting involved in leadership positions, and considerations that are made when making decisions that impact the community.\n\n\n3. Support structures\nData-sharing may be supported by diverse funding models or tech stacks to support the work, which may significantly impact how the work progresses. Comparing sources of support for data-sharing will help me to explore how data-sharing is either integrated into or supplemented as a distinct outgrowth of “normal” science.\nSpecifically, it will be interesting to compare the extent to which projects are left to cobble together their own data-sharing infrastucture, and how this impacts attitudes and norms regarding the curation and nature of research data. I wonder whether lack of government support fosters creative, entrepeneurial, experimental or community-led models, how funding is provided to supporting the development of collaborative research networks, and how these feed back into norms and attitudes regarding the independence of individual research projects and the formation of collectively-maintained information commons.\nI expect a tendency for cases to be supported by limited-term, federally-funded grants, though it might be worth exploring how supplementary funding provided by non-government agencies, including private firms (through MITACS, for instance) and philanthropic organizations (such as the Gates Foundation) impact the work. I would therefore like to included cases funded through these kinds of initiatives in this project.\n\n\n4. Disciplinary trends\nData-sharing is undoubtably impacted by attitudes concerning the nature of data and their roles in scientific knowledge production, and it is therefore necessary to account for different perspectives. Although I am still somewhat unfamiliar with the diversity of thought on such matters in epidemiology, I intuit that much of the open science movement is driven by rather positivist attitude. I would like to include cases that take on alternative approaches to science.\n\n\n5. Historical or contextual factors\nScience is beholden to political trends, which impact ability to obtain funding and collaborate accross borders (e.g. Brexit’s impact on trans-European funding, including initiatives to attract and retain talent). Moreover, certain events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, trigger responses in the scientific community. It may be interesting in exploring how these events affect change in either the short- or long-term.\n\n\n6. Kinds of data\nThe nature of the data will surely impact how they are shared. In epidemiology specifically, there are ethical limitations on sharing precise patient records. This may be especially salient in studies focusing in health in Indiginous populations. Moreover, controls on data collection procedures, including limited or controlled scope or decisions to account for specific factors (such as race, which is prevalent in American datasets but largely ignored elsewhere) may significantly impact what can be done with them when integrated at scale.",

I will rely on structured consultations with the research community to make sense of the data-sharing landscape and select cases accordingly. By consulting with key stakeholders, I will arrive at a consensus about which cases are worth approaching while documenting the rationale behind these selections.\nThe consultation process is meant to ensure that case selection adheres to community will and reasoning, while also ensuring that cases are logistically feasible. I will therefore ask for input from leading members of epidemioligical data-sharing initiatives who are familiar with the goals of the this project, and who are involved with the Maelstrom Project which establishes logistical boundaries around the scope of the project.\n\nFixed cases\nMaelstrom will serve as a “fixed point” that limits the scope of the cases’ breadth, while also ensuring that participants (and myself) have a common frame of reference. This will greatly simplify the interviews by reducing the “overhead” of having to learn or be told about administrative or technical systems, which may distract from the primary themes I seek to address during interviews.\nCITF will also serve as a fixed case. This is partly for logistical reqasons, since the grant is meant to support the CITF Databank, and this project will align with concurrent research on user experiences pertaining to CITF specifically. At the same time, CITF is interesting in its own right and will contribute meaningful insight in comparison with other cases.",

I will prepare a document outlining this project’s objectives and the roles that cases will play in the work. I will also set up a meeting prior to them deciding whether they would like to participate so I can ascertain whether they understand the project and to help determine who may serve as people who can sit for interviews (I expect to hold 12-15 interviews ranging between 60-90 minutes in duration).\nI may prioritize local connections, which provide favourable conditions for holding interviews (i.e., people are more willing to show things that can not be conveyed through a screen, and the pre- and post-interview phases provide meaningful insight). This may introduce bias in that I may obtain more in-depth and nuanced information from local initiatives than those occurring abroad. This can be mitigated by travelling to conduct interviews in person, however the costs of travel may introduce their own biases favouring cases that are easier to reach.",
