This website serves as a hub for my postdoctoral research at McGill University's Covid-19 Immunity Task Force Databank.

The project is concerned with articulating social, collaborative and discursive aspects of epidemiological data-sharing initiatives, and how they relate to, overlap with or conflict with technical, institutional and epistemic factors.

This website hosts a series of preparatory protocols that structure the project, as well as notes about key concepts and reflections on the progress of work.
All content is hosted and tracked at [github.com/zackbatist/CITF-Postdoc](https://github.com/zackbatist/CITF-Postdoc).
