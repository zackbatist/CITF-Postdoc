Dava Göz is one of the few settlements in this area that has been excavated using modern techniques, and has provided new information on the development of the communities in the Lake Urmia basin from the sixth to the fourth millennia BCE (5400–3700/3600 BCE), including the Neolithic/Transitional Chalcolithic (Period IA), the Early Chalcolithic (Dalma = Period IB) and the Late Chalcolithic (Pisdeli = LC1 = Period II; Chaff-Faced Ware horizon = LC2 = Period III) phases. The analysis of the settlement's material culture also enables some preliminary conclusions regarding the interactions between the groups situated north of Lake Urmia and the contemporary Caucasian cultures, as well as with those located farther west and south, in eastern Anatolia and in the Syro-Mesopotamian region. The characterization of 126 artifacts from three periods using a portable XRF machine indicates throughout the phases that changes occurred in procurement activity. In the earlier phases (Transitional Chalcolithic and Dalma), procurement more closely resembles a polysource pattern, dominated by one main obsidian outcrop and complemented by several, less represented sources of that raw material. This pattern however appears to change in the later phase of the site's occupation (LC2/CFW) where a clear domination of one obsidian source is represented. This development could be connected to a disruption in procurement networks and most probably in transhumance patterns as well.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Abedi","given":"A."},{"family":"Varoutsikos","given":"B."},{"family":"Chataigner","given":"C."}],"citation-key":"abedi2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2018.06.022","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,1]]},"page":"756-767","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Provenance of obsidian artifacts from the Chalcolithic site of Dava Göz in NW IRAN using portable XRF","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18302499","volume":"20"},
  {"id":"abuzeid2019","abstract":"In this paper we used an integrated geomatics and geophysical investigation to gain insight about the Upper Pleistocene Cave deposit of Grotta di Fumane, located near to Verona city, Italy. Geophysical techniques are seldom considered for investigation of Paleolithic sites, mostly because as is typical in such a context, the physical properties of archaeological remains do not possess a clear contrast, with respect to the background and because of their tiny size, are difficult to detect As such, the main goals of this combined survey is to reconstruct the volume of the Paleolithic deposit, in terms of visible geometry, sediments distribution and thickness, and map the morphology of the inaccessible karst bedrock that still await to be excavated. These are achieved by using laser scanning and photogrammetry techniques, to create a three-dimensional digital model of the visible portion and using Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) to map the resistivity distribution in the subsurface. Additionally, single station passive seismic measurements were used to provide an indirect confirmation of the sediments thickness by inverting experimental spectral ratio of microtremors. Geophysical results delivered valuable quantitative information about sediments texture spatial distribution highlighting areas of major archaeological interest. Such information guided the 2014–2017 excavations and continuo providing support for long-term planning of future interventions. Finally, the integrated methodology used in this specific context will lead the way for the use of latest technologies to setup a new prospective for enhanced online visualization and virtual reality for the benefits of both cultural and scientific outreach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Abu Zeid","given":"Nasser"},{"family":"Bignardi","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Russo","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Peresani","given":"Marco"}],"citation-key":"abuzeid2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.101976","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"101976","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Deep in a Paleolithic archive: Integrated geophysical investigations and laser-scanner reconstruction at Fumane Cave, Italy","title-short":"Deep in a Paleolithic archive","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X19301968","volume":"27"},

Yet the theoretical literature on the subject, both in archaeology and the philosophy of science, bears very little relationship to what actually occurs in practice. This problem has long interested William Adams, a field archaeologist, and Ernest Adams, a philosopher of science, who describe their book as an ethnography of archaeological classification. It is a study of the various ways in which field archaeologists set about making and using classifications to meet a variety of practical needs. The authors first discuss how humans form concepts. They then describe and analyse in detail a specific example of an archaeological classification, and go on to consider what theoretical generalizations can be derived from the study of actual in-use classifications. Throughout the book, they stress the importance of having a clearly defined purpose and practical procedures when developing and applying classifications.","author":[{"family":"Adams","given":"William Y."},{"family":"Adams","given":"Ernest W."}],"citation-key":"adams2007","ISBN":"978-0-521-04867-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"453","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Archaeological Typology and Practical Reality: A Dialectical Approach to Artifact Classification and Sorting","title-short":"Archaeological Typology and Practical Reality","type":"book"},

  {"id":"adema2021","abstract":"Within the field of open access (OA) publishing, community-led publishing projects are experimenting increasingly with new forms of collaboration and organisation. They do so by focusing on setting up horizontal alliances between independent projects within a certain sector (e.g., scholar-led presses), or vertically across sectors with other not-for-profit organisations (e.g., through collaborations with libraries, universities, and funders), in order to create multi-stakeholder ecologies within scholarly publishing. Yet at the same time, imaginaries for future modes of OA knowledge production are still controlled through demands for ‘scalability’ and ‘sustainability’, which are both seen as preconditions for scholarly communication models and practices to succeed and to be efficient. But they are also prerequi­sites to receive funding for publishing projects or infrastructure development. The scalability of open models is perceived as essential to compete in a landscape dominated by a handful of major corporate players.Drawing on our work with the Radical Open Access Collective, the ScholarLed consortium, and the Community-led Open Publishing Infrastructures for Mono­graphs (COPIM) project, this article outlines an alternative organisational prin­ciple for governing community-led publishing projects based on mutual reliance, care, and other forms of commoning. Termed ‘scaling small’, this principle eschews standard approaches to organisational growth that tend to flatten community diversity through economies of scale. Instead, it puts forward the idea that scale can be nurtured through intentional collaborations between community-driven pro­jects that promote a bibliodiverse ecosystem while providing resilience through resource sharing and other kinds of collaboration. Following Anna Tsing’s recom­mendations to keep in mind how reimagining our knowledge practices requires we pay particular attention to articulations between the scalable and the nonscalable (Tsing, 2012), what is needed to enable this is, first and foremost, a rethinking of existing systems and infrastructures and how they currently function – systems that have historically developed and been continuously remade to encourage fur­ther scalability. We further explore the possibilities of scaling small with particular reference to Anna Tsing’s work on the ‘latent commons’ and Massimo De Angelis’ discussion of ‘boundary commoning’, examining how these concepts are on display within the Radical Open Access Collective, ScholarLed and the COPIM project. As we will argue, reimagining the relations within publishing beyond a mere calcula­tive logic, i.e., one that is focused on assessing the sustainability of alternative models, is essential in not-for-profit OA publishing environments, particularly if we want new forms of collaboration to arise and to redefine the future of scholarly publishing in communal settings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Adema","given":"Janneke"},{"family":"Moore","given":"Samuel"}],"citation-key":"adema2021","container-title":"Westminster Papers in Communication and Culture","DOI":"10.16997/wpcc.918","ISSN":"1744-6716","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,23]]},"page":"27-45","source":"Coventry University","title":"Scaling Small; Or How to Envision New Relationalities for Knowledge Production","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?scp=85104600013&partnerID=8YFLogxK","volume":"16"},

Do our academic assessment systems reward scholarship that addresses the questions that matter most to society? Using international business as an example, we highlight the problematic nature of academic ranking systems and question if such assessments are drawing scholarship away from its fundamental purpose. We call for an immediate examination of existing ranking systems, not only as a legitimate scholarly question vis-a-vis performance—a conceptual lens with deep roots in management research—but also because the very health and vibrancy of the field are at stake. Indeed, in light of the data presented here, which suggest that current systems are dysfunctional and potentially cause more harm than good, a temporary moratorium on rankings may be appropriate until more valid and reliable ways to assess scholarly contributions can be developed. The worldwide community of scholars, along with the global network of institutions interacting with and supporting management scholarship (such as the Academy of Management, AACSB, and Thomson Reuters Scientific) are invited to innovate and design more reliable and valid ways to assess scholarly contributions that truly promote the advancement of relevant 21st century knowledge, and likewise recognize those individuals and institutions that best fulfill the university's fundamental purpose.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Adler","given":"Nancy J."},{"family":"Harzing","given":"Anne-Wil"}],"citation-key":"adler2009","container-title":"Academy of Management Learning & Education","container-title-short":"AMLE","DOI":"10.5465/amle.2009.37012181","ISSN":"1537-260X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",3,1]]},"page":"72-95","source":"journals.aom.org (Atypon)","title":"When Knowledge Wins: Transcending the Sense and Nonsense of Academic Rankings","title-short":"When Knowledge Wins","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/AMLE.2009.37012181","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"aitchison2000","abstract":"Professional archaeology in England is funded from a variety of sources. This chapter of Cultural Trends presents research tracing the route by which this has developed, examining and quantifying the sources of funding for professional archaeological practice in 2000. This is the first study to quantify archaeological funding from all sources in the last decade. Since 1990, governmental planning advice has switched the financial burden of recording archaeological remains from the state to private sources. This has allowed a great expansion of archaeological work to take place, through the requirements of the planning system, and funded from private sources. While central government funding has remained static (falling in real terms) over the last decade, private ‐ developer ‐ funding has become the norm. It is calculated that approximately £120 million was spent on professional archaeological practice in 2000, with over half of that sum coming from private sources. This chapter examines and quantifies all the sources of funding for professional archaeology, considering developer funding in detail. Undoubtedly the expansion of developer funding has brought great benefits to professional archaeology, not least in terms of the greater scale of work required, but it has also raised problems, allowing archaeological practice in 2000 to become a weakly regulated, market‐led activity. Local government, as the regulator of the planning system, has a key role to play. As archaeological services in local government are not maintained on a statutory basis, they are open to budgetary pressures. The chapter concludes by examining the key issues relating to development and archaeology in the near future, and suggests an alternative approach to funding that might better suit developers, planners and archaeologists alike.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Aitchison","given":"Kenneth"}],"citation-key":"aitchison2000","container-title":"Cultural Trends","DOI":"10.1080/09548960009365127","ISSN":"0954-8963","issue":"39","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",1,1]]},"page":"1-32","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The funding of professional archaeological practice in England","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09548960009365127","volume":"10"},

Efforts to develop these resources may benefit from a greater understanding of disciplinary differences in research data management needs. After conducting a survey of data management practices and perspectives at our research university, we categorized faculty members into four research domains—arts and humanities, social sciences, medical sciences, and basic sciences—and analyzed variations in their patterns of survey responses. We found statistically significant differences among the four research domains for nearly every survey item, revealing important disciplinary distinctions in data management actions, attitudes, and interest in support services. Serious consideration of both the similarities and dissimilarities among disciplines will help guide academic librarians and other data curation professionals in developing a range of data-management services that can be tailored to the unique needs of different scholarly researchers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Akers","given":"Katherine G."},{"family":"Doty","given":"Jennifer"}],"citation-key":"akers2013","container-title":"International Journal of Digital Curation","DOI":"10.2218/ijdc.v8i2.263","ISSN":"1746-8256","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",11,19]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c)","page":"5-26","source":"www.ijdc.net","title":"Disciplinary differences in faculty research data management practices and perspectives","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/view/8.2.5","volume":"8"},

However, as Lo and Mueller (2010) state “Blaming quantitative models for the crisis seems particularly perverse, and akin to blaming arithmetic and the real number system for accounting fraud.” Throughout the history, mathematics and finance have always been in a close relationship. Starting from Babylonians, through Thales, and then Fibonacci, Pascal, Fermat, Bernoulli, Bachelier, Wiener, Kolmogorov, Ito, Markowitz, Black, Scholes, Merton and many others made huge contributions to the development of mathematics while trying to solve finance problems. In this paper, we present a brief historical perspective on how the development of finance theory has influenced and in turn been influenced by the development of mathematical finance theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Akyıldırım","given":"Erdinç"},{"family":"Soner","given":"Halil Mete"}],"citation-key":"akyildirim2014","container-title":"Borsa Istanbul Review","container-title-short":"Borsa Istanbul Review","DOI":"10.1016/j.bir.2014.01.002","ISSN":"2214-8450","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,1]]},"page":"57-63","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A brief history of mathematics in finance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214845014000039","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"alberti2011","abstract":"The debate concerning ontology is heating up in the social sciences. How is this impacting anthropology and archaeology? What contributions can these disciplines make? Following a session at the 2010 Theoretical Archaeology Group conference at Brown University (“‘Worlds Otherwise’: Archaeology, Theory, and Ontological Difference,” convened by Ben Alberti and Yvonne Marshall), a group of archaeologists and anthropologists have continued to discuss the merits, possibilities, and problems of an ontologically oriented approach. The current paper is a portion of this larger conversation—a format we maintain here because, among other things, it permits a welcome level of candor and simplicity. In this forum we present two questions (written by Alberti and Witmore, along with the concluding comments) and the responses of five of the Theoretical Archaeology Group session participants. The first question asks why we think an ontological approach is important to our respective fields; the second, building upon the first set of responses, asks authors to consider the difference that pluralizing ontology might make and whether such a move is desirable given the aims of archaeology and anthropology. While several angles on ontology come through in the conversation, all share an interest in more immanent understandings that arise within specific situations and that are perhaps best described as thoroughly entangled rather than transcendent and/or oppositional in any straightforward sense.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Alberti","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Fowles","given":"Severin"},{"family":"Holbraad","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Marshall","given":"Yvonne"},{"family":"Witmore","given":"Christopher"}],"citation-key":"alberti2011","container-title":"Current Anthropology","container-title-short":"Current Anthropology","DOI":"10.1086/662027","ISSN":"0011-3204","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",12,1]]},"page":"896-912","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"“Worlds Otherwise”: Archaeology, Anthropology, and Ontological Difference","title-short":"“Worlds Otherwise”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/662027","volume":"52"},

  {"id":"aldin2011","abstract":"Business process modelling (BPM) has become fundamental for modern enterprises due to the increasing rate of organisational change. As a consequence, business processes need to be continuously (re-)designed as well as subsequently aligned with the corresponding enterprise information systems. One major problem associated with the design of business processes is reusability. Reuse of business process models has the potential of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of BPM. This article critically surveys the existing literature on the problem of BPM reusability and more specifically on that State-of-the-Art research that can provide or suggest the ‘elements’ required for the development of a methodology aimed at discovering reusable conceptual artefacts in the form of patterns. The article initially clarifies the definitions of business process and business process model; then, it sets out to explore the previous research conducted in areas that have an impact on reusability in BPM. The article concludes by distilling directions for future research towards the development of apatterns-based approach to BPM; an approach that brings together the contributions made by the research community in the areas of process mining and discovery, declarative approaches and ontologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Aldin","given":"Laden"},{"family":"Cesare","given":"Sergio","dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"aldin2011","container-title":"Enterprise Information Systems","DOI":"10.1080/17517575.2011.557443","ISSN":"1751-7575","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",8,1]]},"page":"359-383","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"A literature review on business process modelling: new frontiers of reusability","title-short":"A literature review on business process modelling","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17517575.2011.557443","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"alexander1977","abstract":"You can use this book to design a house for yourself with your family; you can use it to work with your neighbors to improve your town and neighborhood; you can use it to design an office, or a workshop, or a public building. And you can use it to guide you in the actual process of construction. After a ten-year silence, Christopher Alexander and his colleagues at the Center for Environmental Structure are now publishing a major statement in the form of three books which will, in their words, \"lay the basis for an entirely new approach to architecture, building and planning, which will we hope replace existing ideas and practices entirely.\" The three books are The Timeless Way of Building, The Oregon Experiment, and this book, A Pattern Language. At the core of these books is the idea that people should design for themselves their own houses, streets, and communities. This idea may be radical (it implies a radical transformation of the architectural profession) but it comes simply from the observation that most of the wonderful places of the world were not made by architects but by the people. At the core of the books, too, is the point that in designing their environments people always rely on certain \"languages,\" which, like the languages we speak, allow them to articulate and communicate an infinite variety of designs within a forma system which gives them coherence. This book provides a language of this kind. It will enable a person to make a design for almost any kind of building, or any part of the built environment. \"Patterns,\" the units of this language, are answers to design problems (How high should a window sill be? How many stories should a building have? How much space in a neighborhood should be devoted to grass and trees?). More than 250 of the patterns in this pattern language are given: each consists of a problem statement, a discussion of the problem with an illustration, and a solution. As the authors say in their introduction, many of the patterns are archetypal, so deeply rooted in the nature of things that it seemly likely that they will be a part of human nature, and human action, as much in five hundred years as they are today.","author":[{"family":"Alexander","given":"Christopher"}],"citation-key":"alexander1977","event-place":"Oxford","ISBN":"978-0-19-972653-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["1977",8,25]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"1216","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford","source":"Google Books","title":"A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction","title-short":"A Pattern Language","type":"book"},

  {"id":"allen2019a","abstract":"The movement towards open science is a consequence of seemingly pervasive failures to replicate previous research. This transition comes with great benefits but also significant challenges that are likely to affect those who carry out the research, usually early career researchers (ECRs). Here, we describe key benefits, including reputational gains, increased chances of publication, and a broader increase in the reliability of research. The increased chances of publication are supported by exploratory analyses indicating null findings are substantially more likely to be published via open registered reports in comparison to more conventional methods. These benefits are balanced by challenges that we have encountered and that involve increased costs in terms of flexibility, time, and issues with the current incentive structure, all of which seem to affect ECRs acutely. Although there are major obstacles to the early adoption of open science, overall open science practices should benefit both the ECR and improve the quality of research. We review 3 benefits and 3 challenges and provide suggestions from the perspective of ECRs for moving towards open science practices, which we believe scientists and institutions at all levels would do well to consider.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Allen","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Mehler","given":"David M.

  {"id":"allentuck2019","abstract":"The climate record of the Mid-Holocene southern Levant indicates a period of rapid climate change and erratic rainfall. An unpredictable rainfall regime would have posed a considerable risk to societies dependent upon crops and livestock that require a plentiful and consistent supply of water. In this paper, we first examine an assemblage of pig remains from Hartuv, a small settlement occupied during the Early Bronze Age, and then interpret these data alongside palaeohydrological evidence. We reconcile seemingly contradictory data—high relative taxonomic abundance of pigs and climatic conditions characterized by a general aridification trend and rainfall instability—by considering zooarchaeological assemblages from nearby sites in the context of their hydrological settings. On the basis of geoarchaeological evidence from Hartuv, we conclude that the effects of variable rainfall were mitigated by a locally marshy environment and an anthropogenic landscape feature, which may have been used to store water.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Allentuck","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Rosen","given":"Arlene M."}],"citation-key":"allentuck2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.03.009","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"page":"939-945","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The risky business of keeping pigs during periods of climatic fluctuation: A case from the Mid-Holocene Near East","title-short":"The risky business of keeping pigs during periods of climatic fluctuation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18305145","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"almeida-warren2021","abstract":"Spatial information is crucial to archaeological field research. From the plane-table to the total station, recent technological advances have enabled data collection to become fully digital and highly accurate. Nevertheless, the recent expansion of archaeological expeditions to novel environments often incompatible with modern mapping equipment, e.g. tropical forests or ephemeral shorelines, calls for further methodological innovations. Such projects, as well as those under logistic or financial limitations, are still largely reliant on more time consuming, less accurate, traditional approaches, e.g. offset or tape and compass methods. The DistoX2 is a digital, highly portable, and versatile hand-held instrument originally developed for speleological surveys where total stations and DGPSs are not feasible. However, the potential of the DistoX2 system as a spatial mapping tool in above-ground contexts has been surprisingly overlooked. Here, we present a first assessment of the applicability of the DistoX2 for archaeological mapping in non-speleological environments. We investigate precision and accuracy in controlled above-ground settings relative to two common methods of data collection – total station, and tape and compass. We test the relative precision of the DistoX2 when mounted on a tripod or operated in hand-held mode and discuss its applicability, and potential combined used, in the context of other increasingly popular methods – GNSS and SfM photogrammetry. With a mean error of ≈5.00 cm for horizontal readings and ≈2.00 cm for vertical readings, the DistoX2 is considerably more accurate than the tape and compass method (µ ≈ 67.00 cm horizontal; µ ≈ 3.00 cm vertical). While the DistoX2 exceeds the error thresholds of projects that require high spatial sensitivity (e.g. Palaeolithic excavations), it provides a reliable, low-cost and more accurate alternative to many projects that resort to more traditional methods. This fills an existent methodological and financial gap amongst the growing diversity of archaeological expeditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Almeida-Warren","given":"Katarina"},{"family":"Braun","given":"David R."},{"family":"Carvalho","given":"Susana"}],"citation-key":"almeida-warren2021","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2020.102688","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"102688","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The DistoX2: A methodological solution to archaeological mapping in poorly accessible environments","title-short":"The DistoX2","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X2030479X","volume":"35"},

Methods deployed include point pattern analysis of stone concentrations and a machine-learning technique using unsupervised classification of visible stone signature qualities, which are used in simple linear regressions to compare with geophysical and ceramic surface survey results of a site in Iraqi Kurdistan. There is a stronger fit (r2 = 0.77) between surface stone concentrations and architecture identified by geophysical measurement, while surveyed ceramics show a weaker fit to defined architecture (r2 = 0.31). Surface stone concentrations are potentially a better proxy than ceramics for determining the presence of past settlement in regions where stone was commonly used, sites are relatively flat, and ceramics are found in low concentrations. The methods advanced here can be scaled to wider areas, particularly in mountainous regions, where surface stone features are present.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Altaweel","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Squitieri","given":"Andrea"}],"citation-key":"altaweel2019","container-title":"Journal of Field Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00934690.2019.1662269","ISSN":"0093-4690","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,26]]},"page":"1-15","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Finding a Relatively Flat Archaeological Site with Minimal Ceramics: A Case Study from Iraqi Kurdistan","title-short":"Finding a Relatively Flat Archaeological Site with Minimal Ceramics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00934690.2019.1662269","volume":"0"},

  {"id":"altschul2018","abstract":"While our fascination with understanding the past is sufficient to warrant an increased focus on synthesis, solutions to important problems facing modern society require understandings based on data that only archaeology can provide. Yet, even as we use public monies to collect ever-greater amounts of data, modes of research that can stimulate emergent understandings of human behavior have lagged behind. Consequently, a substantial amount of archaeological inference remains at the level of the individual project. We can more effectively leverage these data and advance our understandings of the past in ways that contribute to solutions to contemporary problems if we adapt the model pioneered by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis to foster synthetic collaborative research in archaeology. We propose the creation of the Coalition for Archaeological Synthesis coordinated through a U.S.-based National Center for Archaeological Synthesis. The coalition will be composed of established public and private organizations that provide essential scholarly, cultural heritage, computational, educational, and public engagement infrastructure. The center would seek and administer funding to support collaborative analysis and synthesis projects executed through coalition partners. This innovative structure will enable the discipline to address key challenges facing society through evidentially based, collaborative synthetic research.\n, \nSi bien nuestra fascinación por entender el pasado es suficiente justificación para garantizar un mayor enfoque en la síntesis, las soluciones a los problemas importantes que enfrenta la sociedad moderna requieren de conocimientos basados en datos que sólo la arqueología puede proporcionar. Aunque usamos el dinero público para recolectar cantidades cada vez mayores de datos, las distintas formas de investigación que pueden estimular conocimientos emergentes en torno al comportamiento humano han quedado rezagadas. Consecuentemente, la inferencia arqueológica, en gran medida, se queda en el proyecto individual. Podemos aprovechar más eficazmente estos datos y avanzar en nuestros conocimientos en torno al pasado de forma tal que contribuyamos a la solución de problemas contemporáneos si adaptamos el modelo pionero del “Centro Nacional para el Análisis Ecológico y la Síntesis” para fomentar la investigación colaborativa para sintetizar la información arqueológica. Proponemos la creación de la “Coalición para la Síntesis Arqueológica”, coordinada a través de un “Centro Nacional para la Síntesis Arqueológica,” en los Estados Unidos. La “Coalición” estará compuesta de organizaciones públicas y privadas establecidas, entidades que proporcionarán la infraestructura esencial académica, cultural, computacional, educativa y de participación pública. El “Centro” buscaría y administraría los fondos para apoyar tanto el análisis colaborativo y los proyectos sintéticos, implementado a través de los socios de la Coalición.

  {"id":"alvarezlarrain2019","abstract":"This article presents participatory mapping (PM) and Participatory Geographical Information Systems (PGIS) approaches as an appropriate and still developing kind of community-based spatial study in archaeology. Researchers and practitioners who advocate reflexive mapping practices in the field recognize that mapping is not an objective practice and that maps are necessarily the product of those who create them. We consider that a PM/PGIS approach can contribute to this reflexive practice through the incorporation of local spatial knowledge (LSK) which is always place-based and reflects a long and close physical interaction with the landscape. For local communities, this approach helps them to be incorporated as active subjects in the registration and interpretation of their cultural heritage, as well as in the defense and management of it. At the same time, archaeological studies are enriched by incorporating contemporary perspectives and local people’s knowledge into interpretations of past landscapes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Álvarez Larrain","given":"Alina"},{"family":"McCall","given":"Michael K."}],"citation-key":"alvarezlarrain2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-018-9385-z","ISSN":"1573-7764","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"643-678","source":"Springer Link","title":"Participatory Mapping and Participatory GIS for Historical and Archaeological Landscape Studies: a Critical Review","title-short":"Participatory Mapping and Participatory GIS for Historical and Archaeological Landscape Studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-018-9385-z","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"amati2018","abstract":"Model-based reconstruction is an approach to infer network structures where they cannot be observed. For archaeological networks, several models based on assumptions concerning distance among sites, site size, or costs and benefits have been proposed to infer missing ties. Since these assumptions are formulated at a dyadic level, they do not provide means to express dependencies among ties and therefore include less plausible network scenarios. In this paper we investigate the use of network models that explicitly incorporate tie dependence. In particular, we consider exponential random graph models, and show how they can be applied to reconstruct networks coherent with Burt's arguments on closure and structural holes (Burt 2001). The approach is illustrated on data from the Middle Bronze Age in the Aegean.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Amati","given":"Viviana"},{"family":"Shafie","given":"Termeh"},{"family":"Brandes","given":"Ulrik"}],"citation-key":"amati2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-017-9335-1","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"226-253","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Reconstructing Archaeological Networks with Structural Holes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-017-9335-1","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"andersen2020","abstract":"We argue that the stakes of scholarly communication are changing as a result of technology-enabled ability to self-track and the enhanced provision and proliferation of instant metrics. These developments accentuate the role of the individual, and conversely underplay the collective effort, in the advancement of knowledge by focusing attention on metrics centered on the individual, professional performance, and communication directed at oneself. We suggest – in line with previous research – that metrics play an increasingly important role in configuring the scholarly communication system. But we also stress, unlike previous research, that metrics are embedded in larger communication contexts, or systems, that are already codified and ordered. Hence the discursive value ascribed to metrics must take into account these contexts. This has at least two benefits. One, we do not reduce scholarly communication to an issue of metrics and rewards, like scientometric studies and contemporary notions of the so-called quantified academic self, and two, a communication framework allows us to see new sorts of conversations going on and new modes of togetherness enabled alongside the digital nurturing of metric regimes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Andersen","given":"Jack"},{"family":"Lomborg","given":"Stine"}],"citation-key":"andersen2020","container-title":"The Information Society","DOI":"10.1080/01972243.2019.1685039","ISSN":"0197-2243","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,1]]},"page":"43-52","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Self-tracking and metric codification in digital infrastructures for scholarly communication","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01972243.2019.1685039","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"anderson2019","abstract":"After World War II the research film increasingly became instrumental in medical science and cultural anthropology, especially in the recording and analysis of non-recurring events in isolated or “primitive” communities. Ambitiously, Carleton Gajdusek and Richard Sorenson in the 1960s sought to accumulate a global film archive of such communities, focusing on clinical disorders, such as kuru among the Fore people of New Guinea, and patterns of child health and development. Ostensibly objective, and certainly distancing, the camera also was for them a desiring machine, thus relating their archival project to the contemporary experimental films of Warhol in New York. Comparison with associated documentary film, with its emphasis on editorial selection, thematic coherence and narrative closure, reveals differences in how filmic investigators engage with their subjects, as well as discordances in valuation and ethics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Warwick"}],"citation-key":"anderson2019","container-title":"Visual Anthropology","DOI":"10.1080/08949468.2019.1603032","ISSN":"0894-9468","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,15]]},"page":"109-127","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Filming Fore, Shooting Scientists: Medical Research, Experimental Filmmaking, and Documentary Cinema","title-short":"Filming Fore, Shooting Scientists","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/08949468.2019.1603032","volume":"32"},

Our framework foregrounds vibrant things as opposed to static objects, and sympathetically articulates the current concepts of entanglement, correspondence and assemblage. To us an assemblage of practice is a dynamic gathering of corresponding things entangled through situated daily and eventful human practice. Once reassembled by comprehensively and critically marshalling all the evidentiary lines available to archaeologists today, the assemblage of practice becomes a powerful analytical tool that illuminates changes, continuities and transformations in human–thing entanglements, and not only their impacts on local and short-term sociocultural developments, but also their repercussions on phenomena of much larger spatiotemporal scale. Our goal is to present archaeologists with a pluralistic, integrative and evolving middle-range framework that pays close attention to terminological precision and theoretical clarity and is conceptually accessible and widely applicable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Antczak","given":"Konrad A."},{"family":"Beaudry","given":"Mary C."}],"citation-key":"antczak2019","container-title":"Archaeological Dialogues","DOI":"10.1017/s1380203819000205","ISSN":"1380-2038, 1478-2294","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12]]},"language":"en","page":"87-110","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Assemblages of practice.

The goal of this paper therefore is to test the different known methods and to define the obtained differences, in order to make the density values (remains per litre of sediment) for plant macroremains in the samples comparable between sites. Three methods of volume measurement were tested for a large number of samples of different sizes coming from two late Neolithic layers of the lakeshore site of Parkhaus Opéra (Zürich, Switzerland). The sampled layers were preserved in waterlogged conditions and there were samples rich in sand, loam, lake marl but mostly consisting of organic remains, including uncharred subfossil plant macroremains. In general, the classical volume (that is the upper limit of the sediment in water) measured before and after freezing as pre-treatment gave similar results. But a systematic difference was found between the classical volume measured after freezing and the displacement volume. This difference could be described by a proportionality factor of 1.5. This proportionality factor could be used to make data obtained with different methods of volume measurement comparable, although more evaluations are needed from other sites in order to test the generality of the factor proposed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Antolín","given":"Ferran"},{"family":"Steiner","given":"Bigna L."},{"family":"Vach","given":"Werner"},{"family":"Jacomet","given":"Stefanie"}],"citation-key":"antolin2015","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2015.04.019","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,1]]},"page":"36-44","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"What is a litre of sediment?

From these shared datasets we demonstrate that the westward expansion of Neolithic subsistence technologies combined multiple routes and pulses but did not involve a set ‘package’ comprising all four livestock species including sheep, goat, cattle and pig. Instead, Neolithic animal economies in the study regions are shown to be more diverse than deduced previously using quantitatively more limited datasets. Moreover, during the transition to agro-pastoral economies interactions between domestic stock and local wild fauna continued.

In this chapter, the author offers a broad survey of a multi-faceted topic based in part on a literature review, a specially convened seminar, and also his own experience making exhibitions at the Wellcome Collection in London. After reviewing a range of developments driving a change in the way curators work – expansion of the museum profession, new museum spaces and places, and different ways of thinking about collections and exhibitions, research and scholarship, media and audience – he argues that new forms, models, and approaches are appearing: broadly speaking a shift from caring to creating. In this “new curatorship” we see curators as political activists, artistic directors, and public investigators. However, sometimes the skills involved are the same as they have always been, for example the kind of “thinking out loud” found in the exhibition experiments of the new interdisciplinary cultural centers of which the Wellcome Collection is an example. In this particular form of new curatorship, the chapter concludes, a premium is placed on the idea of seeking and marshalling visual and material ideas in order finally, with an inspired flourish of showmanship, to just stand back and point.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Arnold","given":"Ken"}],"citation-key":"arnold2015","container-title":"The International Handbooks of Museum Studies","DOI":"10.1002/9781118829059.wbihms214","ISBN":"978-1-118-82905-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"English","page":"317–339","publisher":"American Cancer Society","section":"14","title":"From Caring to Creating: Curators Change Their Spots","title-short":"From Caring to Creating","type":"chapter","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118829059.wbihms214"},

This paper is theoretical in character, attempting, for the benefit of drawing up research designs, to understand and evaluate the character of environmental determinism. We reach three main conclusions: (1) in a typical pattern of research design, studies seek to detect simultaneous shifts in the environmental and archaeological records, variously positing the former to have influenced, triggered or caused the latter; (2) the question of determinism involves uncertainty about the justification for the above research design in particular in what comes to biologism and the concept of environmental thresholds on the one hand and the externality of the drivers of transformation in human groups and societies on the other; (3) adapting the concepts of the social production of vulnerability and the social basis of hazards from anthropology may help to clarify the available research design choices at hand.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Arponen","given":"V.

Life histories of place receive special attention as ways of discerning the existence and social impact of such decisions and dispositions. These life histories constitute an arena in which archaeologists from diverse theoretical perspectives can offer complementary insights.

Why do we set up ARIADNE (Advanced Research Infrastructure for Archaeological Dataset Networking in Europe), and what will the archaeological research community gain from it? What are the challenges of the project and how are we going about to solve them?\nResearch infrastructures are facilities, resources and related services used by the scientific community to conduct research. In archaeology, digital research infrastructures exist in several European countries providing access to data from diverse areas including for example archaeological sites, images and scientific measurements.\nWithin the EU FP7 project ARIADNE (www.ariadne-infrastructure.eu) a virtual data infrastructure will be set up integrating archaeological datasets distributed across European institutions. Existing datasets will be made accessible for use (re-)use trans-nationally via new web-based services through a common interface.\nThe aim of ARIADNE is to develop useful research services and to facilitate collaboration among archaeological research groups in Europe and beyond. Best practice in ICT-enhanced methodologies in archaeology will be identified and shared. ARIADNE will also be connected to related European initiatives, e.g. the Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities (DARIAH).\nMaking datasets accessible, e.g. search across institutions and research domains, poses technical and conceptual challenge. Data are held in many different forms and in a number of languages. Therefore technical problems have to be solved to allow communication at machine level, and semantic interoperability has to be achieved based on unambiguous definition of archaeological concepts.\nMoreover, commitment to a culture of data sharing is necessary, including to make data available, but also to be able to rely on data provided by others.","author":[{"family":"Aspöck","given":"Edeltraud"},{"family":"Geser","given":"Guntram"}],"citation-key":"aspock2014","container-title":"18th International Conference on Cultural Heritage and New Technologies.

  {"id":"astrom2019","abstract":"Remains of the Roman empire are numerous and spread out all around the Mediterranean sea, including north Africa, central Europe and all the way to Great Britain. Through out this area there are a vast number of Roman mosaics preserved to modern day, which among other things illustrates figurative motifs. As often noted before, the sophistication that characterizes these figurative motifs is quite remarkable. These motifs have been in the focus of a large amount of research articles and projects for quite some years. In addition to these figurative motifs there are geometrical motifs and patterns paved in the mosaics. These geometrical patterns have not to the same extent been analysed. On the contrary, they have often been neglected, with some exceptions. One type of geometrical patterns is interlaced patterns often used as borders and frames in the mosaics. These have in an even larger extent been neglected in the studies of Roman mosaics, in fact, analyses are rather rare. The illustrations of interlaced patterns in the Roman mosaics is an important part of the historical development and use of knots, links and knotworks as decorative patterns. A fair amount of these knotworks are based on rather simple mathematical principles. We provide an overview of the current research on geometrical patterns and give an introductory analysis of interlaced patterns in the Roman mosaics using a mathematical approach. Such an approach gives us a formalized classification scheme and a unified terminology for knots and links, regardless of medium, thus it is possible to further extend the analysis to other media than mosaics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Åström","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Åström","given":"Christoffer"}],"citation-key":"astrom2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.102013","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"102013","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A mathematical approach to the analysis of interlaced patterns in Roman mosaic","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X19303062","volume":"28"},

We report archaeological and radiocarbon data from Alamagan, a small and isolated island in the northern part of the Mariana Islands archipelago. Challenging environmental conditions, including rugged terrain, active or recent volcanism, and uncertain freshwater availability posed significant challenges for permanent settlement throughout the Northern Islands. The Alamagan archaeological investigations documented 14 megalithic domestic structures, or latte sets, as well as isolated and non-portable Latte Period artifacts, and one historical site. Test excavations were undertaken at two of the latte features. These investigations add to a growing body of data suggesting colonization of the Northern Islands during the middle part of the Latte Period (probably during the late a.d. 1200s or early 1300s).

  {"id":"austin2014","abstract":"Data collection takes up much of the already limited time archaeologists have to excavate and often requires additional time to digitize. Moreover, despite efforts to standardize data, archaeologists often find errors such as blank or incorrectly recorded fields. To avoid these issues, several projects have made use of tablet computers to streamline and digitize data, but this process can be opaque, specialized, and expensive. Previous research has addressed neither the general feasibility of developing and utilizing mobile devices for data collection nor the quality and quantity of these data. In this article, I review existing methods and practices for integrating data collection on mobile devices in order to evaluate the costs and feasibility of transitioning to a mobile-based data collection system. Through a case study using OsteoSurvey, a series of bioarchaeological data collection forms for Android tablets, I assess the efficacy of data collection on mobile devices. An experiment comparing OsteoSurvey to traditional paper forms demonstrates that participants saved time and made fewer mistakes using the OsteoSurvey forms, resulting in the collection of 21–32 percent more data. Consequently, data collection with mobile devices can significantly increase the overall productivity and quality of archaeological research\n, \nLa recolección de datos ocupa una gran parte del poco tiempo que los arqueólogos tienen para excavar, y muchas veces es necesario perder aún más tiempo para digitalizar estos datos. Además, a pesar de los esfuerzos para normalizar los datos, los arqueólogos suelen encontrar errores como espacios en blanco o datos incorrectamente registrados. Varios proyectos han integrado computadores personales de forma tablet para evitar estos problemas mediante la racionalización y la digitalización de los datos, pero este proceso puede ser poco claro, especializado y costoso. Investigaciones previas no se han enfocado en la viabilidad del desarrollo y la utilización de dispositivos móviles para la recolección de datos ni la calidad o cantidad de los mismos. En este estudio, se revisan los métodos y las prácticas existentes para la integración de la recopilación de datos en los dispositivos móviles con el fin de evaluar los costos y la viabilidad de la transición a un sistema de recolección de datos en dispositivos móviles. A través de un caso de estudio sobre la OsteoSurvey—una serie de formularios en tablets Android de recolección de datos bioarqueológicos—se evalúa la eficacia de la recolección de datos en dispositivos móviles. Un experimento que compara la OsteoSurvey con los formularios tradicionales en papel demuestra que los participantes se demoraron menos tiempo y cometieron menos errores en la OsteoSurvey que en los formularios en papel, lo que resulta en la recolección de entre el 21 al 32 por ciento más de datos. En consecuencia, la recopilación de datos con los dispositivos móviles puede aumentar significativamente la productividad y la calidad de la investigación arqueológica.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Austin","given":"Anne"}],"citation-key":"austin2014","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.7183/2326-3768.2.1.13","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",2]]},"language":"en","page":"13-23","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Mobilizing Archaeologists: Increasing the Quantity and Quality of Data Collected in the Field with Mobile Technology","title-short":"Mobilizing Archaeologists","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/mobilizing-archaeologists/E3A188762E2ED9336BE491F667B56811","volume":"2"},
  {"id":"austin2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            Archaeologists frequently use written guidelines such as site manuals, recording forms, and digital prompts during excavations to create usable data within and across projects. Most written guidelines emphasize creating either standardized datasets or narrative summaries; however, previous research has demonstrated that the resulting datasets are often difficult to (re)use. Our study analyzed observations and interviews conducted with four archaeological excavation teams, as well as interviews with archaeological data reusers, to evaluate how archaeologists use and implement written guidelines. These excavation team and reuser experiences suggest that archaeologists need more specific best practices to create and implement written guidelines that improve the quality and usability of archaeological data. We present recommendations to improve written guidelines that focus on a project's methods, end-of-season documentation, and naming practices. We also present a Written Guidelines Checklist to help project directors improve their written guidelines before, during, and after fieldwork as part of a collaborative process. Ideally, these best practices for written guidelines will make it easier for team members and future reusers to incorporate their own and others’ archaeological data into their research.\n          , \n            Los arqueólogos utilizan con frecuencia pautas escritas como manuales de sitio, formularios de registro y pautas digitales durante las excavaciones para crear datos utilizables dentro y entre proyectos.

Este estudio analiza observaciones y entrevistas realizadas a cuatro equipos de excavación arqueológica, así como entrevistas a reutilizadores de datos arqueológicos, para evaluar cómo los arqueólogos utilizan e implementan pautas escritas. Las experiencias de estos equipos de excavación y reutilizadores sugieren que los arqueólogos necesitan prácticas óptimas más específicas para crear e implementar pautas escritas que mejoren la calidad y usabilidad de los datos arqueológicos. Este artículo presenta varias recomendaciones para mejorar las pautas escritas que se centran en los métodos del proyecto, la documentación al final de la temporada y las prácticas de denominación. Los hallazgos muestran que tanto las prácticas de datos estandarizados como interpretativos son necesarias para crear datos consistentes, comparables y comprensibles. Además, el artículo incluye una Lista de verificación de pautas escritas para ayudar a los directores de proyectos a mejorar sus pautas escritas antes, durante y después del trabajo de campo como parte de un proceso colaborativo. Idealmente, estas mejores prácticas para las pautas escritas facilitarán que los miembros del equipo y los futuros reutilizadores incorporen sus propios datos arqueológicos y los de otros en su investigación.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Austin","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Faniel","given":"Ixchel M."},{"family":"Brannon","given":"Brittany"},{"family":"Kansa","given":"Sarah Whitcher"}],"citation-key":"austin2024","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","container-title-short":"Adv. archaeol. pract.","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2023.38","ISSN":"2326-3768","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,25]]},"language":"en","page":"1-12","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Improving the Usability of Archaeological Data through Written Guidelines","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S2326376823000384/type/journal_article"},

  {"id":"azadbakht2023","abstract":"To encourage the sharing of research, various entities—including public and private funders, universities, and academic journals—have enacted open access (OA) mandates or data sharing policies. It is unclear, however, whether these OA mandates and policies increase the rate of OA publishing and data sharing within the research communities impacted by them. A team of librarians conducted a systematized review of the literature to answer this question. A comprehensive search of several scholarly databases and grey literature sources resulted in 4,689 unique citations. However, only five articles met the inclusion criteria and were deemed as having an acceptable risk of bias. This sample showed that although the majority of the mandates described in the literature were correlated with a subsequent increase in OA publishing or data sharing, the presence of various confounders and the differing methods of collecting and analyzing the data used by the studies’ authors made it impossible to establish a causative relationship.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Azadbakht","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Radniecki","given":"Tara"},{"family":"Schultz","given":"Teresa Auch"},{"family":"Shannon","given":"Amy"}],"citation-key":"azadbakht2023","container-title":"Journal of Librarianship and Scholarly Communication","DOI":"10.31274/jlsc.15444","ISSN":"2162-3309","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,7]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Iowa State University Digital Press","source":"www.iastatedigitalpress.com","title":"Do Open Access Mandates Work?

  {"id":"bacevic2018","abstract":"Digital technologies have made access to and profit from scientific publications hotly contested issues. Debates over open access (OA), however, rarely extend from questions of distribution to questions of how OA is transforming the politics of academic knowledge production. This article argues that the movement towards OA rests on a relatively stable moral episteme that positions different actors involved in the economy of OA (authors, publishers, the general public), and most importantly, knowledge itself. The analysis disentangles the ontological and moral side of these claims, showing how OA changes the meaning of knowledge from a good in the economic, to good in the moral sense. This means OA can be theorized as the moral economy of digital knowledge production. Ultimately, using Boltanski and Thévenot’s work on justification, the article reflects on how this moral economy frames the political subjectivity of actors and institutions involved in academic knowledge production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Bacevic","given":"Jana"},{"family":"Muellerleile","given":"Chris"}],"citation-key":"bacevic2018","container-title":"European Journal of Social Theory","DOI":"10.1177/1368431017717368","ISSN":"1368-4310","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"169-188","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The moral economy of open access","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1368431017717368","volume":"21"},

Newly obtained radiocarbon dates that place the pits between 4000?3800 BC make them amongst the earliest Neolithic features in Sussex and southern England. It is proposed that the pits (collectively known as Pit X) display connections not only to the nearby flint mines, but also to the immediate coastal zone and to wider England.

Palimpsests are shown to be a universal phenomenon of the material world, and to form a series of overlapping categories, which vary according to their geographical scale, temporal resolution and completeness of preservation. Archaeological examples are used to show how different types of palimpsest can be analyzed to address different sorts of questions about the time dimension of human experience, and the relationship between different types of processes and different scales of phenomena. Objections to the apparently deterministic and asocial character of time perspectivism, and its apparent neglect of subjective experience and individual action and perception, are dealt with.

Historical ecology contains core postulates that concern qualitative types of human-mediated disturbance of natural environments and the effect of these on species diversity, among other parameters. A central term used in historical ecology to situate human behavior and agency in the environment is the landscape, as derived from historical geography, instead of the ecosystem, which is from systems ecology. Historical ecology is similar to nonequilibrium dynamic theory, but differs in its postulate of human-mediated disturbance as a principle of landscape transformation. Such disturbances counterintuitively may involve anthropogenic primary and secondary succession that result in net increases of alpha and even beta diversity. Applied historical ecology can supply the reference conditions of time depth and traditional knowledge to restore past landscapes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Balée","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"balee2006","container-title":"Annual Review of Anthropology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123231","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"page":"75-98","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"The Research Program of Historical Ecology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123231","volume":"35"},

An increasing use of regional surveys to collect primary archaeological data has accompanied this shift. These surveys have encountered many methodological and theoretical problems but at the same time they show promise for addressing previously unexamined questions in the history and prehistory of the Near East. With a focus on applications of regional survey to studies of rural settlement and economy in the dryfarming areas of the southern Levant, this article defines some problems in exploiting the potential of archaeological survey in the southern Levant's physical and cultural environments. Archaeological surveys in other parts of the Near East suggest some ways to do this, but are not necessarily appropriate in the Levant.

  {"id":"banning2006a","abstract":"This paper presents the results of several experiments to investigate how the detection functions of surveyors vary for different artifact types on surfaces with differing visibility when visual surface inspection (“fieldwalking”) is the survey method. As prospecting theory predicts, successful detection declines exponentially with distance away from transects and detection as a function of search time displays diminishing returns. However, these functions vary by visibility, artifact type, and other factors. The incidence of false targets–incorrect identifications of artifacts–has somewhat more impact at greater range but has little or no relationship with search time. Our results provide a rationale for selection of transect intervals and distribution of survey effort, and also facilitate evaluation of survey results, allowing more realistic estimates of how much a survey missed.\n, \nRésumé\nEste articulo describe los resultados obtenidos a través de varios experimentos destinados a investigar cómo la deteccidn de distintos tipos de material arqueológico es afectada por la visibilidad del terreno durante prospecciones superficiales.

La incidencia de falsos objetivos–artefactos identificados erróneamente–es mayor con distancia pew apenas se ve afectada por el tiempo de búsqueda o rastreo.

  {"id":"banning2017","abstract":"To have confidence in the results of an archaeological survey, whether for heritage management or research objectives, we must have some assurance that the survey was carried out to a reasonably high standard. This paper discusses the use of Quality Assurance (QA) approaches and empirical methods for estimating surveys’ effectiveness at discovering archaeological artifacts as a means for ensuring quality standards. We illustrate with the example of two surveys in Cyprus and Jordan in which resurvey, measurement of surveyor “sweep widths,” and realistic estimates of survey coverage allow us to evaluate explicitly the probability that the survey missed pottery or lithics, as well as to decide when survey has been thorough enough to warrant moving to another survey unit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Banning","given":"E.

  {"id":"banning2021","abstract":"After a heyday in the 1970s and 1980s, probability sampling became much less visible in archaeological literature as it came under assault from the post-processual critique and the widespread adoption of “full-coverage survey.” After 1990, published discussion of probability sampling rarely strayed from sample-size issues in analyses of artifacts along with plant and animal remains, and most textbooks and archaeological training limited sampling to regional survey and did little to equip new generations of archaeologists with this critical aspect of research design. A review of the last 20 years of archaeological literature indicates a need for deeper and broader archaeological training in sampling; more precise usage of terms such as “sample”; use of randomization as a control in experimental design; and more attention to cluster sampling, stratified sampling, and nonspatial sampling in both training and research.\n, \nDespués de un apogeo en los años setenta y ochenta, el muestreo probabilístico se hizo mucho menos visible en la literatura arqueológica, ya que se vio amenazado por la crítica posprocesal y la adopción común de la “encuesta de cobertura completa”. Después de 1990, la discusión publicada sobre el muestreo probabilístico rara vez se desvió de los problemas del tamaño de la muestra en los análisis de artefactos, restos de plantas y animales, mientras que la mayoría de los libros de texto y el entrenamiento arqueológico limitaron el muestreo al estudio regional e hicieron poco para equipar a las nuevas generaciones de arqueólogos con este aspecto crítico de diseño de la investigación. Un resumen de los últimos 20 años de literatura arqueológica indica la necesidad de una formación arqueológica más profunda y amplia en el muestreo, el uso más preciso de términos como “muestra”, el uso de la aleatorización como control en el diseño experimental y una mayor atención al muestreo conglomerado, muestro estratificado, y muestreo no espacial tanto en capacitación como en investigación.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Banning","given":"Edward B."}],"citation-key":"banning2021","container-title":"American Antiquity","DOI":"10.1017/aaq.2020.39","ISSN":"0002-7316, 2325-5064","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","page":"43-60","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Sampled to Death?

  {"id":"barthe2019","abstract":"Science and technology studies (STS) has cultivated a positive vision of technological controversies. By raising new issues to address, controversies are seen as generating more thorough and exhaustive processes of technology assessment. However, the ability to view controversies in this light remains dependent upon how technology is collectively imagined and understood. If it is envisioned as a classic technological fix then broader controversy is just what is intended to be overcome, not positively indulged. Albert Hirschman’s distinction between divisible and non-divisible conflicts captures such varying evaluations of controversy. In particular, it helps analyse how the long-standing fix of geological disposal of nuclear waste has been persistently defended as a non-negotiable object of technological concern – a recipe for escaping controversy by permanently isolating nuclear waste from the biosphere. Comparing the Swedish and French programmes for the geological disposal of nuclear waste shows how defending the technological integrity of a non-divisible disposal concept has remained an institutional fixation for Swedish nuclear waste management for over 30 years. In contrast, legislative demands for a reversible disposal concept introduced in France in the late 1990s have arguably served to unravel a technological fix into a divisible object of collective concern.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Barthe","given":"Yannick"},{"family":"Elam","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Sundqvist","given":"Göran"}],"citation-key":"barthe2019","container-title":"Science as Culture","DOI":"10.1080/09505431.2019.1645108","ISSN":"0950-5431","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,26]]},"page":"1-23","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Technological Fix or Divisible Object of Collective Concern?

  {"id":"basik2013","abstract":"The majority of samples in existing tumour biobanks are surgical specimens of primary tumours. Insights into tumour biology, such as intratumoural heterogeneity, tumour–host crosstalk, and the evolution of the disease during therapy, require biospecimens from the primary tumour and those that reflect the patient's disease in specific contexts. Next-generation 'omics' technologies facilitate deep interrogation of tumours, but the characteristics of the samples can determine the ultimate accuracy of the results. The challenge is to biopsy tumours, in some cases serially over time, ensuring that the samples are representative, viable, and adequate both in quantity and quality for subsequent molecular applications. The collection of next-generation biospecimens, tumours, and blood samples at defined time points during the disease trajectory—either for discovery research or to guide clinical decisions—presents additional challenges and opportunities. From an organizational perspective, it also requires new additions to the multidisciplinary therapeutic team, notably interventional radiologists, molecular pathologists, and bioinformaticians. In this Review, we describe the existing procedures for sample procurement and processing of next-generation biospecimens, and highlight the issues involved in this endeavour, including the ethical, logistical, scientific, informational, and financial challenges accompanying next-generation biobanking.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Basik","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Aguilar-Mahecha","given":"Adriana"},{"family":"Rousseau","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Diaz","given":"Zuanel"},{"family":"Tejpar","given":"Sabine"},{"family":"Spatz","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Greenwood","given":"Celia M.

  {"id":"batist2021","abstract":"Archaeological practice is increasingly enacted within pervasive and invisible digital infrastructures, tools, and services that affect how participants engage in learning and fieldwork, and how evidence, knowledge, and expertise are produced. This article discusses the collective imaginings regarding the present and future of digital archaeological practice held by researchers working in two archaeological projects in the Eastern Mediterranean, who have normalized the use of digital tools and the adoption of digital processes in their studies. It is a part of E-CURATORS, a research project investigating how archaeologists in multiple contexts and settings incorporate pervasive digital technologies in their studies. Based on an analysis of qualitative interviews, we interpret the arguments advanced by study participants on aspects of digital work, learning, and expertise. We find that, in their sayings, participants not only characterize digital tools and workflows as having positive instrumental value, but also recognize that they may severely constrain the autonomy and agency of researchers as knowledge workers through the hyper-granularization of data, the erosion of expertise, and the mechanization of work. Participants advance a notion of digital archaeology based on do-it-yourself (DIY) practice and craft to reclaim agency from the algorithmic power of digital technology and to establish fluid, positional distribution of roles and agency, and mutual validation of expertise. Operating within discourses of labour vs efficiency, and technocracy vs agency, sayings, elicited within the archaeological situated practice in the wild, become doings, echoing archaeology’s anxiety in the face of pervasive digital technology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Batist","given":"Zachary"},{"family":"Masters","given":"Val"},{"family":"Torma","given":"Tiffany C."},{"family":"Carter","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Ferris","given":"Neal"},{"family":"Huvila","given":"Isto"},{"family":"Ross","given":"Seamus"},{"family":"Dallas","given":"Costis"}],"citation-key":"batist2021","container-title":"Open Archaeology","DOI":"10.1515/opar-2020-0217","ISSN":"2300-6560","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"language":"en","license":"All rights reserved","page":"1731-1755","publisher":"De Gruyter Open Access","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"Figurations of Digital Practice, Craft, and Agency in Two Mediterranean Fieldwork Projects","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opar-2020-0217/html","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"batist2023a","abstract":"This dissertation critically examines the sociotechnical structures that archaeologists rely on to coordinate their research and manage their data. I frame data as discursive media that communicate archaeological encounters, which enable archaeologists to form productive collaboration relationships. All archaeological activities involve data work, as archaeologists simultaneously account for the decisions and circumstances that framed the information they rely on to perform their own practices, while anticipating how their information outputs will be used by others in the future. All archaeological activities are therefore loci of practical epistemic convergence, where meanings are negotiated in relation to communally-held objectives. Through observations of and interviews with archaeologists at work, and analysis of the documents they produce, I articulate how data sharing relates distributed work experiences as part of a continuum of practice. I highlight the assumptions and value regimes that underlie the social and technical structures that support productive archaeological work, and draw attention to the inseparable relationship between the management of labour and data. I also relate this discursive view of data sharing to the open data movement, and suggest that it is necessary to develop new collaborative commitments pertaining to data publication and reuse that are more in line with disciplinary norms, expectations, and value regimes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,2]]},"archive":"Zenodo","author":[{"family":"Batist","given":"Zachary"}],"citation-key":"batist2023a","event-place":"Toronto","genre":"PhD","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"eng","license":"All rights reserved","publisher":"University of Toronto","publisher-place":"Toronto","source":"Zenodo","title":"Archaeological data work as continuous and collaborative practice","type":"thesis","URL":"https://hdl.handle.net/1807/130306"},

  {"id":"batist2024a","abstract":"Abstract\n            Archaeological data simultaneously serve as formal documentary evidence that supports and legitimizes chains of analytical inference and as communicative media that bind together scholarly activities distributed across time, place, and social circumstance. This contributes to a sense of “epistemic anxiety,” whereby archaeologists require that data be objective and decisive to support computational analysis but also intuitively understand data to be subjective and situated based on their own experiences as participants in an archaeological community of practice. In this article, I present observations of and elicitations about archaeological practices relating to the constitution and transformation of data in three cases in order to articulate this tension and document how archaeologists cope with it. I found that archaeologists rely on a wide variety of situated representations of archaeological experiences – which are either not recorded at all or occupy entirely separate and unpublished data streams – to make sense of more formal records. This undervalued information is crucial for ensuring that relatively local, bounded, and private collaborative ties may be extended beyond the scope of a project and, therefore, should be given more attention as we continue to develop open data infrastructures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Batist","given":"Zachary"}],"citation-key":"batist2024a","container-title":"Open Archaeology","DOI":"10.1515/opar-2024-0014","ISSN":"2300-6560","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,30]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","page":"20240014","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"On the Value of Informal Communication in Archaeological Data Work","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opar-2024-0014/html","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"beale2014","abstract":"In the 1980's archaeologists embraced the rapidly expanding field of computer modelling and visualisation as a vehicle for data exploration. Against this backdrop ‘virtual archaeology’ was conceived. The term was originally intended to describe a multi-dimensional approach to the modelling of the physical structures and processes of field archaeology. It described the way in which technology could be harnessed in order to achieve new ways of documenting, interpreting and annotating primary archaeological materials and processes.\n\nDespite their initial promise, these technologies have failed to have the impact upon archaeological fieldwork which might have been expected. Even with the prevalence of digital devices on all archaeological excavations the documentation, interpretation and subsequent narration of archaeological processes have retained their analogue character. While the archaeological record is now primarily digital, its sections, plans, drawings and photographs are facsimiles of the analogue technologies which preceded them. This retention of analogue conventions is increasingly out of step with the general prevalence of digital technologies and especially 21st century advances towards 'programmable matter' which could bring the world of virtual archaeology into closer alignment with the material one.\n\nThis paper will argue that developments in the capabilities and ubiquity of digital devices coupled with rapid increases in digital literacy among archaeologists, has the capacity to revolutionise the investigation, documentation, interpretation, and narration of the archaeological process","author":[{"family":"Beale","given":"Gareth"},{"family":"Reilly","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"beale2014","container-title":"CAA 2014 Paris: 21st Century Archaeology","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"source":"Google Scholar","title":"Virtual archaeology in a material world: new technologies enabling novel perspectives","title-short":"Virtual archaeology in a material world","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"beck2011","abstract":"Anyone concerned about food risks related, for example, to acrylamide, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or food supplements is confronted with vast and complex landscapes of political debates, with various uncertainties, contested responsibilities, competing knowledge and ambivalent value‐making. In risk assessment procedures, these fluid complexities often get simplified to come to any evaluation at all. A retrospective review of risk scandals, however, highlights that most risks arise just from those connections in production, usage and disposal which remained unseen or were even blinded out during previous risk assessment. To better deal with these ‘unknown unknowns’, society at large and decision‐makers in particular need not only new strategies to avoid manufactured uncertainties but also more comprehensive knowledge tools and concepts to fully explore potential sources and connections of hazards, risks and uncertainties. Facing this challenge of risk governance, the paper discusses the potential of the visualisation (‘mapping’) of risk controversies and introduces the concept of ‘risk infrastructures’. The aim is to equip stakeholders, laypersons and decision‐makers with risk mappings which make visible how competing knowledge claims, protagonists, institutional settings, facts and values are related to each other. It will do so in referring to a prototype software application of such a ‘re‐assembling strategy’ (Actor‐Network‐Theory (ANT)) called ‘Risk Cartography’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Beck","given":"Gerald"},{"family":"Kropp","given":"Cordula"}],"citation-key":"beck2011","container-title":"Journal of Risk Research","DOI":"10.1080/13669877.2010.505348","ISSN":"1366-9877","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",1,1]]},"page":"1-16","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Infrastructures of risk: a mapping approach towards controversies on risks","title-short":"Infrastructures of risk","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13669877.2010.505348","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"beck2012","abstract":"By unblocking knowledge bottle-necks and enhancing collaborative and creative input ‘open’ approaches have the potential to revolutionize science, humanities and arts. ‘Open’ has captured the Zeitgeist, but what is it all about? Is it about providing clear and transparent access to knowledge objects: data, theories and knowledge (open access, open data, open methods, open knowledge)? Is it about providing similar access to knowledge acquisition processes (open science)? Obviously it is; however, this is not the whole story. Open approaches require active engagement. This is not just engagement from the ‘usual suspects’ but engagement from a broader societal base. For example, primary data creators need the appropriate incentives to provide access to Open Data – these incentives will vary between different groups: contract archaeologists, curatorial archaeologists and research archaeologists all have different drivers. Equally important is that open approaches raise a number of issues about data access and downstream data reuse. This paper will discuss these issues in relation to the current situation in the UK and in the context of the DART project: an Open Science research project.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Beck","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Neylon","given":"Cameron"}],"citation-key":"beck2012","container-title":"World Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00438243.2012.737581","ISSN":"0043-8243","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",12,1]]},"page":"479-497","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"A vision for Open Archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00438243.2012.737581","volume":"44"},

  {"id":"beckjr.2007","abstract":"Unexpected ruptures in material culture patterning present interpretive challenges for archaeological narratives of social change. The concept of the event, as proposed by William Sewell Jr., offers a robust theoretical vocabulary for understanding the sudden appearance of novel patterning. Sewell defines historical events as sequences of happenings or occurrences that transform social structures by creating durable ruptures between material resources and their associated virtual schemas. Thus conceived, events occur in three phases: (1) a sequence of contingent happenings produces (2) ruptures in the articulation of resources and schemas, creating (3) an opportunity for rearticulation within new frames of reference. This perspective has much to recommend it for archaeology because it explicitly and uniquely grounds the concepts of structure, structural change, and agency in ma- teriality. The implications of this approach are apparent in the cases of Iceland’s conversion to Christianity (AD 1000–1050), barrow construction during Denmark’s Bronze Age (1700–1500 BC), platform construction at Formative Chiripa, Bolivia (450–400 BC), and the planning and layout of Mississippian Cahokia, Illinois (AD 1050–1100).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Beck Jr.","given":"Robin A."},{"family":"Bolender","given":"Douglas J."},{"family":"Brown","given":"James A."},{"family":"Earle","given":"Timothy K."}],"citation-key":"beckjr.2007","container-title":"Current Anthropology","DOI":"10.1086/520974","ISSN":"0011-3204, 1537-5382","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",12]]},"language":"en","page":"833-860","source":"CrossRef","title":"Eventful Archaeology: The Place of Space in Structural Transformation","title-short":"Eventful Archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/520974","volume":"48"},
  {"id":"bedny2005","abstract":"This article offers an introduction to the central concepts and principles of the Systemic-Structural Theory of Activity (SSTA), an activity-theoretical approach specifically tailored to the analysis and design of human work. In activity theory, cognition is understood both as a process and as a structured system of actions. Building on the general theory of activity, SSTA's use of structurally organized analytical units makes it possible to develop taxonomies and theoretical models of human activity which provide a scientific basis for ergonomic design, education, and industrial-organizational psychology. The primary focus of this article is on design problems in ergonomics. Whereas cognitive psychology has shown a tendency to reduce design problem solving to experimental procedures, systemic-structural activity analyses focus on the interrelation between the structure of work activity and the configuration of the material components of work. SSTA presents methods for the classification and description of human work activity, identifying activity during task performance as the primary object of study, using action as one of the major units of analysis. We outline some applications of SSTA to the study of human work processes, and define and discuss some basic concepts and principles of activity theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Bedny","given":"Gregory Z."},{"family":"Harris","given":"Steven Robert"}],"citation-key":"bedny2005","container-title":"Mind, Culture, and Activity","DOI":"10.1207/s15327884mca1202_4","ISSN":"1074-9039","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",5,1]]},"page":"128-147","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The Systemic-Structural Theory of Activity: Applications to the Study of Human Work","title-short":"The Systemic-Structural Theory of Activity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327884mca1202_4","volume":"12"},

Digital repositories are now recognized as essential for data stewardship and are setting standards for data deposition. These new technologies and systems support the scientific need for reproducible results through intra-cultural as well as cross-cultural hypothesis testing. Methods of digital data collection in the field, however, are often site specific, restricted by the limited availability of digital technologies, or not well suited for creating systems that support the requirements of the new digital information paradigm. As a small science project, the Chau Hiix Project in Belize will provide examples of the pitfalls in and insights about shifting to digital technology to make its primary data shareable and reusable.

Because the site was the largest Japanese and Japanese American concentration camp on O‘ahu, the field school initiated a program related to social justice and democratic principles for the imprisonment of US citizens and legal residents based on racial and national profiling. The demography of O‘ahu created a special bond to the incarcerees’ stories and the students of Asian and Hawaiian descent. Through field trips, student discussion, and curriculum development, we focused on the pedagogical benefit of experiential learning. Field trips to the National Park Service's World War II Valor in the Pacific Park System on O‘ahu, King Kamehameha V Judiciary History Center, and the Japanese Cultural Center of Hawai‘i allowed the students to see and understand the historical context of the Japanese internment from the mid-nineteenth century, with the development of plantations and early colonialism, to the beginning of World War II and the internment of the more than 300 Japanese and Japanese American—as well as European and Okinawan—civilians and the imprisonment of over 4,000 prisoners of war.\n, \nDe 2016 a 2019, la Universidad de Hawai‘i West Oahu llevó a cabo una escuela de campo arqueológico en el Sitio Histórico Nacional Honouliuli para enseñar a estudiantes de pregrado y posgrado, tanto de Hawai‘i como de los EE.

  {"id":"benardou2017","abstract":"This introduction presents an overview of the key concepts discussed in this book. The book introduces perspectives on a number of initiatives that have developed resources, tools, services and methods for digital research engagement with cultural heritage content. It argues that Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities-European Union (DARIAH-EU) focus[es] on Research Infrastructures rather than library and archive integration projects such as Europeana, because Research Infrastructures share the ultimate aim to action research. The book aims to extend critique to the role and effectiveness of Research Infrastructure in practice. The intimate interdependence between the affordances of Research Infrastructures and the scholarly methods and practices they enable is confirmed by work in the broader domain of practice studies, and in the more focused area of infrastructure studies. A benefit of digital Research Infrastructures is that they can become the hub for nurturing an interdisciplinary community of researchers working on focused and discrete research themes or topics.","author":[{"family":"Benardou","given":"Agiatis"},{"family":"Champion","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Dallas","given":"Costis"},{"family":"Hughes","given":"Lorna M."}],"citation-key":"benardou2017","container-title":"Cultural Heritage Infrastructures in Digital Humanities","ISBN":"978-1-315-57527-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"number-of-pages":"14","publisher":"Routledge","title":"Introduction: a critique of digital practices and research infrastructures","title-short":"Introduction","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"bennett2013","abstract":"This article enquires into the motivations of ‘bunkerologists’ – a term coined for analytic convenience by the author to describe those who research, explore and survey twentieth century military bunkers as a hobby. Specifically, it considers the gendered dimension of this predominantly male pastime. In doing so, the article examines the role of a range of cultural influences, including signification of militarism, inter-generational initiation and remembrance around themes of defence and labour, human-technology relations, conquest, and hermitic escapism. These factors all appear to have roles to play in disposing individuals towards participation in this practice. The analysis finds the source of many of these influences within a particular mode of English male socialisation, and masculinities related to it, prevalent in the late twentieth century. The analysis presented is also grounded in an auto-ethnographic exploration of the biographical roots of the author's own choice of this research topic and the effect of the research upon him and his family. Whilst the subject matter of the study may be regarded as somewhat arcane, the analysis of the role of socialisation within routes to participation in this predominantly masculine pastime may help to illuminate the motivational frameworks of other rarely studied, and seemingly introverted, ‘male’ hobbies such as train spotting, stamp collecting and sport fishing (angling).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Bennett","given":"Luke"}],"citation-key":"bennett2013","container-title":"Gender, Place & Culture","DOI":"10.1080/0966369X.2012.701197","ISSN":"0966-369X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,1]]},"page":"630-646","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Who goes there?

  {"id":"bennett2021","abstract":"Open science serves to address core issues that are unique to quantitative methods in psychology, though it is typically presented as an appropriate framework for psychological research in general. In the present article, I critically examine the context within which open science operates as I bring that perspective into dialogue with priorities and goals of research that are both qualitative and feminist. I orient this examination in response to the question: what does open science mean for research methodologies that have historically been a home for transgressive and radical question-asking? Questioning the purposes of key tenets like replication and statistical significance—values systems that pose central distinctions between quantitative and qualitative methods—begs bigger questions for feminist psychologists. What counts as science? What counts as a valid epistemology? How can we avoid a further marginalization of epistemologies deemed less valid? I explore these questions, followed by a possible reimagining of our field’s engagement with open science in which I present seven suggestions to practically guide this endeavor.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Bennett","given":"Elizabeth A."}],"citation-key":"bennett2021","container-title":"Psychology of Women Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/03616843211036460","ISSN":"0361-6843","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"448-456","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Open Science From a Qualitative, Feminist Perspective: Epistemological Dogmas and a Call for Critical Examination","title-short":"Open Science From a Qualitative, Feminist Perspective","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/03616843211036460","volume":"45"},

  {"id":"bergeron2018","abstract":"Background The lack of accessible and structured documentation creates major barriers for investigators interested in understanding, properly interpreting and analyzing cohort data and biological samples. Providing the scientific community with open information is essential to optimize usage of these resources. A cataloguing toolkit is proposed by Maelstrom Research to answer these needs and support the creation of comprehensive and user-friendly study- and network-specific web-based metadata catalogues. Methods Development of the Maelstrom Research cataloguing toolkit was initiated in 2004. It was supported by the exploration of existing catalogues and standards, and guided by input from partner initiatives having used or pilot tested incremental versions of the toolkit. Results The cataloguing toolkit is built upon two main components: a metadata model and a suite of open-source software applications. The model sets out specific fields to describe study profiles; characteristics of the subpopulations of participants; timing and design of data collection events; and datasets/variables collected at each data collection event. It also includes the possibility to annotate variables with different classification schemes. When combined, the model and software support implementation of study and variable catalogues and provide a powerful search engine to facilitate data discovery. Conclusions The Maelstrom Research cataloguing toolkit already serves several national and international initiatives and the suite of software is available to new initiatives through the Maelstrom Research website. With the support of new and existing partners, we hope to ensure regular improvements of the toolkit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Bergeron","given":"Julie"},{"family":"Doiron","given":"Dany"},{"family":"Marcon","given":"Yannick"},{"family":"Ferretti","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Fortier","given":"Isabel"}],"citation-key":"bergeron2018","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0200926","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,24]]},"language":"en","page":"e0200926","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Fostering population-based cohort data discovery: The Maelstrom Research cataloguing toolkit","title-short":"Fostering population-based cohort data discovery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0200926","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"berggren2018","abstract":"The ‘digital turn’ in archaeology has resulted in documentation, analysis, visualization and repository requirements becoming increasingly digital in recent years. However, we are only at the beginning of understanding how the shift from analogue to digital affects archaeological interpretation, as attention has mainly been directed towards technological aspects. However, how archaeology is executed influences the production of archaeological knowledge, and additional research into digital practices and their consequences is needed. During the latest excavation in 2014 of the Neolithic flint mines of Södra Sallerup, in Malmö in southern Sweden, several recording methods were used to document the remains in plan, including hand drawing, digital mapping with GPS and digital photography using a camera mounted on a pole.

  {"id":"berrocal-rangel2016","abstract":"The most distinctive productions from Iron Age archaeology in the western part of the Central Iberian Peninsula are large ramparts, and big animal sculptures, both of which were usually made in granite. The latter, known as ‘verracos’, are representations of male boars and bulls. A characteristic of these ‘verracos’ is their lack of original context, thus leading to mere speculation regarding their dates and functions. The aim of this paper is to find an answer to this dilemma using archaeometric methods. This document proposes an approach through geochemical and petrological analyses, as well as statistical analyses using variables. Our target tries to recognize any differences in the making of these sculptures that might help explain functional and symbolic changes to help in understanding their unknown original contexts. For this purpose we arranged 84 sculptures by sizes, technical features and anatomical detail using a Correspondence multivariate analysis and, with the results by series, observed their spatial relationship with 34 quarries too, through kernel density applications. In order to know the origins of the stones of each sculpture, we have made geochemical characterization by mineral and chemical analyses of mayor and minor elements. Therefore, we looked for quarries around the finding place of the verracos. When the possible places were found by lithological affinities, we took samples from those, mostly granite rocks. These geochemical and petrological analyses of the sculptures have contributed towards identifying the potential locations of the quarries of origin, which coincide with the analyses of ‘verracos’ found far away from those quarries and that are completely decontextualized. Therefore, we could obtain least-cost paths distances between quarries and matched sculptures by GIS software (over a digital elevation map) and, then, calculate averages distances per series and quarries. Sizes, shapes and spatial relationships with quarries and nearby oppida, big fortified settlements of Iron Age, allow us to identify oldest verracos as symbols of the emergence of ethnical and communal values, as a result of the impact of the first Mediterranean people arriving to the Spanish plateau, such as the Punic and Roman armies. In this way, big verracos were transported 'till 20 and 30km away from the quarries. However, with the Roman rule over this region, verracos became smaller and simpler, and displacements were outstandingly smaller. This is related with a change of functions, from protection symbols of the communities to funerary stelae of individual graves.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Berrocal-Rangel","given":"Luis"},{"family":"García-Giménez","given":"Rosario"},{"family":"Manglano","given":"Gregorio R."},{"family":"Ruano","given":"Lucía"}],"citation-key":"berrocal-rangel2016","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2016.03.031","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",4,23]]},"source":"ScienceDirect","title":"When archaeological context is lacking.

  {"id":"bevan2012a","abstract":"This paper argues that two major related trends -- the now substantial circulation of digital archaeological datasets and the increasing number of ways in which people engage with archaeology via online media -- should encourage us to reassess what value we and others wish to place on the past, how we share archaeological information and what kinds of archaeological communities we wish to promote. One useful approach to these questions is via social anthropological theory that addresses valuation, authority and the structuring of inter-personal relationships. Understanding the degree to which these features of social life are, or are not, transformed by new digital communication technologies also helps us to re-conceptualise archaeological communication with new priorities and opportunities in mind. This paper explores these ideas further via two case studies involving the sharing of spatial or spatio-temporal knowledge: (a) open data and open source software for spatial analysis, and (b) neogeography and geocaching.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bevan","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"bevan2012a","container-title":"Archaeology and Digital Communication: Towards Strategies of Public Engagement","editor":[{"family":"Bonacchi","given":"Chiara"}],"event-place":"London, UK","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"eng","license":"open","page":"1-14","publisher":"Archetype","publisher-place":"London, UK","source":"discovery.ucl.ac.uk","title":"Value, Authority and the Open Society.

  {"id":"bezuidenhout2017","abstract":"Poor provision of information and communication technologies in low/middle-income countries represents a concern for promoting open data. This is often framed as a ‘digital divide’ and addressed through initiatives that increase the availability of information and communication technologies to researchers based in low-resourced environments, as well as the amount of resources freely accessible online. Using qualitative empirical data from a study of lab-based research in Africa we highlight the limitations of this framing and emphasize the range of additional factors necessary to effectively utilize data available online. We adapt Sen’s ‘capabilities approach’ to highlight the distinction between simply making resources available, and fostering researchers’ ability to use them. This provides an alternative orientation that highlights the persistence of deep inequalities within the seemingly egalitarian-inspired open data landscape. We propose that the extent and manner of future data sharing will hinge on the ability to respond to the heterogeneity of research environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bezuidenhout","given":"Louise M."},{"family":"Leonelli","given":"Sabina"},{"family":"Kelly","given":"Ann H."},{"family":"Rappert","given":"Brian"}],"citation-key":"bezuidenhout2017","container-title":"Science and Public Policy","container-title-short":"Science and Public Policy","DOI":"10.1093/scipol/scw036","ISSN":"0302-3427","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,1]]},"page":"464-475","source":"Silverchair","title":"Beyond the digital divide: Towards a situated approach to open data","title-short":"Beyond the digital divide","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/scipol/scw036","volume":"44"},
  {"id":"bezzi2018","abstract":"This contribution summarizes the multiple uses of 3D web technologies in commercial archaeology. Considering the breadth of this topic, we will describe each different branch of these technologies with the example of case studies based on work of the Italian company Arc-Team. Our overview begins with 3D visualization for scientific purposes, showing a project funded by the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol (Italy) in order to improve knowledge about WWI. Second, we analyze a similar project, funded by the Autonomous Province of Trentino (Italy), but with the aim to increase tourism at a high alpine WWI site. The third example is the development of another prototype for tourism: a 3D web-map for the cultural valorization of the historical border (1753) between the region Tyrol and the Most Serene Republic of Venice. In the forth case study, we discuss the implementation of 3D within web platforms for archaeological project management of RAPTOR (Ricerca Archivi e Pratiche per la Tutela Operativa Regionale), a webGIS developed to aid in preservation and conservation efforts of cultural heritage for the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism (MiBACT). Fifth, we explore recent uses of 3D models for web-coworking during the process of excavation management, thanks to the developments of real-time 3D acquisition techniques based on SLAM algorithms and archeorobotic devices. Finally, 3D web-coworking is also analyzed illustrating some simple web tools that afford rapid feedback in data visualization, considering not only excavation field-work but also exploration projects. This overview, based on six different case studies, represents the four fields in which 3D web technologies are currently used in commercial archaeology: scientific communication; tourism improvement; preservation of cultural heritage; and real time field-work management. Some specific topics such as tourism improvement and field-work management are investigated in greater depth in order to allow us to analyze variables deriving from customer requests (e.g. restrictions regarding sensitive geolocation or preferences for specific web platforms) and from differences among data acquisition technologies based on various sensors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Bezzi","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Bezzi","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Boscaro","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Feistmantl","given":"Kathrin"},{"family":"Gietl","given":"Rupert"},{"family":"Naponiello","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Ottati","given":"Fabiano"},{"family":"Guzman","given":"Margarita","dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"bezzi2018","container-title":"Journal of Field Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00934690.2018.1505410","ISSN":"0093-4690","issue":"sup1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,31]]},"page":"S45-S59","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Commercial Archaeology and 3D Web Technologies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00934690.2018.1505410","volume":"43"},

  {"id":"bietz2012","abstract":"Scientific information infrastructures, or cyberinfrastructures, are expected to operate over long time scales, but this creates challenges for the design of those infrastructures. This paper reports on a qualitative study of cyberinfrastructure development in the emerging field of metagenomics to illustrate some of the issues that can arise when cyberinfrastructures are faced with new scientific communities, practices, and research questions. New science inevitably brings new forms of data, new analysis tools, and the need to recontextualize existing data. Cyberinfrastructures must be prepared to adapt to the new scientific context. In this study, developers employed three strategies for addressing new scientific requirements: work-arounds, extensions, and from-scratch development. These strategies are informed by the tension between fitting the CI to the needs of a specific community and maintaining interoperability across systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Bietz","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Charlotte P."}],"citation-key":"bietz2012","collection-title":"iConference '12","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2012 iConference","DOI":"10.1145/2132176.2132200","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-0782-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,7]]},"page":"183–190","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Adapting cyberinfrastructure to new science: tensions and strategies","title-short":"Adapting cyberinfrastructure to new science","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2132176.2132200"},

Schiffer, represents a series of partially misguided postures relative to some important points of debate common in the 1960s. Due to failures to understand some points at issue, behavioral archaeologists appear to embrace many of the methods and goals of traditional archaeology, and thereby present a \"reactionary\" position rather than a \"revisionist\" position, as it has claimed. The issues upon which behavioral archaeology appears most reactionary are points most urgently in need of change, if archaeology is to progress as a discipline contributing both to our knowledge of the past and to our understanding of historical trends.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Binford","given":"Lewis R."}],"citation-key":"binford1981","container-title":"Journal of Anthropological Research","DOI":"10.2307/3629723","ISSN":"0091-7710","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1981"]]},"page":"195-208","source":"JSTOR","title":"Behavioral Archaeology and the \"Pompeii Premise\"","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3629723","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"bjork2014","abstract":"Open access (OA) is free, unrestricted access to electronic versions of scholarly publications. For peer-reviewed journal articles, there are two main routes to OA: publishing in OA journals (gold OA) or archiving of article copies or manuscripts at other web locations (green OA). This study focuses on summarizing and extending current knowledge about green OA. A synthesis of previous studies indicates that green OA coverage of all published journal articles is approximately 12%, with substantial disciplinary variation. Typically, green OA copies become available after considerable time delays, partly caused by publisher-imposed embargo periods, and partly by author tendencies to archive manuscripts only periodically. Although green OA copies should ideally be archived in proper repositories, a large share is stored on home pages and similar locations, with no assurance of long-term preservation. Often such locations contain exact copies of published articles, which may infringe on the publisher's exclusive rights. The technical foundation for green OA uploading is becoming increasingly solid largely due to the rapid increase in the number of institutional repositories. The number of articles within the scope of OA mandates, which strongly influence the self-archival rate of articles, is nevertheless still low.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Björk","given":"Bo-Christer"},{"family":"Laakso","given":"Mikael"},{"family":"Welling","given":"Patrik"},{"family":"Paetau","given":"Patrik"}],"citation-key":"bjork2014","container-title":"Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology","DOI":"10.1002/asi.22963","ISSN":"2330-1643","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","page":"237-250","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Anatomy of green open access","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.22963","volume":"65"},

  {"id":"blackler1995","abstract":"There is current interest in the competitive advantage that knowledge may provide for organizations and in the significance of knowledge workers, organ izational competencies and knowledge-intensive firms. Yet the concept of knowledge is complex and its relevance to organization theory has been insuf ficiently developed. The paper offers a review and critique of current approaches, and outlines an alternative. First, common images of knowledge in the organizational literature as embodied, embedded, embrained, encultured and encoded are identified and, to summarize popular writings on knowledge work, a typology of organizations and knowledge types is constructed. How ever, traditional assumptions about knowledge, upon which most current speculation about organizational knowledge is based, offer a compartmental ized and static approach to the subject. Drawing from recent studies of the impact of new technologies and from debates in philosophy, linguistics, social theory and cognitive science, the second part of the paper introduces an altern ative. Knowledge (or, more appropriately, knowing) is analyzed as an active process that is mediated, situated, provisional, pragmatic and contested. Rather than documenting the types of knowledge that capitalism currently demands the approach suggests that attention should be focused on the (culturally located) systems through which people achieve their knowing, on the changes that are occurring within such systems, and on the processes through which new knowledge may be generated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Blackler","given":"Frank"}],"citation-key":"blackler1995","container-title":"Organization Studies","container-title-short":"Organization Studies","DOI":"10.1177/017084069501600605","ISSN":"0170-8406","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1021-1046","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Knowledge, Knowledge Work and Organizations: An Overview and Interpretation","title-short":"Knowledge, Knowledge Work and Organizations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/017084069501600605","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"bleicher2015","abstract":"The circumalpine lake side settlements are a unique source of detailed information on the past. Nevertheless, little has been published by now on why the organic matter (fumier lacustre) in these settlements has been preserved and how exactly this happened. It is, therefore, necessary to closely explore the decomposition of organic matter under different conditions. We present data from the literature and a decomposition model simulating the outcome of different archaeological hypotheses and comparing the result with the actual archaeological record. We conclude that different scenarios of deposition should result in clearly discernible and measurable features in the archaeological record, whose presence or absence allows deducing the mode of deposition. The best conditions of organic preservation are to be expected under such conditions where a large organic input happens in shallow still water. Seasonal flooding and a later rise in lake level can also result in good preservation but imply a greater loss through mechanical erosion and in many cases clear preservation gradients within the deposits. The theoretical outcomes presented here find clear analogs in the archaeological record.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Bleicher","given":"Niels"},{"family":"Schubert","given":"Carsten"}],"citation-key":"bleicher2015","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2015.06.010","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,1]]},"page":"277-286","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Why are they still there?

Although the number of students who complete archaeology and anthropology degrees is relatively small in the United States and worldwide, programs and courses in such fields offer any student important opportunities in active, interdisciplinary learning that contribute to effective problem-solving using multiple lines of information. Courses and learning activities can question stereotypes depicting archaeology as a “useless” discipline (Arendt 2013:79), and they can prepare students to engage in and adapt to countless personal and professional situations while also learning about archaeology, its benefits, and its potential for relationships with similar and different fields. Therefore, the active learning of multimethod, interdisciplinary archaeology can prepare college-level students to address change and uncertainty in their homes, communities, and professions., Discuto mis experiencias en usar la arqueología y la antropología para enseñar a estudiantes de nivel universitario cómo ser personas que piensan y actúan de manera interdisciplinaria. Aunque la cantidad de estudiantes que cumplen títulos en arqueología y antropología sea relativamente pequeña en los EE UU y mundialmente, tales programas y cursos ofrecen a cualquier estudiante oportunidades importantes de aprendizaje activo e interdisciplinario que contribuyen a la resolución eficaz de problemas utilizando múltiples líneas de información. Los cursos y actividades de aprendizaje pueden cuestionar estereotipos que pintan la arqueología como disciplina “inútil” (Arendt 2013:79), y pueden preparar estudiantes para participar en y adaptarse a innumerables situaciones personales y profesionales mientras aprenden de arqueología, sus beneficios, y su potencial para relaciones con ámbitos similares y diferentes. Por lo tanto, el aprendizaje activo de la arqueología interdisciplinaria de métodos múltiples puede preparar estudiantes del nivel universitario para abordar el cambio e incertidumbre en sus hogares, comunidades, y profesiones.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Blouet","given":"Helen"}],"citation-key":"blouet2020","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2019.41","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2]]},"language":"en","page":"15-24","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Teaching Interdisciplinary Archaeology: Our Students as Our Future Agents of Change","title-short":"Teaching Interdisciplinary Archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/teaching-interdisciplinary-archaeology-our-students-as-our-future-agents-of-change/0963A738D715917370406BF064A2AD32","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"bollwerk2015","abstract":"Simon (2010:187) notes that the purpose of co-creative community projects is “to give voice and be responsive to the needs and interests of local community members; to provide a place for community engagement and dialogue; and to help participants develop skills that will support their own individual and community goals.” This paper explores the role that co-creation currently plays in digital public archaeology and discusses how co-creative methods can inform broader archaeological digital engagement efforts. It begins by placing co-creation in its proper context in order to demonstrate its unique characteristics, its value, and how it complicates approaches used in other types of archaeological engagement projects, such as Open Access initiatives. The discussion then turns to evaluating its impact and the broader need to measure success in digital public engagement projects. A discussion of research from the archaeology and the cultural heritage sectors provides examples of evaluation metrics and methods for assessing digital public archaeology projects. The paper concludes by suggesting that all digital engagement projects can benefit from incorporating some of the principles that are inherently part of co-creative methods but that not all archaeological digital engagement projects should strive to be completely co-creative.\n, \nSimon (2010:187) señala que, “el propósito de los proyectos comunitarios en colaboración es el de “dar voz y ser sensible a las necesidades e intereses de los miembros de la comunidad local; proveer un espacio de participación y diálogo a la comunidad; y ayudar a los participantes a desarrollar habilidades que les permitan lograr sus metas individuales y comunitarias”. Este trabajo explora el papel que juega actualmente la creación en colaboración en la arqueología pública digital y discute como sus métodos amplían los esfuerzos del compromiso arqueológico digital. Este mismo comienza ubicando a la creación en colaboración en su propio contexto para demonstrar sus características únicas, su valor, y cómo dificulta los enfoques utilizados en otros tipos de proyectos de participación arqueológica, tales como las iniciativas de Acceso Abierto. Habiendo demostrado el significado de la creación en colaboración, la discusión se torna hacia la evaluación de su impacto y en un sentido más amplio medir el éxito de los proyectos de participación pública digital. Una discusión académica desde la arqueología y los sectores del patrimonio cultural proveen indicadores y métodos de evaluación para la revisión de los proyectos de arqueología pública digital. Este trabajo concluye, sugiriendo que todos los proyectos de participación pueden beneficiarse de la incorporación de algunos principios inherentes a los métodos de creación en colaboración, pero que no todos los proyectos de participación en arqueología digital deben esforzarse para lograr ser completamente de creación en colaboración.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Bollwerk","given":"Elizabeth"}],"citation-key":"bollwerk2015","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.7183/2326-3768.3.3.223","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",8]]},"language":"en","page":"223-234","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Co-Creation’s Role in Digital Public Archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/cocreations-role-in-digital-public-archaeology/9213F22B1FA891D11262BE3F49376C0E","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"bollwerk2015a","abstract":"This paper serves a dual purpose. First it is an introduction that aims to frame a set of papers that describe and discuss the process of co-creation in a variety of archaeological projects. We discuss the challenge of community engagement in public archaeology and offer co-creative practice as a method for improving our relationships with descendant communities and the general public. We begin by providing a definition of public archaeology and a brief overview of its evolution over the last few decades. Second, we discuss co-creation’s origins and utilization in the museum and business sectors, where the process is applied to address challenges similar to those archaeologists face. We then demonstrate how co-creation fits into the public/applied archaeological framework. We argue that co-creation must be both co (that is, share power in some way) and creative (that is, not just do the same things better, but do something new). Within this framework, we discuss how co-creation aligns with and informs current trends in public archaeology practice drawing from the case studies included in this issue. We conclude that co-creation has an important place on the collaborative continuum and can help our discipline become more responsive to the needs of our many publics.\n, \nEste trabajo tiene un doble propósito. Primero, se trata de una introducción que tiene como objetivo enmarcar este conjunto de trabajos que describen y analizan el proceso de la “creación en colaboración” en una variedad de proyectos arqueológicos. Primero, discutimos el desafío de la participación comunitaria en la arqueología pública y ofrece la práctica de la creación en colaboración como un método para mejorar nuestras relaciones con las comunidades de afro descendientes y el público en general. Comenzamos por dar una definición de arqueología pública y una breve descripción de su evolución en las últimas décadas. En segundo lugar, discutimos los orígenes de la creación en colaboración y su uso en el museo y en los sectores de negocios, donde el proceso se implementa para enfrentar retos similares a los de los arqueólogos. A continuación, demostramos como la creación en colaboración se inscribe en el marco de la arqueología pública/aplicada. Debatimos que la creación en colaboración debe ser tanto en colaboración (es decir, compartir de alguna forma el poder) y creativa (es decir, no sólo hacer las mismas cosas de mejor forma, sino hacer algo nuevo). Dentro de este marco, debatimos como la creación en colaboración informa y se alinea con las tendencias actuales en la práctica de la arqueología pública a partir de los estudios de caso que se incluyen en este número. Concluimos que la creación en colaboración tiene un lugar importante en la continuidad de la colaboración y puede ayudar a nuestra disciplina a ser más receptiva a las necesidades de nuestros muchos públicos.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Bollwerk","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Connolly","given":"Robert"},{"family":"McDavid","given":"Carol"}],"citation-key":"bollwerk2015a","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.7183/2326-3768.3.3.178","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",8]]},"language":"en","page":"178-187","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Co-Creation and Public Archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/cocreation-and-public-archaeology/962FE8FAE767BF1D9CFB3BA91D2F19EB","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"bonnier2019","abstract":"The use of archaeological survey data for evaluation of landscape dynamics has commonly been concerned with the distribution of settlements and changes in number of recorded sites over time. Here we present a new quantitative approach to survey-based legacy data, which allows further assessments of the spatial configuration of possible land-use areas. Utilizing data from an intensive archaeological survey in the Berbati-Limnes area, Greece, we demonstrate how GIS-based kernel density estimations (KDE) can be used to produce cluster-based density surfaces that may be linked to past land-use strategies. By relating density surfaces to elevation and slope, it is also possible to quantify shifts in the use of specific environments on a regional scale, allowing us to model and visualize land-use dynamics over time. In this respect, the approach provides more multifaceted information to be drawn from archaeological legacy data, providing an extended platform for research on human-environment interactions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Bonnier","given":"Anton"},{"family":"Finné","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Weiberg","given":"Erika"}],"citation-key":"bonnier2019","container-title":"Journal of Field Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00934690.2019.1570481","ISSN":"0093-4690","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,17]]},"page":"70-83","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Examining Land-Use through GIS-Based Kernel Density Estimation: A Re-Evaluation of Legacy Data from the Berbati-Limnes Survey","title-short":"Examining Land-Use through GIS-Based Kernel Density Estimation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00934690.2019.1570481","volume":"44"},

  {"id":"borake2019","abstract":"A general interest in centralized institutions, state formation and prestige objects has dominated research on social organization and dynamics in Scandinavia from the Late Iron Age to the Middle Ages. Accordingly, a focus on kingly power, aristocratic influence, hierarchies and warrior might has dominated archaeological research designs for the last forty years. Subsequently, other perspectives have been evaded and their significance has been diminished. In this article, I use anarchistic principles as an analytic perspective and present examples of anarchistic actions – network organization, justified leaders and decentralization – drawing on well-known but ambiguous phenomena such as thing sites, the southern Danish defence system Danevirke, and migration and mobility. I suggest a perspective that recognizes resistance, authority and decentralization as well as centralization and institutionalization, allowing a broad spectrum of social engagement and interrelations to influence social organization. I will argue that human intentionality has been overlooked in favour of structures and institutions, and that the power of network organization and decentralization is influential in shaping social organization and dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Borake","given":"Trine Louise"}],"citation-key":"borake2019","container-title":"Archaeological Dialogues","DOI":"10.1017/s1380203819000151","ISSN":"1380-2038, 1478-2294","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12]]},"language":"en","page":"61-73","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Anarchistic action.

  {"id":"bordignon2022","abstract":"Data is one of the most used terms in scientific vocabulary. This article focusses on the relationship between data and research by analyzing the contexts of occurrence of the word data in a corpus of 72,471 research articles (1980–2012) from two distinct fields (Social sciences, Physical sciences). The aim is to shed light on the issues raised by research on data, namely the difficulty of defining what is considered as data, the transformations that data undergo during the research process and how they gain value for researchers who hold them. Relying on the distribution of occurrences throughout the texts and over time, it demonstrates that the word data mostly occurs at the beginning and at the end of research articles. Adjectives and verbs accompanying the noun data turn out to be even more important than data itself in specifying data. The increase in the use of possessive pronouns at the end of the articles reveals that authors tend to claim ownership of their data at the very end of the research process. Our research demonstrates that even if data handling operations are increasingly frequent, they are still described with imprecise verbs that do not reflect the complexity of these transformations.https://publons.com/publon/10.1162/qss_a_00220","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Bordignon","given":"Frédérique"},{"family":"Maisonobe","given":"Marion"}],"citation-key":"bordignon2022","container-title":"Quantitative Science Studies","container-title-short":"Quantitative Science Studies","DOI":"10.1162/qss_a_00220","ISSN":"2641-3337","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,10]]},"page":"1-27","source":"Silverchair","title":"Researchers and their data.

  {"id":"borgman2012","abstract":"We must all accept that science is data and that data are science, and thus provide for, and justify the need for the support of, much-improved data curation. (Hanson, Sugden, & Alberts, ) Researchers are producing an unprecedented deluge of data by using new methods and instrumentation. Others may wish to mine these data for new discoveries and innovations. However, research data are not readily available as sharing is common in only a few fields such as astronomy and genomics. Data sharing practices in other fields vary widely. Moreover, research data take many forms, are handled in many ways, using many approaches, and often are difficult to interpret once removed from their initial context. Data sharing is thus a conundrum. Four rationales for sharing data are examined, drawing examples from the sciences, social sciences, and humanities: (1) to reproduce or to verify research, (2) to make results of publicly funded research available to the public, (3) to enable others to ask new questions of extant data, and (4) to advance the state of research and innovation. These rationales differ by the arguments for sharing, by beneficiaries, and by the motivations and incentives of the many stakeholders involved. The challenges are to understand which data might be shared, by whom, with whom, under what conditions, why, and to what effects. Answers will inform data policy and practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Borgman","given":"Christine L."}],"citation-key":"borgman2012","container-title":"Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology","container-title-short":"J Am Soc Inf Sci Tec","DOI":"10.1002/asi.22634","ISSN":"1532-2890","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1059-1078","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The conundrum of sharing research data","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.22634/abstract","volume":"63"},

Responsibility for fulfilling data sharing requirements tends to fall on principal investigators, whereas it takes a village of stakeholders to construct, manage, and sustain the necessary knowledge infrastructure for disseminating data products. Individual scientists have mixed incentives, and many disincentives to share data, all of which vary by research domain, methods, resources, and other factors. Motivations and investments for data sharing also vary widely among academic institutional stakeholders such as university leadership, research computing, libraries, and individual schools and departments. Stakeholder concerns are interdependent along many dimensions, seven of which are explored: what data to share; context and credit; discovery; methods and training; intellectual property; data science programs; and international tensions. Data sharing is not a simple matter of individual practice, but one of infrastructure, institutions, and economics. Governments, funding agencies, and international science organizations all will need to invest in commons approaches for data sharing to develop into a sustainable international ecosystem.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Borgman","given":"Christine L."},{"family":"Bourne","given":"Philip E."}],"citation-key":"borgman2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2109.01694","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,4]]},"number":"arXiv:2109.01694","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Why it takes a village to manage and share data","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01694"},

We expect demands for open data in scholarly publishing to accelerate, at least partly in response to the opacity of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms.

The current state of open data in scholarly publishing is in transition from ‘nice to have’ to ‘need to have.’ Research data are valuable, interpretable, and verifiable only in context of their origin, and with sufficient infrastructure to facilitate reuse. Making research data useful is expensive; benefits and costs are distributed unevenly. Open data also poses risks for provenance, intellectual property, misuse, and misappropriation in an era of trolls and hallucinating AI algorithms.

Open science policies focus on data release rather than on data reuse, yet reuse is also difficult, expensive, and may never occur. Investments in data management could be made more wisely by considering who might reuse data, how, why, for what purposes, and when. Data creators cannot anticipate all possible reuses or reusers; our goal is to identify factors that may aid stakeholders in deciding how to invest in research data, how to identify potential reuses and reusers, and how to improve data exchange processes. Drawing upon empirical studies of data sharing and reuse, we develop the theoretical construct of distance between data creator and data reuser, identifying six distance dimensions that influence the ability to transfer knowledge effectively: domain, methods, collaboration, curation, purposes, and time and temporality. These dimensions are primarily social in character, with associated technical aspects that can decrease - or increase - distances between creators and reusers. We identify the order of expected influence on data reuse and ways in which the six dimensions are interdependent. Our theoretical framing of the distance between data creators and prospective reusers leads to recommendations to four categories of stakeholders on how to make data sharing and reuse more effective: data creators, data reusers, data archivists, and funding agencies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Borgman","given":"Christine L."},{"family":"Groth","given":"Paul T."}],"citation-key":"borgman2024a","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2402.07926","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,5]]},"number":"arXiv:2402.07926","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"From Data Creator to Data Reuser: Distance Matters","title-short":"From Data Creator to Data Reuser","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07926"},

  {"id":"borjesson2020","abstract":"Digitalisation of research data and massive efforts to make it findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable has revealed that in addition to an eventual lack of description of the data itself (metadata), data reuse is often obstructed by the lack of information about the datamaking and interpretation (i.e. paradata). In search of the extent and composition of categories for describing processes, this article reviews a selection of standards and recommendations frequently referred to as useful for documenting archaeological visualisations. It provides insight into 1) how current standards can be employed to document provenance and processing history (i.e. paradata), and 2) what aspects of the processing history can be made transparent using current standards and which aspects are pushed back or hidden. The findings show that processes are often either completely absent or only partially addressed in the standards. However, instead of criticising standards for bias and omissions as if a perfect description of everything would be attainable, the findings point to the need for a comprehensive consideration of the space a standard is operating in (e.g. national heritage administration or international harmonisation of data). When a standard is used in a specific space it makes particular processes, methods, or tools transparent. Given these premises, if the standard helps to document what needs to be documented (e.g. paradata), and if it provides a type of transparency required in a certain space, it is reasonable to deem the standard good enough for that purpose.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Börjesson","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Sköld","given":"Olle"},{"family":"Huvila","given":"Isto"}],"citation-key":"borjesson2020","container-title":"Digital Culture & Society","DOI":"10.14361/dcs-2020-0210","ISSN":"2364-2122","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"191-220","publisher":"transcript Verlag","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"Paradata in Documentation Standards and Recommendations for Digital Archaeological Visualisations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.14361/dcs-2020-0210/html","volume":"6"},

MP3 blogs, like Napster and other forms of unauthorized reproduction, are better understood as cultural practices and artifacts when considered alongside piracy’s long history. The aesthetic consequences and possibilities of forms of expression that are also methods of distribution, are clarified by identifying and examining a tension that connects MP3 blogging to other practices of unauthorized use: that is, the persistence of romantic ideals of creativity, authenticity and authorship even while seeming to deny and disregard them. By acknowledging the poetics of piracy practices (including the aesthetic character of distribution and replication) we can begin to understand how new authenticities build up around networked expression and how the meaning of networked forms of expression, formats, practices and artifacts can change over time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Borschke","given":"Margie"}],"citation-key":"borschke2014","container-title":"First Monday","DOI":"1593459774","ISSN":"13960466","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",10,5]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c)","source":"journals.uic.edu","title":"The new romantics: Authenticity, participation and the aesthetics of piracy","title-short":"The new romantics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/5549","volume":"19"},
  {"id":"bosch2017","abstract":"Recent studies have shown that the use of aquatic resources has greater antiquity in hominin diets than previously thought. At present, it is unclear when hominins started to habitually consume marine resources. This study examines shellfish exploitation from a behavioural ecology perspective, addressing how and when past hunter-gatherers from the Levant used coastal resources for subsistence purposes. We investigate the seasonality of shellfish exploitation in the Levantine Upper Palaeolithic through oxygen isotope analysis on shells of the intertidal rocky shore mollusc Phorcus (Osilinus) turbinatus from the key site Ksâr ‘Akil (Lebanon). At this rockshelter, multi-layered archaeological deposits contained remains of both marine and terrestrial molluscs in relatively large quantities, which were consumed and used as tools and ornaments by the occupants of the site. Our results indicate that at the start of the Initial Upper Palaeolithic (IUP), there is no evidence for shellfish consumption. Humans started to take fresh shellfish to the rockshelter from the second half of the IUP onward, albeit in low quantities. During the Early Upper Palaeolithic (EUP) shellfish exploitation became increasingly frequent. Oxygen isotope data show that shellfish exploitation was practised in every season throughout most of the Upper Palaeolithic (UP), with an emphasis on the colder months. This suggests that coastal resources had a central role in early UP foraging strategies, rather than a seasonally restricted supplementary one. Year-round shellfish gathering, in turn, suggests that humans occupied the rockshelter at different times of the year, although not necessarily continuously. Our oxygen isotope data is complemented with broader-scale exploitation patterns of faunal resources, both vertebrate and invertebrate, at the site. The inclusion of coastal marine resources signifies a diversification of the human diet from the EUP onward, which is also observed in foraging practices linked to the exploitation of terrestrial fauna.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bosch","given":"Marjolein D."},{"family":"Mannino","given":"Marcello A."},{"family":"Prendergast","given":"Amy L."},{"family":"Wesselingh","given":"Frank P."},{"family":"O'Connell","given":"Tamsin C."},{"family":"Hublin","given":"Jean-Jacques"}],"citation-key":"bosch2017","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2017.08.014","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10,15]]},"source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Year-round shellfish exploitation in the Levant and implications for Upper Palaeolithic hunter-gatherer subsistence","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X17305862"},

This study systematically reviewed the relevant bioarchaeological, forensic, and paleopathological literature and identified ten criteria commonly used in diagnosing healing, depressed cranial fractures (HDCF). Bioarchaeological studies (n = 146) describing trauma were evaluated for the criteria used to diagnose HDCF. Results indicate that studies recording HDCF rarely consider >2–3 criteria. The most commonly scored features, lesion shape (63%), size (63%) and location (91%), can only be considered consistent with HDCF. Features diagnostic of HDCF, retention of concentric or radiating fracture lines, were only mentioned in 1% and 7% of the studies respectively. Even more problematic were contradictions in how criteria were applied across studies. Unclear, ambiguous, inconsistent or absent diagnostic criteria for HDCL is potentially causing an overestimation of nonlethal violence in the archaeological record.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Botham","given":"A.

  {"id":"bowker2000","abstract":"A revealing and surprising look at how classification systems can shape both worldviews and social interactions.What do a seventeenth-century mortality table (whose causes of death include \"fainted in a bath,\" \"frighted,\" and \"itch\"); the identification of South Africans during apartheid as European, Asian, colored, or black; and the separation of machine- from hand-washables have in common? All are examples of classification—the scaffolding of information infrastructures.In Sorting Things Out, Geoffrey C. Bowker and Susan Leigh Star explore the role of categories and standards in shaping the modern world. In a clear and lively style, they investigate a variety of classification systems, including the International Classification of Diseases, the Nursing Interventions Classification, race classification under apartheid in South Africa, and the classification of viruses and of tuberculosis.The authors emphasize the role of invisibility in the process by which classification orders human interaction. They examine how categories are made and kept invisible, and how people can change this invisibility when necessary. They also explore systems of classification as part of the built information environment. Much as an urban historian would review highway permits and zoning decisions to tell a city's story, the authors review archives of classification design to understand how decisions have been made. Sorting Things Out has a moral agenda, for each standard and category valorizes some point of view and silences another. Standards and classifications produce advantage or suffering. Jobs are made and lost; some regions benefit at the expense of others. How these choices are made and how we think about that process are at the moral and political core of this work. The book is an important empirical source for understanding the building of information infrastructures.","author":[{"family":"Bowker","given":"Geoffrey C."},{"family":"Star","given":"Susan Leigh"}],"citation-key":"bowker2000","ISBN":"978-0-262-26160-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",8,25]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"396","publisher":"MIT Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences","title-short":"Sorting Things Out","type":"book"},

  {"id":"bowker2014","abstract":"This book is the first to directly address the question of how to bridge what has been termed the \"great divide\" between the approaches of systems developers and those of social scientists to computer supported cooperative work--a question that has been vigorously debated in the systems development literature. Traditionally, developers have been trained in formal methods and oriented to engineering and formal theoretical problems; many social scientists in the CSCW field come from humanistic traditions in which results are reported in a narrative mode. In spite of their differences in style, the two groups have been cooperating more and more in the last decade, as the \"people problems\" associated with computing become increasingly evident to everyone.  The authors have been encouraged to examine, rigorously and in depth, the theoretical basis of CSCW. With contributions from field leaders in the United Kingdom, France, Scandinavia, Mexico, and the United States, this volume offers an exciting overview of the cutting edge of research and theory. It constitutes a solid foundation for the rapidly coalescing field of social informatics.   Divided into three parts, this volume covers social theory, design theory, and the sociotechnical system with respect to CSCW. The first set of chapters looks at ways of rethinking basic social categories with the development of distributed collaborative computing technology--concepts of the group, technology, information, user, and text. The next section concentrates more on the lessons that can be learned at the design stage given that one wants to build a CSCW system incorporating these insights--what kind of work does one need to do and how is understanding of design affected? The final part looks at the integration of social and technical in the operation of working sociotechnical systems. Collectively the contributors make the argument that the social and technical are irremediably linked in practice and so the \"great divide\" not only should be a thing of the past, it should never have existed in the first place.","author":[{"family":"Bowker","given":"Geoffrey"}],"citation-key":"bowker2014","ISBN":"978-1-317-77876-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",5,12]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"495","publisher":"Psychology Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Social Science, Technical Systems, and Cooperative Work: Beyond the Great Divide","title-short":"Social Science, Technical Systems, and Cooperative Work","type":"book"},

The opportunities afforded by maturing digital techniques allowed fundamental rethinking of field and laboratory practice paradigms. A number of normally unquestioned aspects of archaeological praxis were examined with the goal of reorganizing information dynamics. Instead of a series of disparate processes in the field and field laboratory and during study and publication phases, a heterarchically-organized common information framework bonded all aspects of work traditionally only brought together in post-excavation processing, replacing disparate datasets and encompassing ongoing processes such as excavation recording, finds processing, and final analyses. Recording uses a common interface based on the iDig iPad app, and analyses use 3D GIS, based on comprehensive photogrammetry and an underlying all-encompassing data engine.

Today archaeology finds itself less able than ever to proclaim its relevance to the modern world. This volume foregrounds the relevance of the scholarship of John Barrett to this crisis. Twenty-four writers representing three generations of archaeologists scrutinise the current turmoil in the discipline and highlight the resolutions that may be found through Barrett's analytical framework. Topics include archaeology and the senses, the continuing problem of the archaeological record, practice, discourse, and agency, reorienting archaeological field practice, the question of different expressions of human diversity, and material ecologies.

  {"id":"brami2022","abstract":"This article presents the results of a 2021 international online survey of 419 early career researchers in archaeology. Respondents were passionate about pursuing an academic career, but pessimistic about job and career prospects. Statistics highlight specific obstacles, especially for women, from unstable employment to inequitable practices, and a chronic lack of support. Over 180 open-ended comments reveal worrying levels of workplace bullying and discrimination, particularly targeting women and minorities. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on early career researchers is also examined. The survey's findings are analysed and contextualized within the international higher education sector. A communal effort is necessary to create sustained change, but early career researchers remain hopeful that change can be implemented., Cet article présente les résultats d'un sondage en ligne conduit en 2021 à échelle internationale, auquel 419 jeunes archéologues chercheurs ont répondu. Ils tiennent ardemment à poursuivre une carrière universitaire ou de chercheur mais sont pessimistes quant à leurs perspectives professionnelles. Les statistiques révèlent des obstacles spécifiques, affectant surtout les femmes, tels que les emplois à statut précaire, les pratiques inéquitables et un manque chronique de soutien. Plus de 180 commentaires libres exposent un niveau inquiétant d'intimidation et de discrimination en milieu professionnel visant particulièrement les femmes et les minorités. L’étude considère également les effets de la pandémie de COVID-19 sur les chercheurs en début de carrière. Les résultats du sondage, analysés dans le contexte de l'enseignement supérieur, indiquent qu'il faut un effort concerté pour produire un changement durable dans les conditions de travail des jeunes chercheurs. Ces derniers restent cependant optimistes quant aux chances de succès d'une telle initiative.

Die Statistiken weisen auf bestimmte Hindernisse wie prekäre Arbeitsbedingungen, ungerechte Verfahren und mangelnde Unterstützung, besonders bei Frauen. Über 180 offene Kommentare offenbaren eine besorgniserregende Menge von Mobbing und Diskriminierungsfällen, vor allem an Frauen und Minderheiten gerichtet. Die Verfasser besprechen auch die Auswirkungen der COVID-19-Pandemie auf Nachwuchsforscher. Die Ergebnisse der Umfrage werden innerhalb des internationalen Hochschulwesens bewertet und kontextualisiert. Es ergibt sich, dass eine gemeinsame Leistung nötig ist, um die heutigen Verhältnisse nachhaltig zu ändern; die Nachwuchsforscher hoffen jedoch weiterhin, dass solche Veränderungen erfolgen können.

  {"id":"bratton2016","abstract":"What has planetary-scale computation done to our geopolitical realities? It takes different forms at different scales -- from energy and mineral sourcing and subterranean cloud infrastructure to urban software and massive universal addressing systems; from interfaces drawn by the augmentation of the hand and eye to users identified by self -- quantification and the arrival of legions of sensors, algorithms, and robots. Together, how do these distort and deform modern political geographies and produce new territories in their own image? In The Stack, Benjamin Bratton proposes that these different genres of computation -- smart grids, cloud platforms, mobile apps, smart cities, the Internet of Things, automation -- can be seen not as so many species evolving on their own, but as forming a coherent whole: an accidental megastructure called The Stack that is both a computational apparatus and a new governing architecture. We are inside The Stack and it is inside of us. In an account that is both theoretical and technical, drawing on political philosophy, architectural theory, and software studies, Bratton explores six layers of The Stack: Earth, Cloud, City, Address, Interface, User. Each is mapped on its own terms and understood as a component within the larger whole built from hard and soft systems intermingling -- not only computational forms but also social, human, and physical forces. This model, informed by the logic of the multilayered structure of protocol \"stacks,\" in which network technologies operate within a modular and vertical order, offers a comprehensive image of our emerging infrastructure and a platform for its ongoing reinvention. The Stack is an interdisciplinary design brief for a new geopolitics that works with and for planetary-scale computation. Interweaving the continental, urban, and perceptual scales, it shows how we can better build, dwell within, communicate with, and govern our worlds.thestack.org","author":[{"family":"Bratton","given":"Benjamin H."}],"citation-key":"bratton2016","edition":"1st","ISBN":"978-0-262-02957-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"publisher":"The MIT Press","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty","title-short":"The Stack","type":"book"},

  {"id":"bretzke2017","abstract":"Southwestern Asia plays an essential part in all models that have been developed to explain how and when modern humans colonized Eurasia. Given the rich record of Southwestern Asia and the long history of research, it is not surprising that the region provides an enormous wealth of information on the lifeways and population dynamics of prehistoric human groups. We argue here that many archaeological models oversimplify the processes of human dispersals and contractions by underestimating the importance of archaeological and paleoenvironmental records on the regional scale. Based on our surveys and excavations in southwest Syria, the Zagros Mountains, and southeast Arabia, we conclude that the different regions provide distinct records of population dynamics during the Late Pleistocene. This led us to conclude that dispersal processes should not be understood as simple unidirectional movements during well-defined windows of opportunity but rather as complex changes in human biogeography with different effects in different regions at different times. We see more promise for research on human dispersals by facing up to this complexity instead of simplifying the problem for the sake of achieving striking results of only schematic value.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Bretzke","given":"Knut"},{"family":"Conard","given":"Nicholas J."}],"citation-key":"bretzke2017","container-title":"Current Anthropology","container-title-short":"Current Anthropology","DOI":"10.1086/694077","ISSN":"0011-3204","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10,23]]},"page":"S000-S000","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Not Just a Crossroad: Population Dynamics and Changing Material Culture in Southwestern Asia during the Late Pleistocene","title-short":"Not Just a Crossroad","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/694077"},
  {"id":"briault2007","abstract":"Cretan peak sanctuaries have long attracted interest for their topographical characteristics, and several studies have emphasized the inter-visibility of groups of peak sanctuaries, and their location within sight of settlements and upland pastures. By contrast, it is argued here that, while the prominence of peak sanctuaries within the landscape clearly contributed to their wide and rapid spread as a type of ritual space, the location on a mountain peak may have been secondary to the cult objects and equipment used in structuring and transmitting the ritual practices that took place there. Using polythetic classification to determine the basic range of artefacts that constitutes a peak sanctuary-like assemblage, several non-mountain locations are identified at which ‘peak sanctuary’ rituals appear to have taken place, indicating that the idea of a peak sanctuary was locally adaptable and that visibility and landscape location were perhaps less important to peak sanctuary cult than traditionally supposed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Briault","given":"Camilla"}],"citation-key":"briault2007","container-title":"World Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00438240601136355","ISSN":"0043-8243","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",3,1]]},"page":"122-141","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Making mountains out of molehills in the Bronze Age Aegean: visibility, ritual kits, and the idea of a peak sanctuary","title-short":"Making mountains out of molehills in the Bronze Age Aegean","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00438240601136355","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"brouwerburg2017","abstract":"While the benefits of GIS are widely touted among archaeologists today, less attention has been paid to the potential pitfalls and drawbacks of this undeniably important methodological tool. One of the greatest challenges of geospatial modeling is unbalanced data: due to the nature of the archaeological record, we can never assume that the remnants of past behavioral processes we are working with constitute a fully representative sample. Rather, our datasets are reflective of differential social and natural preservation conditions, as well as research biases. Most regional geospatial studies must collate diverse data collected over decades by researchers with varying backgrounds and goals, using assorted spatial scales and levels of technological sophistication. Such factors contribute substantial uncertainty to our models, uncertainty that should be recognized, quantified, and mitigated. If GIS techniques are to continue shifting the way we conduct archaeology and improve our abilities to answer questions regarding past behavior, then we must question the infallibility of GIS as a methodological tool and direct more attention toward developing robust geospatial applications that can meet the idiosyncratic needs of archaeological analysis. This paper explores one example of how such uncertainty investigation can be conducted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Brouwer Burg","given":"Marieka"}],"citation-key":"brouwerburg2017","collection-title":"Archaeological GIS Today: Persistent Challenges, Pushing Old Boundaries, and Exploring New Horizons","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2017.05.010","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,1]]},"page":"115-120","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"It must be right, GIS told me so!

It considers the ways in which architecture, construction and reconstruction can serve as a temporal map, not just of relations between individual citizens and governments, but also as indicators of other oppositions that are subsumed by, or partially overlap with, that dichotomy. The focus of the chapter is on what might be called a speculative archaeology of sites in the neighbourhood of Krushevo, a town in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The history of Krushevo demonstrates how landscapes are always bound up with politics, not just for the states that seek to control them, but for the people who inhabit them. While most of the contributions to this book are offered by professional archaeologists, and describe the activities of professionals, this chapter deals with the involvement of local communities with the landscape and its meaning. It thus seeks to take an ethnographic approach to the social relations within a state which are built around the landscape.","author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"K.

Connecting funding information, datasets, and other essential research information to individuals and their work is still done manually at great expense in time and effort. Given that one of the greatest benefits of the modern web is the rich array of links between digital objects and related resources that it enables, this is a significant failure. The ability to connect, discover, and access resources is the underpinning premise of open research, so tools to enable this, themselves open, are vital. The increasing adoption of resolvable, persistent identifiers for people, digital objects, and research information offers a means of providing these missing connections. This article describes some of the ways that identifiers can help to unlock the potential of open research, focusing on the Open Researcher and Contributor Identifier (ORCID), a person identifier that also serves to link other identifiers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Josh"},{"family":"Demeranville","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Meadows","given":"Alice"}],"citation-key":"brown2016","container-title":"Publications","DOI":"10.3390/publications4040030","ISSN":"2304-6775","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"4","page":"30","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Open Access in Context: Connecting Authors, Publications and Workflows Using ORCID Identifiers","title-short":"Open Access in Context","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-6775/4/4/30","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"brown2018","abstract":"We used portable X-ray fluorescence analysis to perform elemental analysis of 111 obsidian artefacts from 32 Neolithic and two Late Neolithic/Bronze Age sites in the Tavoliere, Italy. This is the first detailed regional Neolithic study of obsidian in Italy. By comparing the elemental compositions with those of Mediterranean obsidian sources, we identified the Gabellotto of Lipari as the source for 99 artefacts and Palmarola as source for twelve artefacts. Within the Tavoliere, the Palmarola obsidian had a more westerly distribution, whereas the Lipari obsidian is more generally distributed. This pattern probably reflects the geographical origin of the obsidian and the trade and exchange networks necessary to bring material to the Tavoliere over land from the west. The obsidian pieces have very few or no signs of use-wear, implying that they may have been used only a few times, or even just once. We suggest that such limited use implies a role for obsidian in special rituals involving rites de passage such as cutting the umbilical cord of newborns or circumcision of boys.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Keri A."},{"family":"Tykot","given":"Robert H."}],"citation-key":"brown2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2018.04.035","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,1]]},"page":"284-292","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Obsidian in the Tavoliere, Southeastern Italy — A regional study","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18301172","volume":"20"},

She shows how contemporary surveillance technologies and practices are informed by the long history of racial formation and by the methods of policing black life under slavery, such as branding, runaway slave notices, and lantern laws. Placing surveillance studies into conversation with the archive of transatlantic slavery and its afterlife, Browne draws from black feminist theory, sociology, and cultural studies to analyze texts as diverse as the methods of surveilling blackness she discusses: from the design of the eighteenth-century slave ship Brooks, Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon, and The Book of Negroes, to contemporary art, literature, biometrics, and post-9/11 airport security practices. Surveillance, Browne asserts, is both a discursive and material practice that reifies boundaries, borders, and bodies around racial lines, so much so that the surveillance of blackness has long been, and continues to be, a social and political norm.","author":[{"family":"Browne","given":"Simone"}],"citation-key":"browne2015","ISBN":"978-0-8223-7530-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,7]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"137","publisher":"Duke University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness","title-short":"Dark Matters","type":"book"},
  {"id":"bruck2005","abstract":"In recent years the development of a phenomenological archaeology has provoked considerable discussion within the discipline, particularly within British prehistory. This paper provides a review of this challenging body of research, outlining its problems and potentials and setting it within its broader disciplinary context. Phenomenology has been used to great effect to critique the Cartesian rationalism inherent in traditional archaeological approaches, encouraging imaginative and valuable reinterpretations of the architecture and landscape settings of different monuments. Nonetheless, there are a number of significant problems raised by this work. The suggestion that the archaeologist’s embodied engagement with an ancient monument or landscape can provide an insight into past experiences and interpretations is critically considered. The epistemological status of the knowledge-claims made, including how and whether the patterns identified should be verified, is discussed. The contribution of phenomenology to postprocessual debates surrounding concepts of the self, the individual, embodiment and emotion are also explored. The work of key proponents of phenomenology such as Tilley and Thomas provides a particular focus, although a range of other authors are also considered.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Brück","given":"Joanna"}],"citation-key":"bruck2005","container-title":"Archaeological Dialogues","DOI":"10.1017/S1380203805001583","ISSN":"1478-2294, 1380-2038","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",6]]},"page":"45-72","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Experiencing the past?

However, these archaeological applications share a number of issues concerning 1) the role of archaeological data in networks; 2) the diversity of network structures, their consequences and their interpretation; 3) the critical use of quantitative tools; and 4) the influence of other disciplines, especially sociology. This article concerns a deconstruction of past archaeological methods for examining networks. Through a case study of Roman table wares in the eastern Mediterranean, the article highlights a number of issues with network analysis as a method for archaeology. It urges caution regarding the uncritical application of network analysis methods developed in other disciplines and applied to archaeology. However, it stresses the potential benefits of network analysis for the archaeological discipline and acknowledges the need for specifically archaeological network analysis, which should be based on relational thinking and can be expanded with an archaeological toolset for quantitative analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Brughmans","given":"Tom"}],"citation-key":"brughmans2010","container-title":"Oxford Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1468-0092.2010.00349.x","ISSN":"1468-0092","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"277-303","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Connecting the Dots: Towards Archaeological Network Analysis","title-short":"Connecting the Dots","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0092.2010.00349.x/abstract","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"brughmans2013a","abstract":"This review aims to expose the potential of formal network methods for archaeology by tracing the origins of the academic traditions, network models, and techniques that have been most influential to archaeologists. A brief discussion of graph theoretic applications in archaeology reveals how graph visualization and analysis was used since the 1960s in a very similar way to later network analysis applications, but did not seem to have influenced the more widespread adoption of network techniques over the past decade. These recent archaeological applications have been strongly influenced by two academic traditions, social network analysis and sociophysics. The most influential and promising techniques and models adopted from these traditions are critically discussed. This review reveals some general trends which are considered to be the result of two critical issues that will need to be addressed in future archaeological network analysis: (1) a general unawareness of the historicity and diversity of formal network methods both within and outside the archaeological discipline has resulted in a very limited methodological scope; (2) the adoption or development of network methods has very rarely been driven by specific archaeological research questions and is dominated by a few popular models and techniques, which has in some cases resulted in a routinized explanatory process. This review illustrates, however, the great potential of formal network methods for archaeology and argues that, if this potential is to be applied in a critical way, a broad multidisciplinary scope is necessary and specific archaeological research contexts should dominate applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Brughmans","given":"Tom"}],"citation-key":"brughmans2013a","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-012-9133-8","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"623-662","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Thinking Through Networks: A Review of Formal Network Methods in Archaeology","title-short":"Thinking Through Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-012-9133-8","volume":"20"},

This paper aims to contribute to the study of complex visual relational phenomena in landscape archaeology by proposing a range of visibility network patterns and methods. We propose first- and second-order visibility graph representations of total and cumulative viewsheds, and two-mode representations of cumulative viewsheds. We present network patterns that can be used to represent aspects of visibility theories, and that can be used in statistical simulation models to compare theorised networks with observed networks. We argue for the need to incorporate observed visibility network density in these simulation models, by illustrating strong differences in visibility network density in three example landscapes. The approach is illustrated through a brief case study of visibility networks of long barrows in Cranborne Chase.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Brughmans","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Brandes","given":"Ulrik"}],"citation-key":"brughmans2017","container-title":"Frontiers in Digital Humanities","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"brughmans2017a","abstract":"This paper presents a study of the visual properties of natural and Amerindian cultural landscapes in late pre-colonial East-Guadeloupe and of how these visual properties affected social interactions. Through a review of descriptive and formal visibility studies in Caribbean archaeology, it reveals that the ability of visual properties to affect past human behaviour is frequently evoked but the more complex of these hypotheses are rarely studied formally. To explore such complex hypotheses, the current study applies a range of techniques: total viewsheds, cumulative viewsheds, visual neighbourhood configurations and visibility networks. Experiments were performed to explore the control of seascapes, the functioning of hypothetical smoke signalling networks, the correlation of these visual properties with stylistic similarities of material culture found at sites and the change of visual properties over time. The results of these experiments suggest that only few sites in Eastern Guadeloupe are located in areas that are particularly suitable to visually control possible sea routes for short- and long-distance exchange; that visual control over sea areas was not a factor of importance for the existence of micro-style areas; that during the early phase of the Late Ceramic Age networks per landmass are connected and dense and that they incorporate all sites, a structure that would allow hypothetical smoke signalling networks; and that the visual properties of locations of the late sites Morne Souffleur and Morne Cybèle-1 were not ideal for defensive purposes. These results led us to propose a multi-scalar hypothesis for how lines of sight between settlements in the Lesser Antilles could have structured past human behaviour: short-distance visibility networks represent the structuring of navigation and communication within landmasses, whereas the landmasses themselves served as focal points for regional navigation and interaction. We conclude by emphasising that since our archaeological theories about visual properties usually take a multi-scalar landscape perspective, there is a need for this perspective to be reflected in our formal visibility methods as is made possible by the methods used in this paper.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Brughmans","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Waal","given":"Maaike S.","dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Hofman","given":"Corinne L."},{"family":"Brandes","given":"Ulrik"}],"citation-key":"brughmans2017a","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-017-9344-0","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",7,25]]},"language":"en","page":"1-45","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Exploring Transformations in Caribbean Indigenous Social Networks through Visibility Studies: the Case of Late Pre-Colonial Landscapes in East-Guadeloupe (French West Indies)","title-short":"Exploring Transformations in Caribbean Indigenous Social Networks through Visibility Studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-017-9344-0"},

The ability of archaeologists to record in the field, rather than offsite, has fundamentally changed the methods of observation, conceptualization, and interpretation of deposits. Focusing on the role of stratigraphy as the center of archaeological field work, Giorgio Buccellati examines the challenges of interpreting a 'broken tradition'; a civilization for which there are no living carriers today.

  {"id":"buchanan2016","abstract":"Archaeological curation is the process of managing objects and their documentation after their discovery in an excavation. It is an activity that occurs in the context of particular regulatory frameworks for archaeological conservation and historic preservation. Yet field archaeologists assert the continued presence of a “curation crisis” and collecting institutions are responding to ongoing dialogues for transparency in information about museum collections of antiquities, as upheld by the 1970 UNESCO Convention against looting and the sale of unprovenanced artifacts. Curators face an overwhelming volume of materials that demand curatorial attention in the form of provenance research, a pursuit which uses records and research generated during archaeological excavation fieldwork to construct a narrative of the object’s history from creation to display. Such provenance information supports the curation and public presentation of archaeological collections in museums, settings that currently bound our empirical understanding of curation. This dissertation finds that curation occurs in multiple settings but that curation activities are not well-coordinated. It examines the curation contributions of archaeologists and conservators, among other participants, that culminate in museum exhibition of objects. Fieldwork for this study occurred at four research sites including archaeological excavations (classical as well as contract and archival), a conservation lab, a curatorial facility or repository, and a state museum. The core findings of the study articulate archaeological curation as a discontinuum of distributed work, and the formation of the discontinuum through problematic data handoffs which arise from gaps in data interoperability and use purposes between four professional communities of practice. Handoffs between excavation, conservation, collections care, and exhibition activities impact the research potential of artifact collections – especially significant for museum archaeology practice and the public storytelling role. This provenance research study of work practices builds on archaeological, archival, and museum scholarship to articulate where, at these handoffs, separate communities of practice might collaboratively address archaeological curation issues. In positioning archaeological curation as a set of recordkeeping actions, this dissertation identifies opportunities for future research on coordination of data practices between multiple participants.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Buchanan","given":"Sarah Alix"}],"citation-key":"buchanan2016","DOI":"10.15781/T2PN8XJ3N","genre":"Thesis","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",8]]},"language":"english","title":"A provenance research study of archaeological curation","type":"thesis","URL":"https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/44000"},
  {"id":"buchanan2019","abstract":"The Peopling of the Americas was a multi-millennium process involving both the hunter-gatherer colonization of new landscapes as well as the ‘settling in’ to local environments. This process is typically identified archaeologically by an increase in the number of recognized point types, site frequency, changes in subsistence patterns, and increased geographic patterning in stone tool variation. Here, we add to this list by examining preferential toolstone use by Clovis and Folsom peoples, reasoning that Folsom groups formed stricter habits of toolstone procurement relative to Clovis people as the former pursued their increasingly familiar seasonal rounds. After generating lithic raw material data from 49 Folsom assemblages, we constructed a ‘Folsom lithic network’ that we compared to a ‘Clovis lithic network’, which consisted of 38 assemblages. Our results show that the Folsom lithic network is significantly denser than the Clovis lithic network. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Folsom people started to form regular habits of toolstone procurement relative to Clovis people. More broadly, our comparison of lithic networks further supports the hypothesis that the Clovis-to-Folsom transition represents the process of foragers increasingly adapting to their local resource distribution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Buchanan","given":"Briggs"},{"family":"Andrews","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Kilby","given":"J.

  {"id":"budd1995","abstract":"In this article we address the question of the emergence and development of copper and iron metallurgy in Eurasia in relation to a historical debate within archaeology and archaeometallurgy concerning appropriate technological scales and social organizational models. We believe that the concepts of large‐scale extraction and production and concomitant reconstruction of specialized activities and monoplex social roles that figure strongly in the prevailing, orthodox ‘industrial model’ are either underdetermined or unsupported by archaeological data. Such concepts represent an anachronistic back‐projection of the modern notion of technological change as driven by rational science. We suggest that ritual and magical dimensions need to be given a more central place in interpretation and hypothesis formulation, and we tentatively suggest a broad social‐developmental perspective that would incorporate them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Budd","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Timothy"}],"citation-key":"budd1995","container-title":"World Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00438243.1995.9980297","ISSN":"0043-8243","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995",6,1]]},"page":"133-143","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The faerie smith meets the bronze industry: Magic versus science in the interpretation of prehistoric metal-making","title-short":"The faerie smith meets the bronze industry","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00438243.1995.9980297","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"bustos-perez2019","abstract":"Many Paleolithic lithic collections are found in contexts where post-depositional alterations, such as those made by water streams or sedimentary displacement, have affected the surface of most of the lithic artifacts. A major alteration often observed is the rounding of lithic artifacts. Although there have been some proposals on how to classify degrees of rounding—usually by employing naked eye classifications to determine degrees of rounding—there is a lack of consensus among lithic analysts. The aim of this study is to define and characterize degrees of rounding among lithic artifacts. This characterization also takes into consideration the differential development of alterations and rounding stages, depending on the raw materials. Here, an experimental program has been developed along with supplementary archaeological analysis to define and characterize degrees of rounding. Degrees of rounding are characterized according to three criteria: surface alteration, edge alteration, and width of the ridges. A preliminary characterization and proposal of degrees of rounding is presented. This characterization also takes into consideration the raw materials and the sensibility and resolution of the criteria to establish degrees of rounding. Results show how, after microscopic analysis, lithic artifacts that appear fresh to the naked present different degrees of rounding. The conclusions explain that, although rounding is continuous process, it is possible to establish degrees of rounding, a main initial goal for any lithic analyst.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Bustos-Pérez","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"Díaz","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Baena","given":"Javier"}],"citation-key":"bustos-perez2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-018-9409-8","ISSN":"1573-7764","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1243-1275","source":"Springer Link","title":"An Experimental Approach to Degrees of Rounding Among Lithic Artifacts","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-018-9409-8","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"butts2013","abstract":"The burden of cancer for Canadian citizens and society is large. New technologies have the potential to increase the use of genetic information in clinical decision-making, furthering prevention, surveillance, and safer, more effective drug therapies for cancer patients. Personalized medicine can have different meanings to different people. The context for personalized medicine in the present paper is genetic testing, which offers the promise of refining treatment decisions for those diagnosed with chronic and life-threatening illnesses. Personalized medicine and genetic characterization of tumours can also give direction to the development of novel drugs. Genetic testing will increasingly become an essential part of clinical decision-making. In Canada, provinces are responsible for health care, and most have unique policies and programs in place to address cancer control. The result is inconsistency in access to and delivery of therapies and other interventions, beyond the differences expected because of demographic factors and clinical education. Inconsistencies arising from differences in resources, policy, and application of evidence-informed personalized cancer medicine exacerbate patient access to appropriate testing and quality care. Geographic variations in cancer incidence and mortality rates in Canada-with the Atlantic provinces and Quebec having higher rates, and British Columbia having the lowest rates-are well documented. Our purpose here is to provide an understanding of current and future applications of personalized medicine in oncology, to highlight the benefits of personalized medicine for patients, and to describe issues and opportunities for improvement in the coordination of personalized medicine in Canada. Efficient and more rapid adoption of personalized medicine in oncology in Canada could help overcome those issues and improve cancer prevention and care. That task might benefit from the creation of a National Genetics Advisory Panel that would review research and provide recommendations on tests for funding or reimbursement, guidelines, service delivery models, laboratory quality assurance, education, and communication. More has to be known about the current state of personalized cancer medicine in Canada, and strategies have to be developed to inform and improve understanding and appropriate coordination and delivery. Our hope is that the perspectives emphasized in this paper will stimulate discussion and further research to create a more informed response.","author":[{"family":"Butts","given":"C."},{"family":"Kamel-Reid","given":"S."},{"family":"Batist","given":"G."},{"family":"Chia","given":"S."},{"family":"Blanke","given":"C."},{"family":"Moore","given":"M."},{"family":"Sawyer","given":"M.

  {"id":"butzer1982","abstract":"Archaeology as Human Ecology is a new introduction to concepts and methods in archaeology. It deals not with artifacts, but with sites, settlements, and subsistence. Karl W. Butzer's goal is to interpret the ecosystem of which an archaeologicial site or site network was part. Components of this study include geo-archaeology, archaeobotany, zoo-archaeology, and archaeometry. These methods are then used in examining interactions between human communities and their biophysical environment: the impact of settlement on site formation and the effects of subsistence activities on plants, animals, soils, and overall landscape modification. Finally, the methods and theoretical approach, are applied to examine the processes of cultural change and continuity. The approach of Archaeology as Human Ecology goes far beyond traditional environmental archaeology, which is concerned with simple reconstruction. It provides a clear, systemic approach that immediately allows an assessment of interactions. For the first time, it attempts to develop a comprehensive spatial archaeology - one that is far more than derivative spatial analysis.","author":[{"family":"Butzer","given":"Karl W."}],"citation-key":"butzer1982","ISBN":"978-0-521-28877-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1982",5,31]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"386","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Archaeology as Human Ecology: Method and Theory for a Contextual Approach","title-short":"Archaeology as Human Ecology","type":"book"},

  {"id":"camara2024","abstract":"This paper presents a method to store information about megalithic monuments' building components as graph nodes in a knowledge graph (KG). As a case study we analyse the dolmens from the region of Pavia (Portugal). To build the KG, information has been extracted from unstructured data to populate a schema model based on the International Committee for Documentation - Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC-CRM). In order to prepare the archaeological monument's information for bulk loading, it was transformed into semi-structured data. While the semi-structured file was used to populate the classes with their respective properties and instances, the KG labels and types were defined using some of the entities and relations defined by the CIDOC-CRM. The knowledge-driven model was built to represent dolmens in a formal and structured manner using Neo4J, a property-graph database. Modeling a labeled property graph based on predefined labels as a KG enables to transform textual semantic data into instances and properties. Thus, we show that it is possible to represent at a granular level all the information about the structural components of monuments since heterogeneities, granularities, and large amounts of data can be handled by a KG. Therefore, a KG implemented using a native graph database can improve data storage and processing, making it interoperable either between humans, between humans and machines and machine-to-machine.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Câmara","given":"Ariele"},{"family":"Almeida","given":"Ana","dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"João"}],"citation-key":"camara2024","DOI":"10.5281/zenodo.10458251","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,4]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Zenodo","title":"Transforming the CIDOC-CRM model into a megalithic monument property graph","type":"speech","URL":"https://zenodo.org/records/10458251"},

  {"id":"campbell2004","abstract":"This dissertation is a joint dissertation, written by two people about the connectivity of two practices; archaeology and performance. Its contents focus upon the creation of a hybrid field of study that has only just begun to exist. We have named this dissertation ’BorderLine Archaeology’ because we feel that this title reveals the relevance of its position as a field of study that is geographically situated on the border, on the line where things and people meet, at a borderline which is in a constant state of negotiation and change. ’Border- Line Archaeology’ is the site that bridges the gap between art and academia; it is the meeting place where subjective experience has a central role in the exploration of alternative ways to approach archaeological objects in the context of belonging to a process of cultural production. The purpose of this dissertation is: to create a theoretical methodology of BorderLine Archaeology, that provides alternative strategies to use when dealing with archaeological matters; to explore the process of performative writing as an alternative approach in the re-presentation of the archaeological; to investigate archaeology’s potential as a mode performative cultural production and to produce a body of knowledge, a kind of archaeology that is theoretical yet practical, that is hybrid, sensorial, inter-subjective, multilayered and performative. The aims and objectives of this dissertation are approached through the co-authored chapters, ’Frontwords’, ’Framework’, ’Proposition’, ’Making our way’ and ’Afterwords’, where we set the context, create a theoretical methodology and sum up our work. But they are also approached through the production of two separate case-studies, where we implement the theoretical methodology of BorderLine Archaeology and use the process of performative writing in order to reveal its potential. In the casestudy ’Turning 180° into the walkscape of the labyrinth’ Fiona Campbell presents the labyrinths of Sweden and investigates how the act of moving affects the way we experience, perceive and represent the past-present. In the case-study ’Turning into the walkscape of the family’ Jonna Ulin deliberates the complexities of postmemory through an exploration of the family landscape as a site of the archaeological, as a site that needs to be interpreted through a process of reading onto and into. Both case-studies are connected to a co-produced website http://arkserv.arch.gu.se/ blalab, where the source materials for the separate projects are stored. The website provides additional perspectives to the written texts, inviting the visitor to explore further into the world of the Swedish labyrinths and the world of the family landscape. Some outcomes of this dissertation are; that the practice of BorderLine Archaeology is an embodied, inter-subjective process of reading, writing, interpreting and witnessing archaeological matters; that it is a practice of overlapping discourse, of crossing borders whilst moving the experiences of the participants onto and into the matters of everyday, into the place of the familiar, unfamiliar, the unspeakable, the silent, the same and the other.

  {"id":"campbell2007","abstract":"Archaeologists constantly work with chronologies, whether it is the explicit focus of study or not. Chronologies are used\nto order the past and to provide a framework within which social change can be discussed. It is clearly necessary to review and refine\nthe chronological structures as new information becomes available, and that is one of the purposes of this article. Chronologies are\nalso, however, artificial constructs, created by a partial understanding of the past and incorporating a range of assumptions, often\nunstated and unintended. Even the basic terms with which we use (Hassuna, Samarra, Halaf, Ubaid and so on) shape our view of the\npast. It is also necessary, therefore, to understand and question the assumptions and models on which chronologies are based. This\narticle focuses on the 7th to 5th millennia cal. BC in north Mesopotamia, a period that, in traditional terms, has the Halaf at its\ncentre, Hassuna/Samarra earlier, and Ubaid later. It draws attention to the underlying assumptions and distortions behind our previous\nchronological models, with explicit focus on how our understanding of past chronologies has been created and employed. A new,\nmore flexible approach to the chronology of this period will be proposed, which incorporates the most recent data and makes the link\nbetween chronology and the interpretation of past social change more explicit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Campbell","given":"Stuart"}],"citation-key":"campbell2007","container-title":"Paléorient","DOI":"10.3406/paleo.2007.5209","ISSN":"0153-9345","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"language":"eng","page":"103-136","source":"dialnet.unirioja.es","title":"Rethinking Halaf chronologies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2801191","volume":"33"},
  {"id":"campbell2017","abstract":"The presence of obsidian in the Near East has always evoked a response about its exotic nature and origins. It was not until 1960s, however, that this was put onto a scientific footing when Colin Renfrew and his collaborators began to explore obsidian in Turkey and the Mediterranean. Their characterisation of the sources allowed them to attribute artefacts to different sources and suggest models of dispersal and distribution. Since then considerably more artefacts have been attributed to sources, although mostly only small numbers from individual sites. This has led to various interpretations of how obsidian was obtained and used; new studies have considered least cost path analysis, network analysis and agent based modelling. Increasingly, new methods of provenancing of artefacts have also meant that large number of artefacts can be analysed relatively speedily and efficiently. Portable instruments allow data to be collected outside laboratories, avoiding restrictions imposed by export licenses or simplifying work on museum collections. Here we employ richness and diversity indexes to elucidate some of the patterns in obsidian source use and argue that there are several reasons why the provenancing of large proportions of assemblages will be critical in exploiting the true potential of obsidian studies in the Near East, even though the initial haphazard, small sample approach has been quite effective in sketching out the big picture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Campbell","given":"Stuart"},{"family":"Healey","given":"Elizabeth"}],"citation-key":"campbell2017","container-title":"Quaternary International","container-title-short":"Quaternary International","DOI":"10.1016/j.quaint.2017.09.023","ISSN":"1040-6182","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,10]]},"source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Diversity in obsidian use in the prehistoric and early historic Middle East","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618217308716"},

  {"id":"campbell2023","abstract":"The open-science movement seeks to make research more transparent and accessible. To that end, researchers are increasingly expected to share de-identified data with other scholars for review, reanalysis, and reuse. In psychology, open-science practices have been explored primarily within the context of quantitative data, but demands to share qualitative data are becoming more prevalent. Narrative data are far more challenging to de-identify fully, and because qualitative methods are often used in studies with marginalized, minoritized, and/or traumatized populations, data sharing may pose substantial risks for participants if their information can be later reidentified. To date, there has been little guidance in the literature on how to de-identify qualitative data. To address this gap, we developed a methodological framework for remediating sensitive narrative data. This multiphase process is modeled on common qualitative-coding strategies. The first phase includes consultations with diverse stakeholders and sources to understand reidentifiability risks and data-sharing concerns. The second phase outlines an iterative process for recognizing potentially identifiable information and constructing individualized remediation strategies through group review and consensus. The third phase includes multiple strategies for assessing the validity of the de-identification analyses (i.e., whether the remediated transcripts adequately protect participants’ privacy). We applied this framework to a set of 32 qualitative interviews with sexual-assault survivors. We provide case examples of how blurring and redaction techniques can be used to protect names, dates, locations, trauma histories, help-seeking experiences, and other information about dyadic interactions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Campbell","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Javorka","given":"McKenzie"},{"family":"Engleton","given":"Jasmine"},{"family":"Fishwick","given":"Kathryn"},{"family":"Gregory","given":"Katie"},{"family":"Goodman-Williams","given":"Rachael"}],"citation-key":"campbell2023","container-title":"Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science","DOI":"10.1177/25152459231205832","ISSN":"2515-2459","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"25152459231205832","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Open-Science Guidance for Qualitative Research: An Empirically Validated Approach for De-Identifying Sensitive Narrative Data","title-short":"Open-Science Guidance for Qualitative Research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/25152459231205832","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"canning","abstract":"Affective metadata for object experiences in the art museum explores the notion of affect as related to visitor experiences of artworks in a museum gallery setting, resulting in the specification of a data structure and knowledge organization system capable of methodically documenting these experiences. This proposed system presents an interdisciplinary view of museum object documentation that pushes the boundaries of what is conceptualized as object information worthy of documentation in order to adequately account for affective knowledge. Through an analysis of the literature – including affect and affect modeling, art museum information systems, and empirical aesthetics – and a visitor research study at the Art Gallery of Ontario, this thesis argues that affect needs to be considered as a salient dimension of art museum information infrastructures and metadata standards. One possible model for developing such a structure and corresponding standard is presented and validated using the results of this visitor research study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Canning","given":"Erin"}],"citation-key":"canning","event-place":"Canada","genre":"M.M.St.","ISBN":"9780438670556","language":"English","license":"Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","number-of-pages":"176","publisher":"University of Toronto (Canada)","publisher-place":"Canada","source":"ProQuest","title":"Affective Metadata for Object Experiences in the Art Museum","type":"thesis","URL":"https://www.proquest.com/docview/2138700165/abstract/7C14D6C86A32494CPQ/1"},

Using a data set of 47 specimens of raw materials, temper and finished products resulting from documented production sequences, our study demonstrates the range of clayey materials used by potters in the Falémé Valley and their possible identification in finished products. In addition, by systematically comparing the technical behavior with the compositional groups for the stages of the production sequence that vary (raw material procurement, clay preparation and firing), this study also shows the limits for interpretation of compositional groups in term of social-cultural aspects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Cantin","given":"N."},{"family":"Mayor","given":"A."}],"citation-key":"cantin2017","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2017.01.015","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,31]]},"source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Ethno-archaeometry in eastern Senegal: The connections between raw materials and finished ceramic products","title-short":"Ethno-archaeometry in eastern Senegal","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X17300172"},

Such increasingly myopic approaches have been criticized for their failure to address research questions framed by a large-scale, regional perspective and the analytical categories of ‘settle- ment’ and ‘site’.

  {"id":"carlson2014","abstract":"Digital imaging technologies have enhanced archaeological research and profoundly expanded the scale of the discipline’s potentialities. As illustrators and archaeologists move away from using hand-drawn images (of hand-held, real-life objects) to depict artifacts and other archaeological information, certain capabilities of the traditional illustrative process are lost. One such loss is the ability to present a complete and informed representation of an artifact free of the distortions and visual limitations that single-perspective (i.e., digital or photographic) imagery produces. This is accomplished by the illustrator through the unification of multiple views of the artifact from various perspectives into a single two-dimensional image that communicates to the viewer important attributes of the artifact, free of distortion and remaining true to the measured, analytical conventions of the illustrative process. Liberation from the single-viewpoint perspective was one of the fundamental elements of the Cubist movement. Traditional archaeological illustrators utilize Cubist principles to communicate visually to the viewer a complete, accurate, and undistorted package of information about an artifact. The supplanting of hand-drawn illustrations by digital images in today’s archaeological publications threatens to revert the visual representation of data back to uninformed, surficial “snapshots” of incomplete objects.\n, \nLas tecnologías de imágenes digitales han enaltecido los métodos de investigación arqueológica y ampliado abismalmente la escala de potenciales de la disciplina. Al alejarse los ilustradores y los arqueólogos de la representación de objetos dibujados a mano alzada, sosteniéndolos con la mano, inclusive de otro tipo de información arqueológica, se han perdido capacidades específicas del proceso clásico de la ilustración. Una de éstas es la capacidad de la ilustración para mostrar una representación completa e informada de un artefacto, sin las distorsiones y limitaciones visuales que introduce la perspectiva de un solo plano de las imágenes digitales o fotográficas. Esto se logra por el ilustrador a través de unificar las múltiples vistas de un artefacto desde varias perspectivas, en una imagen de dos dimensiones que comunica al observador los atributos importantes del artefacto sin distorsión alguna, permaneciendo fiel a las convenciones analíticas y mesuradas del proc so de ilustración. El liberarse de la perspec iva de un solo plano fue uno de los elementos fundamentales del movimiento cubista. Los ilustradores clásicos dentro de la arqueología utilizan los principios del movimiento cubista para comunicar al observador un paquete de información completo, preciso y sin distorsión en torno a un artefacto. La sustitución de ilustraciones hechas a mano por las imágenes digitales de las publicaciones arqueológicas amenaza con revertir la representación visual de los datos en una “instantánea” superficial, desinformada e incompleta de los objetos.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Carlson","given":"Eric S."}],"citation-key":"carlson2014","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.7183/2326-3768.2.4.269","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",11]]},"language":"en","page":"269-284","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Representation and Structure Conflict in the Digital Age: Reassessing Archaeological Illustration and the Use of Cubist Techniques in Depicting Images of the Past","title-short":"Representation and Structure Conflict in the Digital Age","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/representation-and-structure-conflict-in-the-digital-age/B757EB149FF1021735AF893443FCEC0D","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"carman2018","abstract":"Periodically archaeologists turn their gaze inwards towards their own field, to consider it as a craft activity or as a community of interest in its own right. The phrase ‘archaeological community’ is one widely used but rarely defined, and there is always a tendency towards the division of archaeology into a variety of distinct specialisms: yet one of the major aspects of academic life is in the construction of communities of shared interests. Here I draw upon my own experiences of encouraging others to become involved in efforts to develop those areas of enquiry that interest me. This includes the construction of formal networks but also more ‘covert’ activities by inserting contributions into conferences and sometimes publications where they may not have been initially welcomed. It was awkward and slightly dangerous work, especially early in my career, and I am not sure it always achieved what I intended.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Carman","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"carman2018","container-title":"Journal of Community Archaeology & Heritage","DOI":"10.1080/20518196.2017.1253208","ISSN":"2051-8196","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"45-54","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"‘Herding Cats’: Building Archaeological Communities","title-short":"‘Herding Cats’","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/20518196.2017.1253208","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"carter2017","abstract":"In our desire to develop public archaeologies at the early prehistoric site of Stélida (Naxos, Greece), we face three major challenges. Firstly, there are a number of stakeholder communities involved with conflicting interests. Moreover, the ‘local’ population is distinct, being heterogeneous in composition, fluid in its residence, including individuals with significantly more socioeconomic and political power than the archaeologists. Secondly, due to issues of landowners' wish for privacy and the Ministry of Culture's financial limitations, Stélida itself is unlikely to become a focus of public engagement; instead, off-site digital media, exhibitions and teaching packs likely represent the best means of disseminating information to larger audiences. Finally, early prehistoric archaeology is a culturally and temporally alien world of ‘bones and stones,’ which requires imaginative means of engaging the public imagination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Carter","given":"Tristan"}],"citation-key":"carter2017","container-title":"Journal of Eastern Mediterranean Archaeology & Heritage Studies","DOI":"10.5325/jeasmedarcherstu.5.3-4.0311","ISSN":"2166-3548","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"311-333","source":"JSTOR","title":"Nothing to See Here!

  {"id":"carter2017a","abstract":"This paper details the characterisation of 34 obsidian artefacts from Sha'ar Hagolan in the Jordan Valley, a major Pottery Neolithic Site of the southern Levantine Yarmukian culture (6400–6000 cal BCE). Employing an integrated approach that melds sourcing data from EDXRF spectroscopy with the artefacts’ techno-typological characteristics, we contrast Sha'ar Hagolan's lithic traditions with those of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic southern Levantine sites in the context of alleged socio-economic disruptions in the Pottery Neolithic. The results indicate that community's obsidian consumption habits largely followed deep-time regional traditions (with only the slightest decrease in relative quantities), i.e. the use of Cappadocian raw materials (Göllü Dağ and Nenezi Dağ) to make pressure blades, and occasional projectiles, with only a small proportion of eastern Anatolian products (Nemrut Dağ). While the Sha'ar Hagolan material seems to embody continuity of southern Levantine cultural tradition, other broadly contemporary assemblages attest to the initiation of new procurement networks, and novel modes of consumption that reflect the increasing degree of cultural heterogeneity of the period. Finally, the distribution of obsidian across the site does not support the idea that social distinction at Sha'ar Hagolan was part-based on the preferential access to these exotic resources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Carter","given":"Tristan"},{"family":"Batist","given":"Zachary"},{"family":"Campeau","given":"Kathryn"},{"family":"Garfinkel","given":"Yosef"},{"family":"Streit","given":"Katharina"}],"citation-key":"carter2017a","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10]]},"license":"All rights reserved","page":"305-317","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Investigating Pottery Neolithic socio-economic “regression” in the Southern Levant: Characterising obsidian consumption at Sha'ar Hagolan (N.

Using the notions of making, wayfaring, meshwork and agency, this discussion focuses on Ingold’s (2011) theoretical approach to these comments as a means for the construction of archaeological knowledge as applied to the 3D virtual landscape. It will demonstrate that 3D points, whether constructed or captured, can be considered to be agents within an actor network, have agency and are subject to memory and loss within the digital archaeological record. By their interconnections they become a meshwork that can exchange and retain unique attributes of materiality. As such, they challenge our notions of meaningmaking beyond the rote actions of visualizing within archaeology to a form that is more theoretically deeper. By viewing the construction and capture and the production of 3D or 2D visual data through a different lens but within theoretical archaeological terms, we can begin to understand our role in the creation of meaning within virtual archaeology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Carter","given":"William Michael"}],"citation-key":"carter2017c","container-title":"Virtual Archaeology Review","DOI":"10.4995/var.2017.6056","ISSN":"1989-9947","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",5,22]]},"language":"en","page":"97","source":"Crossref","title":"Getting to the point: making, wayfaring, loss and memory as meaning-making in virtual archaeology","title-short":"Getting to the point","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://polipapers.upv.es/index.php/var/article/view/6056","volume":"8"},

Using multiple lines of evidence, we show that phosphate measurement from small amounts of matrix from bucket-auger samples or cores is an inexpensive and replicable way to assess variability in the intensity of site use, conceptualized as a function of the scale, duration, and frequency of occupational events, between locations and over time. This method should be easily extended to other shell midden sites, especially where the majority of fine matrix is of anthropogenic origin.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Carter","given":"Kari"},{"family":"Cannon","given":"Aubrey"}],"citation-key":"carter2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2018.05.001","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,1]]},"page":"468-475","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Phosphate as an indicator of occupational intensity at shell midden sites on the central coast of British Columbia","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X17306314","volume":"20"},

Using energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy the obsidian is shown to be Melian, primarily from Sta Nychia, in keeping with Aegean Mesolithic procurement habits more generally.

  {"id":"casana2014","abstract":"With the ever expanding quantity of high-resolution aerial and satellite imagery available to archaeologists, numerous researchers have sought to address this “big data” challenge by developing automated methods to aid in the discovery and mapping of archaeological sites and features. This paper reviews several notable efforts to create automated discovery tools, including both spectral and object-based approaches, and highlights the difficulties these projects have encountered. Arguing instead for the critically important role of a human analyst in archaeological discovery, I illustrate interim results of an ongoing project that utilizes CORONA satellite imagery to document previously unknown sites in a 300,000 km2 study area in the northern Fertile Crescent. The project is based on what I term “brute force” methods, relying on systematic exploration of imagery by trained analysts, and has now successfully created a database of more than 14,000 sites, some 10,000 of which are previously undocumented. Results of the project highlight the need for human intervention to make any archaeological discovery meaningful, suggesting that imagery analysis, like any act of archaeological investigation, requires an engaged, thoughtful and creative scholar.\n, \nDesde la última década, la cantidad de imágenes aéreas y satelitales de alta resolución disponible a los arqueólogos ha crecido exponencialmente, y estos recursos ofrecen posibilidades enormes para el descubrimiento de elementos y sitios arqueológicos. La gran cantidad de datos aéreos y de satélite ya disponible a los arqueólogos puede ser abrumador, y esto ha causado que unos de nosotros busquemos herramientas automatizadas para poder manejar nuestra propia versión de “datos grandes.” Yo argumento que el análisis de imágenes aéreas y satelitales para encontrar evidencia de actividades culturales pasadas es tanto un arte hábil como ciencia. Es un proceso que requiere un arqueólogo empeñado, con un entendimiento de la historia del asentamiento local y las practicas de uso de terreno locales, y que pueda explorar imágenes creativamente para encontrar e interpretar elementos de posible importancia. Este es un trabajo que no puede ser automatizado, ni debería de ser, como sería la construcción de robots autónomos de excavación que hicieran nuestras propias excavaciones para nosotros. Ilustro este punto con un estudio de caso, utilizando imágenes satelitales CORONA en un esfuerzo para documentar sitios previamente no conocidos en un área de estudio de 300,000 km cuadrados en el norte de la Creciente Fértil.

  {"id":"casana2020","abstract":"Declassified CORONA satellite imagery, collected from 1960–1972 as part of the world’s first intelligence satellite program, provides nearly global, high-resolution, stereo imagery that predates many of the land-use changes seen in recent decades, and thus has proven to be an immensely valuable resource for archaeological research. While challenges involved in spatially correcting these unusual panoramic film images has long served as a stumbling block to researchers, an online tool called “Sunspot” now offers a straightforward process for efficient and accurate orthorectification of CORONA, helping to unlock the potential of this historical imagery for global-scale archaeological prospection. With these new opportunities come significant new challenges in how best to search through large imagery datasets like that offered by CORONA. In contrast to currently popular trends in archaeological remote sensing that seek to employ either automated, machine learning-based approaches, or alternatively, crowd-sourced approaches to assist in the identification of ancient sites and features, this paper argues for systematic, intensive, and expert-led “brute force” methods. Results from a project that has sought to map all sites and related features across a large study in the northern Fertile Crescent illustrate how an expert-led analysis may be the best means of generating nuanced, contextual understandings of complex archaeological landscapes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Casana","given":"Jesse"}],"citation-key":"casana2020","container-title":"Journal of Field Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00934690.2020.1713285","ISSN":"0093-4690","issue":"sup1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,20]]},"page":"S89-S100","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Global-Scale Archaeological Prospection using CORONA Satellite Imagery: Automated, Crowd-Sourced, and Expert-led Approaches","title-short":"Global-Scale Archaeological Prospection using CORONA Satellite Imagery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00934690.2020.1713285","volume":"45"},

  {"id":"castaneda2009","abstract":"This article presents a methodology of ethnographic fieldwork that can be used in the ethnographic study of archaeology. The methodology is called ethnographic installation and was developed in the context of research on the social contexts of archaeology in Yucatán, México. The core idea is to develop an exhibition of materials relevant to a community, and design this installation as a site of ethnographic fieldwork. This article discusses the theoretical and ontological underpinnings of this methodology, such as performativity, staging, expanded documentation, transcultural dynamics, ethnographic triggers, and evocation. Ethnographic installation is explained through the example of a research project conducted in a Maya community located near Chichén Itzá. The project used archival materials pertaining to the history of archaeological research sponsored by the Carnegie Institution of Washington between 1923 and 1941. These materials were presented to the community as a way to facilitate community reappropriation of a shared history with archaeology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Castañeda","given":"Quetzil E."}],"citation-key":"castaneda2009","container-title":"Public Archaeology","DOI":"10.1179/175355309X457277","ISSN":"1465-5187","issue":"2-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",8,1]]},"page":"262-282","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The 'Past' as Transcultural Space: Using Ethnographic Installation in the Study of Archaeology","title-short":"The 'Past' as Transcultural Space","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1179/175355309X457277","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"castelle2013","abstract":"To what can we ascribe the commercial dominance and organizational ubiquity of relational databases in the 1990s and early 2000s? By integrating perspectives from classical sociological theory, the history of administrative computing, and linguistic anthropology with papers and proceedings from the nascent database research community, this paper argues that the success of relational databases (and their corresponding tabular data models) can be ascribed to three distinctive components: 1) a semiotic distinctiveness from previously-existing (and now largely forgotten) hierarchical and network models; 2) a bureaucratic correspondence with practices of file organization and index-based retrieval; and 3) support for transaction processing, which facilitated adoption by a wide variety of organizations in commerce, banking, and finance. These three aspects are in turn used to suggest ways for understanding the potential significance (or lack thereof) of an emerging 21st-century market for non-relational and/or “Big Data” database systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Castelle","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"castelle2013","container-title":"Computational Culture","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",11,16]]},"language":"en, sv","title":"Relational and Non-Relational Models in the Entextualization of Bureaucracy : Computational Culture","title-short":"Relational and Non-Relational Models in the Entextualization of Bureaucracy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://computationalculture.net/relational-and-non-relational-models-in-the-entextualization-of-bureaucracy/"},

It includes methods and examples to deal with the issue of uncertainty and vagueness arising from archaeological datasets and elaborates quantitative tools to process and integrate it in a Machine Learning (ML) framework. In particular, the chapter is focused on the combination of a fuzzy set approach with the well-known ensemble algorithm of Random Forest (RF). On this basis, Archaeological Predictive Maps (APM) for two case studies are produced and an uncertainty visualization strategy is defined, based on statistics and cognitive theory methods. A procedure is suggested in order to visually represent and communicate the uncertainty in the final output of the modeling procedure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Castiello","given":"Maria Elena"}],"citation-key":"castiello2023","collection-title":"Quantitative Archaeology and Archaeological Modelling","container-title":"Discourse and Argumentation in Archaeology: Conceptual and Computational Approaches","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-031-37156-1_13","editor":[{"family":"Gonzalez-Perez","given":"Cesar"},{"family":"Martin-Rodilla","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Pereira-Fariña","given":"Martín"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-031-37156-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"291-315","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"Computational Processing of Language Vagueness for Archaeological Site Modelling","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-37156-1_13"},
  {"id":"castillo2019","abstract":"The addition of drones to the archaeologist's toolbox has brought about exciting new possibilities, particularly for field research and the conservation and protection of our built heritage. As drones become more widely available and effective, the challenge of precision becomes more important. Better georeferencing and higher-resolution outputs are the current thresholds. In order to achieve the second objective with our current equipment, drones have to fly closer to the ground and, ideally, follow the elevation of the surface. This task can be extremely complicated along the steep surfaces and mountains typical to the Andean region where we work. In this article, we present a recording (flying and photographing) methodology that achieves a higher ground resolution by dividing up the sites into several altitudinal sections, which are flown independently yet processed photogrammetrically as a single set. We have named this methodology “Flying Slopes in Multiple Stepped Polygons.”, La inclusión de drones en el equipamiento científico ha traído nuevas posibilidades para casi todos los campos de investigación. Esto ha sido particularmente cierto para los estudios arqueológicos de campo y para la conservación y protección del patrimonio construido. A medida que los drones se hacen más accesibles y efectivos, el reto de la precisión se hace más importante. Mejor georreferenciación y productos de mayor resolución son el reto actual. Para obtener el segundo objetivo con el equipo disponible, los drones tienen que volar más cerca de la superficie, e idealmente, deben seguir las elevaciones del terreno. Esta tarea puede ser extremadamente difícil en terrenos con pendientes y en montañas, típicas de la región andina donde trabajamos. En este artículo presentamos una metodología de registro (para volar y fotografiar) que consigue una mayor resolución del terreno dividiendo los sitios en varis secciones altitudinales, que se vuelan independientemente, pero que se procesan en programas de fotogrametría como un solo conjunto.

  {"id":"caux2018","abstract":"Chert alteration in Paleolithic contexts, generally known as “patina” by prehistorians, has long been recognized. Originally, different types of “patina” were defined as “white patina”, “glossy patina”, or “porcelain-like patina”, all of which involved changes in the color and/or roughness of the initial raw material. Alteration degrees are used in many research fields like taphonomy, petroarchaeology or use-wear analysis; however most of these studies are still based on qualitative descriptions using a wide range of terms that bring about confusion. In this paper, we present first the results of an inter-observer's blind-test where color and roughness are described at macroscopic scale. Secondly, we use quantitative methods to compare archaeological and experimental altered silicifications: light spectrometry and confocal microscopy are used to quantify color and roughness. We show here how macroscopic qualitative descriptions could lead to confusion because of the lack of calibration and the number of terms used differently by each one. We demonstrated the efficiency of quantitative methods as light spectrometry and confocal microscopy that will significantly enhance studies of surface alteration in terms of taphonomy, use-wear analyses, and petroarchaeology issues as well as interdisciplinary discussions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Caux","given":"Solene"},{"family":"Galland","given":"Aline"},{"family":"Queffelec","given":"Alain"},{"family":"Bordes","given":"Jean-Guillaume"}],"citation-key":"caux2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2018.04.027","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,1]]},"page":"210-219","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Aspects and characterization of chert alteration in an archaeological context: A qualitative to quantitative pilot study","title-short":"Aspects and characterization of chert alteration in an archaeological context","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18300841","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"cetina2000","abstract":"This paper rests on the assumption of an increased presence and relevance of object worlds in the social world. It holds that this influx of object worlds coincides with changing patterns of human relatedness that can be glossed by the notion postsocial forms. Postsocial forms include object-relationships where the objects are non-human entities. One characteristic of the present situation is that perhaps for the first time in recent history it appears unclear whether other persons are, for human beings, the most fascinating part of their environment. Objects may also be the risk winners of the relationship risks which many authors find inherent in contemporary human relations. Postsocial forms \"step into the place\" of social relations where these empty out, where they lose some of the meaningfulness they have had in earlier periods. A condition for understanding this role of objects is that we develop, in social theory, adequate concepts of objects that break with the tradition of seeing them merely as abstract technologies that promote alienation or as fetishized commodities that freeze and numb any human or political potential (Marx). In this paper, we use a different conception developed in an earlier paper. We also explore in some detail a notion of postsocial relatedness that is based on the idea of a dynamic of wantings and lacks of fulfilment. The paper explores this framework in the area of financial markets, where traders relate to the market as an object of attachment within an environment of reiterated lacks. /// Les auteurs constatent la présence et l'importance grandissantes de mondes d'objets au sein de l'univers social -- afflux qui refléterait une transformation des rapports humains, exprimée par la notion de \"formes postsociales\". Ces formes incluent des relations objectales au sein desquelles l'objet désigne une entité matérielle (c.-à-d. non humaine). Pour la première fois, dans l'histoire récente tout du moins, les autres êtres humains ne sont peut-être plus les éléments les plus fascinants de notre univers. Les objets seraient le pari gagnant d'un modèle de factorisation des risques inhérents aux relations humaines que relèvent de nombreux chercheurs. Les formes dites postsociales s'instaurent quand les relations sociales se vident du sens qu'elles avaient jusqu'alors. Pour mieux comprendre ce phénomène, il est impératif de repenser les concepts traditionnels, qui voient les objets comme des technologies abstraites aliénantes ou des commodités fétichisées, obnubilant tout potentiel humain ou politique (Marx). Nous développons ici un concept différent, ébauché dans une étude antérieure. Nous explorons également la notion de rapports postsociaux d'après une dynamique de désirs et de besoins inassouvis -- notamment dans l'univers boursier, où les agents entretiennent avec le marché des relations objectales fondées sur des manques réitérés.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Cetina","given":"Karin Knorr"},{"family":"Bruegger","given":"Urs"}],"citation-key":"cetina2000","container-title":"The Canadian Journal of Sociology / Cahiers canadiens de sociologie","DOI":"10.2307/3341821","ISSN":"0318-6431","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"page":"141-168","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Market as an Object of Attachment: Exploring Postsocial Relations in Financial Markets","title-short":"The Market as an Object of Attachment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3341821","volume":"25"},

The discursive nature of Wheeler’s representations was deeply embedded in the disciplinarian ideologies of the colonial project, the scientific project and the military project. This article analyzes Wheeler’s methodical attempt at conflating the three projects by disciplining archaeology as a scientific practice in a colonial space. I argue that this was articulated by appropriating the ideas of ‘epistemic marker’ and ‘ethnic marker’ as visual tropes to transform the visual representations produced in a colonial context into a scientific discourse, aimed at transforming the discipline.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Chadha","given":"Ashish"}],"citation-key":"chadha2002","container-title":"Journal of Social Archaeology","DOI":"10.1177/146960530200200305","ISSN":"1469-6053","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"378-401","publisher":"SAGE Publications","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Visions of discipline: Sir Mortimer Wheeler and the archaeological method in India (1944-1948)","title-short":"Visions of discipline","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/146960530200200305","volume":"2"},

Proposed reﬂexive methodologies still perpetuate many traditional hierarchies of power, and fail to consider the creative nature of excavation and post-excavation. Much archaeological work in Britain, Europe and North America also takes place within the commercial sphere, and post-processual ideas cannot advance archaeological practice unless they can be implemented in contract archaeology. This paper examines theoretical considerations of reﬂexivity, representation, subjectivity and sensual engagement to highlight their relevance to everyday archaeological practice, and their political potential to undermine existing hierarchies of power within commercial archaeology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Chadwick","given":"Adrian"}],"citation-key":"chadwick2003","container-title":"Archaeological Dialogues","container-title-short":"Arch.

  {"id":"chapman2014","abstract":"How do archaeologists make effective use of physical traces and material culture as repositories of evidence? Material Evidence takes a resolutely case-based approach to this question, exploring instances of exemplary practice, key challenges, instructive failures, and innovative developments in the use of archaeological data as evidence. The goal is to bring to the surface the wisdom of practice, teasing out norms of archaeological reasoning from evidence.   Archaeologists make compelling use of an enormously diverse range of material evidence, from garbage dumps to monuments, from finely crafted artifacts rich with cultural significance to the detritus of everyday life and the inadvertent transformation of landscapes over the long term. Each contributor to Material Evidence identifies a particular type of evidence with which they grapple and considers, with reference to concrete examples, how archaeologists construct evidential claims, critically assess them, and bring them to bear on pivotal questions about the cultural past.   Historians, cultural anthropologists, philosophers, and science studies scholars are increasingly interested in working with material things as objects of inquiry and as evidence – and they acknowledge on all sides just how challenging this is. One of the central messages of the book is that close analysis of archaeological best practice can yield constructive guidelines for practice that have much to offer archaeologists and those in related fields.","author":[{"family":"Chapman","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Wylie","given":"Alison"}],"citation-key":"chapman2014","event-place":"London and New York","ISBN":"978-1-317-57623-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",12,5]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"383","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"London and New York","source":"Google Books","title":"Material Evidence: Learning from Archaeological Practice","title-short":"Material Evidence","type":"book"},

  {"id":"chapman2016","abstract":"How do archaeologists work with the data they identify as a record of the cultural past? How are these data collected and construed as evidence? What is the impact on archaeological practice of new techniques of data recovery and analysis, especially those imported from the sciences? To answer these questions, the authors identify close-to-the-ground principles of best practice based on an analysis of examples of evidential reasoning in archaeology that are widely regarded as successful, contested, or instructive failures. They look at how archaeologists put old evidence to work in pursuit of new interpretations, how they construct provisional foundations for inquiry as they go, and how they navigate the multidisciplinary ties that make archaeology a productive intellectual trading zone. This case-based approach is predicated on a conviction that archaeological practice is a repository of considerable methodological wisdom, embodied in tacit norms and skilled expertise – wisdom that is rarely made explicit except when contested, and is often obscured when questions about the status and reach of archaeological evidence figure in high-profile crisis debates.","author":[{"family":"Chapman","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Wylie","given":"Alison"}],"citation-key":"chapman2016","ISBN":"978-1-4725-2527-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"english","number-of-pages":"265","publisher":"Bloomsbury Academic","title":"Evidential Reasoning in Archaeology","type":"book"},

  {"id":"chassanoff2016","abstract":"Widespread digitization has presented scholars with unprecedented access to archival sources. In particular, the availability of archival photographs through online collections has been championed as an opportunity to fill in underrepresented histories absent from archival collections. Yet the degree to which scholars are using digital visual sources, and how they are using them, is relatively unexplored in the literature. In part, this can be attributed to the difficulties of modeling visual information use; no empirical models currently link scholarly interpretive practices to how scholars actually use visual materials. This dissertation sought to address these gaps in the literature by examining the experiences of one group – self-identified historians using digitized archival photographs as evidence in their scholarly activities. This study uses an embedded case study approach to explore how and why historians use images in the construction of their arguments. Fifteen participants were recruited during the spring and summer of 2015. I conducted semi-structured interviews with each participant, eliciting descriptions about their image practices and specific experiences related to image use. I used thematic analysis and thematic synthesis to reveal salient aspects of historians’ experiences as they interpret and decide to use (or not use) materials. To strengthen and verify the analysis, I used triangulation strategies at different stages in the study. The results of this exploratory research can be used to inform designs for archival description and access, and to provide guidance for historical image use. In particular, my findings disclose the various factors that matter to historians in their experiences interacting with archival photographs in digital environments. Examples of image use are largely absent from the historical literature; the case studies presented in this research help to illustrate the functional ways historians currently use digitized photographs in both research and instructional capacities. Each case also sheds light on the processes and practices historians employ as they construct evidence from photographs and supplementary materials. This research also makes important theoretical contributions to the LIS literature. While there has been unquestionable growth in access to digital sources, few empirical studies have examined scholarly interactions with digitized archival materials. Toward that end, this study introduces a conceptual framework for exploring how and why historians use digitized photographs. It presents a holistic methodology that focuses attention on information experiences as spaces for meaning-making in digital environments. Attending to my participants' experiences using photographs as historical evidence helped to reveal, in the words of Gregory Bateson, “the difference that makes a difference.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Chassanoff","given":"Alexandra"}],"citation-key":"chassanoff2016","DOI":"10.17615/EQQK-YY06","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","license":"In Copyright","publisher":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill University Libraries","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Historians' Experiences Using Digitized Archival Photographs as Evidence","type":"thesis","URL":"https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/concern/dissertations/xw42n8345?locale=en"},

The article will then approach the function of code at the level of the category, arguing that an analysis of coded computer algorithms enables a supplement to Foucauldian thinking around biopolitics and biopower, of what I call soft biopower and soft biopolitics. These new conceptual devices allow us to better understand the workings of biopower at the level of the category, of using computer code, statistics and surveillance to construct categories within populations according to users’ surveilled internet history.

Repeated oxygen isotope ratio measurements were significantly different, even following correction for acid-carbonate fractionation at different temperatures and the renormalization of 2017 δ values using one point; however, differences were not meaningful for interpretations.

And, the authors point out, it is too rarely discussed at all. But the current crisis in repository space has increased awareness that the long-term conservation and preservation of the material remains and field notes of an archaeological project are as important as the finds themselves. Sullivan and Childs, two experienced archaeologists and museum professionals, provide an introductory guide to curation for archaeologists. Crucial to this process is the recognition of curation issues before the first day of fieldwork and continuous involvement of curators in the process throughout the archaeological project. The authors provide guidance on how to manage a collection, what to do with field notes and other project documents, how to find a repository for the collection, and how to adjust field practices so that the process runs smoothly. This brief, practical guide will be invaluable to all field archaeologists and their students, and to museum professionals who curate archaeological collections.","author":[{"family":"Childs","given":"Terry S."},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Lynne P."}],"citation-key":"childs2003","ISBN":"978-0-7591-1630-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",3,12]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"172","publisher":"Rowman Altamira","source":"Google Books","title":"Curating Archaeological Collections: From the Field to the Repository","title-short":"Curating Archaeological Collections","type":"book"},
  {"id":"childs2017","abstract":"The discipline of archaeology has been tolerating, at best, a “curation crisis” for decades that is unsustainable. The many issues related to long-term collections care continue to worsen. To counter this trend, we advocate that planning for collections be integrated into project administration from inception such that the management of archaeological collections begins before fieldwork and continues well after recovered collections reach the repository. To conceptualize this process, we identify the Collection Management Cycle as a framework for the many stakeholders involved in archaeological projects. We also provide a checklist that identifies the responsibilities stakeholders have to the collections they generate, fund, care for, manage, and/or study. Concerted use of the checklist and other proposed solutions will lead to a new era of a more sustainable archaeological practice., Durante décadas, la disciplina de la arqueología ha tolerado, en el mejor de los casos, una “crisis de curación” que es insostenible.

Para contrarrestar esta tendencia, proponemos que la planificación de las colecciones sea integrada en la administración del proyecto desde el comienzo, de tal forma que el manejo de las colecciones arqueológicas comience antes del trabajo de campo y continúe después de que las colecciones recuperadas lleguen al depósito. Para conceptualizar este proceso, identificamos el ciclo de administración de la colección como un marco para los muchos depositarios involucrados en los proyectos arqueológicos. Además, proveemos una lista de verificación que identifica las responsabilidades de los depositarios respecto a las colecciones que generan, financian, cuidan, gestionan y estudian. El uso conjunto de la lista de verificación y otras soluciones propuestas conducirá a una nueva era de prácticas arqueológicas más sostenibles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Childs","given":"S.

  {"id":"chirikure2017","abstract":"The world renowned site of Great Zimbabwe is one of the most globally significant archaeological sites in Africa. Ironically, this importance is not matched by the little amount of information that is known about such an iconic site. The heritage of this regrettable situation was birthed by the destructive activities of late nineteenth and early twentieth century antiquarians who vandalised tons of evidence without record. Throughout the twentieth century, however, professional archaeologists made interventions that rescued information from various parts of the site but most of which was never published. A moratorium imposed on archaeological excavations at the site in the early 1990s failed to stimulate an active engagement with material that was archived since the first professional excavations began. Motivated by the need to understand the site in new ways, research was initiated to revisit the site’s patchy and scattered archives and to supplement them with field surveys. This paper discusses the re-mapping of the site which, for the first time, comprehensively produced themed layers of spatial, chronological and material culture distribution. The main outcome is that most existing maps ignored a large number of terraces on the hill and omitted evidence of occupation in key areas. When combined with excavation profiles that expose the massive rebuilding of the site by original residents, it becomes clear that settlement ebbed and flowed during the more than six centuries of occupation at the site.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Chirikure","given":"Shadreck"},{"family":"Bandama","given":"Foreman"},{"family":"Chipunza","given":"Kundishora"},{"family":"Mahachi","given":"Godfrey"},{"family":"Matenga","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Mupira","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Ndoro","given":"Webber"}],"citation-key":"chirikure2017","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-016-9275-1","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"489-513","source":"link-springer-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca","title":"Seen but Not Told: Re-mapping Great Zimbabwe Using Archival Data, Satellite Imagery and Geographical Information Systems","title-short":"Seen but Not Told","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-016-9275-1","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"choo2014","abstract":"This study examines early warning from the users' perspective as a special category of information seeking. Specifically, we look at the 2009 Victorian bushfires in Australia as an instructive case of early warning information seeking. The bushfires, the worst in Australia's recorded history, were unique in its ferocity and damage caused, but also in the amount of data and research that was generated. We analyzed the affected residents' information needs, seeking and use in terms of their cognitive, affective, and situational dimensions. We found that residents wanted information that would act as a “trigger for action,” provide timely warning, and indicate clearly fire severity. Nearly two thirds of residents surveyed did not receive an official warning. Almost half first found out that the bushfire was in their area through personal observation of smoke, embers, or flames. We suggest that a form of normalcy bias may have been at work during information seeking, causing people to interpret their situations as “normal” even when disaster warnings have been issued. Although the authorities had adopted a “Stay or Go” policy to help residents use warning information to decide between staying to defend their property or leaving early, the policy's effectiveness was undermined by information challenges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Choo","given":"Chun Wei"},{"family":"Nadarajah","given":"Indrani"}],"citation-key":"choo2014","container-title":"Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology","container-title-short":"J Assn Inf Sci Tec","DOI":"10.1002/asi.22952","ISSN":"2330-1643","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"84-97","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Early warning information seeking in the 2009 Victorian Bushfires","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.22952/abstract","volume":"65"},

This mentality marginalises and separates it from the rest of archaeological practices.

Archaeological fieldwork is one of the research environments being studied by the project, and one of our primary concerns was to observe and record current research practices in the wild and to examine the influence of new technologies on those practices. This research brings together well-established and advanced observation techniques used in social sciences and computing fields such as human–computer interaction with archaeological research and presents the deployment of an off-the-shelf wearable camcorder as a recording interface in archaeological fieldwork.

Yet a significant number of artefacts from archaeological sites in Georgia and Armenia produced chemical compositions that are unrelated to any Turkish or Caucasian source analyzed so far. Their origins may lie in these poorly known deposits. The objective of the collaborative project held by the University of Erzurum and the French mission \"Caucasus\" is to study the sources of obsidian in the Erzurum and Kars regions, in order to shed light on the intensity of exploitation of this material and to highlight the exchange networks that may have existed between north-eastern Turkey and the southern Caucasus. The analyses that we have carried out on the samples taken during this exploratory survey have enabled a definite extension of the territory of circulation of this obsidian to western Transcaucasia. The lack of knowledge concerning the diffusion of obsidian from the regions of Erzurum and Kars appears thus for the moment mainly related to insufficient geochemical characterisation of the sources, confirming the importance of future surveys.","author":[{"family":"Cil","given":"V."},{"family":"IŞıKLı","given":"M."},{"family":"Chataigner","given":"C."},{"family":"Gratuze","given":"B."}],"citation-key":"cil2017a","event-title":"WORLD SCIENCE: PROBLEMS AND INNOVATIONS","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"английский","page":"18-26","source":"eLibrary.ru","title":"Obsidian Sources in the Regions of Erzurum and Kars (NE Turkey): New Data in Chemical Analyses","title-short":"Obsidian Sources in the Regions of Erzurum and Kars (NE Turkey)","type":"paper-conference"},

In this paper, we have investigated adherence and disclosure of deviations for all articles published with the Preregistered badge in Psychological Science between February 2015 and November 2017 and shared our findings with the corresponding authors for feedback. Two out of 27 preregistered studies contained no deviations from the preregistration plan. In one study, all deviations were disclosed. Nine studies disclosed none of the deviations. We mainly observed (un)disclosed deviations from the plan regarding the reported sample size, exclusion criteria and statistical analysis.

  {"id":"clarke2015","abstract":"The long-term care of collected and created data is an ethical obligation in the fields of archaeology and cultural heritage management. With the growing application of digital methodologies in these fields and the complexity of the resulting data, this task has become complicated. Digital data preservation firms have emerged since this methodological shift, but their policies—championing the democratization of academic data—may conflict with the legal obligations dictated by the countries where data originate. Scholars thus face an inevitable choice between two obligations, one ethical and one legal. While the amount of digital data grows and the options for preservation remain fundamentally misaligned with research norms and project workflows, the digital dilemma places the integrity of data at risk of loss. This article addresses this dilemma by evaluating the existing data publication, archiving, and preservation repositories and considering how, as solutions to the digital dilemma, they can be integrated into multiple workflows. I also propose new directions for archaeological associations, suggesting that they should establish a means of evaluation and approval for third-party preservation firms managing the future of academic research prior to their inevitable ubiquity.\n, \nEl cuidado a largo plazo de los datos recogidos y creados es una obligación ética en el campo de la arqueología y la gestión del patrimonio cultural.

  {"id":"clindaniel2024","abstract":"Large sources of digital trace data (i.e. “Big Data”) have become increasingly important in the study of material culture. However, akin to the offline material culture traditionally studied by archaeologists, digital trace data is rarely a passive reflection of human behavior – it is a complex palimpsest produced through a variety of erasure and accretion formation processes. To better understand how digital trace palimpsests are formed and how digital formation processes influence and inform our ability to interpret the offline material processes they index, we introduce a computational method – high-frequency archaeological survey – which allows us to observe digital formation processes at a high temporal resolution, as well as a large spatial scale. Using this method every hour for one month, we surveyed posts from across the United States in Craigslist's “Free Stuff” category (popularly called “Curb Alert”), a user-generated source of big digital trace data, indexing material things that have been placed on users' curbs for removal by scavengers or trash collectors. For each post, we observed its time-to-erasure and any edits that were made during the study period – finding that the posts that survive represent a biased sample of those that were posted over the course of the month, conditioned by how recently and on what day the post is posted, the material characteristics of things that are posted about, as well as regional variation. Far from only being evidence of biased end-of-month data, however, we show that further analysis of identified digital formation processes can be an important object of study in its own right – in this case, shedding new light on social scientific questions linking the exchange of “free stuff” with the process of social stratification and urban inequality in the United States. Overall, our findings suggest the importance of accounting for and explicitly analyzing digital formation processes in studies that utilize digital trace data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Clindaniel","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Magnani","given":"Matthew"}],"citation-key":"clindaniel2024","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2023.105890","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,1]]},"page":"105890","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Digital formation processes: A high-frequency, large-scale investigation","title-short":"Digital formation processes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030544032300170X","volume":"161"},
  {"id":"cnuts2017","abstract":"The use of fire is essential for the preparation of hafting adhesives; both are suggested to be a proxy for distinguishing the technological expertise and complex cognition among Palaeolithic populations. While use of fire has been argued to exist from about 1.0 Ma onwards, evidence for adhesives in the Palaeolithic record is rare and fragmented. In spite of the close link between fire places and adhesives, no study has ever focussed on examining the impact of heat on adhesive deposition and preservation. This paper discusses the results of a combustion experiment that was undertaken to understand the impact of heat exposure on hafting adhesives. The results have significant implications for archaeological interpretations. Deposition in or near a fire proves to severely impact the types of residues that preserve on a stone tool. The vertically transferred heat is responsible for the loss of adhesives but also for the incidental production of adhesives and their deposition on stone tools. It can be hypothesised that the rare survival of adhesives on archaeological stone tools might not only be the result of direct contact with the fire but also the result of degradation due to heat from overlying fireplaces. If we are to improve our understanding of the preservation of adhesives, it is important to unstand the taphonomic processes that affect these adhesives, in particular heat alteration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Cnuts","given":"Dries"},{"family":"Tomasso","given":"Sonja"},{"family":"Rots","given":"Veerle"}],"citation-key":"cnuts2017","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-017-9361-z","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,8]]},"language":"en","page":"1-24","source":"link-springer-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca","title":"The Role of Fire in the Life of an Adhesive","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-017-9361-z"},

  {"id":"cobb2019","abstract":"The methodical recording and representation of spatial data are central to archaeological fieldwork and research. Until recently, centimeter-level precise geolocation equipment was the exclusive domain of researchers who could afford setups costing tens of thousands of dollars. However, high-quality measurements are being made more accessible by rapidly evolving technologies. These new tools, when used together with mobile technology for efficiently recording field data, open up the possibility of capturing the precise location of every find during an archaeological surface survey. An important step in reaching the desired outcome—centimeter-level recording for all—is experimentation with a variety of emerging low-cost setups. Accordingly, we tested the Reach and Reach RS, differential global navigation satellite systems (dGNSS) equipment produced by the company Emlid, during a surface survey in Armenia in June 2018. Our field application demonstrates that the use of dGNSS is already possible and that the described advances in precision enable improved recording and representation of spatial data., El registro y la representación sistemático de datos espaciales son fundamentales para el trabajo de campo y la investigación arqueológicos. Hasta hace poco, el equipo de geolocalización de precisión en centímetros era de dominio exclusivo para los investigadores que podían costearse herramientas de decenas de miles de dólares. Sin embargo, el área se está acercando rápidamente a un momento en que las mediciones de alta calidad se harán más accesibles mediante tecnologías de rápida evolución. Cuando se usan junto con la tecnología móvil para registrar datos de campo de manera eficiente, esto abre la posibilidad de capturar la ubicación precisa de cada hallazgo durante un examen de la superficie arqueológica. Un paso importante para alcanzar el resultado deseado—el registro a nivel de centímetros para todos—es la experimentación realizada por investigadores con una variedad de equipos emergentes de bajo costo. Por consiguiente, probamos el Reach y Reach RS, el equipo diferencial GNSS producido por la empresa Emlid, durante un reciente estudio de superficie en Armenia en junio de 2018, e informamos de nuestros resultados aquí. Concluimos que, incluso con algunos desafíos, nuestra aplicación de campo demuestra que el dGNSS asequible ya es posible, y que los avances descritos en la precisión permitirán un mejor registro y representación de los datos espaciales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Cobb","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Earley-Spadoni","given":"Tiffany"},{"family":"Dames","given":"Philip"}],"citation-key":"cobb2019","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2019.21","ISSN":"2326-3768","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"1-13","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Centimeter-Level Recording for All: Field Experimentation with New, Affordable Geolocation Technology","title-short":"Centimeter-Level Recording for All","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/centimeterlevel-recording-for-all-field-experimentation-with-new-affordable-geolocation-technology/97F832F2A23166AD197BDD9CA7524238"},

  {"id":"codding2015","abstract":"The future of archaeological science relies as much (if not more) on theoretical as on methodological developments. As with anything in biology, explaining past human behavior will require the application of evolutionary theory. As with anything in archaeology, theory is useless without clear ties to a material record. Human behavioral ecology (HBE) has become one of the central theoretical frameworks in archaeological science by providing a broad conceptual toolkit for linking principles of natural selection to operational hypotheses about variability in behavior and its material consequences. Here we review the general approach and outline cases where applying HBE models can contribute to key research issues in archaeology. These examples illustrate how foundational applications of HBE are being built upon to explain complex and diverse phenomena ranging from the origins of agriculture to the emergence of institutionalized inequality. With each case, we outline avenues where this research strategy can advance archaeological science into the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Codding","given":"Brian F."},{"family":"Bird","given":"Douglas W."}],"citation-key":"codding2015","collection-title":"Scoping the Future of Archaeological Science: Papers in Honour of Richard Klein","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2015.02.027","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",4,1]]},"page":"9-20","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Behavioral ecology and the future of archaeological science","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440315000655","volume":"56"},
  {"id":"coddington2015","abstract":"As quantitative forms have become more prevalent in professional journalism, it has become increasingly important to distinguish between them and examine their roles in contemporary journalistic practice. This study defines and compares three quantitative forms of journalism—computer-assisted reporting, data journalism, and computational journalism—examining the points of overlap and divergence among their journalistic values and practices. After setting the three forms against the cultural backdrop of the convergence between the open-source movement and professional journalistic norms, the study introduces a four-part typology to evaluate their epistemological and professional dimensions. In it, the three forms are classified according to their orientation toward professional expertise or networked participation, transparency or opacity, big data or targeted sampling, and a vision of an active or passive public. These three quantitative journalistic forms are ultimately characterized as related but distinct approaches to integrating the values of open-source culture and social science with those of professional journalism, each with its own flaws but also its own distinct contribution to democratically robust journalistic practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Coddington","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"coddington2015","container-title":"Digital Journalism","DOI":"10.1080/21670811.2014.976400","ISSN":"2167-0811","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",5,4]]},"page":"331-348","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Clarifying Journalism’s Quantitative Turn","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2014.976400","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"cofield2024","abstract":"Archaeologists are taught about the importance of professional recordation and our ethical obligations to those associated records and data. These teachings imply that practitioners are meeting a professional standard of recordation that will stand the test of time, but the ongoing digital revolution is changing the way records and data are created and preserved. Best practices for the management and use of digital archaeological records have been published, and devoted digital archives offer these services. However, the ability of traditional archaeological repositories to adopt best practices or pay for digital curation is poorly understood. This article presents the results of a survey asking how the flood of digital records and data has impacted the ability of archaeological repositories to collect, manage, preserve, use, and make accessible digital archaeological records and data. Are repositories adopting the best practices that have been outlined? What kinds of challenges do repositories face regarding digital records and data? Are they being overcome successfully? The survey results offer a snapshot of current practice and point to future directions that should be pursued to ensure that the discipline is meeting its professional obligations., Se les enseña a arqueólogos de la importancia de registración al nivel profesional y nuestras obligaciones éticas con respecto a estos registros y datos asociados.

  {"id":"cohen2022","abstract":"Data ownership and accessibility are critical issues across academia, but especially in fields that touch upon digital heritage that relates to pre-colonial/colonial societies. Who can access spatial datasets about pre-colonial landscapes, who is writing about these topics, and who, by extension, is considered an authority on these topics? This paper explores data ownership, gender, and local affiliation by examining publications on archaeological lidar in Latin America between 2011 and 2021. For over 10 years, archaeological remote sensing derived from lidar has transformed research in Latin America and especially in Mesoamerica, yet there are numerous issues related to data ownership and authoritative voice that remain unresolved. This study shows that publication authorship, including first and co-authorship, is dominated by male researchers at US institutions while women and individuals associated with institutions in Latin America are poorly represented. The limited representation of authors with local or community affiliations suggests that local authoritative voices are largely muted in archaeological lidar research in the region. We discuss working toward more collaborative lidar research in Latin America.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Cohen","given":"Anna S."},{"family":"Fernandez-Diaz","given":"Juan Carlos"},{"family":"Meeks","given":"Amanda"}],"citation-key":"cohen2022","container-title":"Archaeologies","container-title-short":"Arch","DOI":"10.1007/s11759-022-09464-z","ISSN":"1935-3987","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,19]]},"language":"en","source":"Springer Link","title":"Exploring the Nature of Authority Over, and Ownership of Data Generated by Archaeological Lidar Projects in Latin America","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11759-022-09464-z"},
  {"id":"cohn2009","abstract":"In software development, there is an interplay between Software Process models and Software Process enactments. The former tends to be abstract descriptions or plans. The latter tends to be specific instantiations of some ideal procedure. In this paper, we examine the role of work artifacts and conversations in negotiating between prescriptions from a model and the contingencies that arise in an enactment. A qualitative field study at two Agile software development companies was conducted to investigate the role of artifacts in the software development work and the relationship between these artifacts and the Software Process. Documentation of software requirements is a major concern among software developers and software researchers. Agile software development denotes a different relationship to documentation, one that warrants investigation. Empirical findings are presented which suggest a new understanding of the relationship between artifacts and Software Process. The paper argues that Software Process is a generative system, which participants called “The Conversation,” that emerges out of the interplay between Software Process models and Software Process enactments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Cohn","given":"Marisa Leavitt"},{"family":"Sim","given":"Susan Elliott"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Charlotte P."}],"citation-key":"cohn2009","container-title":"Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)","container-title-short":"Comput Supported Coop Work","DOI":"10.1007/s10606-009-9100-4","ISSN":"1573-7551","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",10,17]]},"language":"en","page":"401","source":"Springer Link","title":"What Counts as Software Process?

  {"id":"colaninno2015","abstract":"Body dimensions of animal remains provide evidence for subsistence technologies, seasonality of hunting and fishing, and generalized resource stress. Studies that rely on reconstructed body dimensions of fishes rarely address the possibility of differential preservation or recovery, which may result in inaccurate representations of size classes. We devise a method to test for differential fragmentation of archaeofauna1 specimens based on specimen size and location within the stratigraphic column. We also compare two methods for reconstructing animal size classes: one includes only complete specimens that can be measured accurately, and the other includes both fragmented and complete specimens. We use a collection of mullet (Mugil spp.) atlases from the McQueen Shell Ring, St. Catherines Island, Georgia (USA), many of which were included in a previous study of fish body size as evidence for fishing technologies. All atlases are sorted by size class and categorized as having complete or fragmented osteometric landmarks. There is a positive correlation (ρ = 0.45, P = 0.07) between atlas size class and proportion of specimens that are fragmented: smaller atlases are more likely to be recovered, identified, and measured without fragmentation compared to larger atlases. Size-based differential fragmentation may bias against the representation of larger-bodied individuals in this context. Frequency of fragmentation is not monotonically correlated with burial depth (ρ = −0.19, P = 0.39), and is higher in the upper-most and bottom-most levels of the stratigraphic column compared to intermediate depths. Depth-based differential fragmentation may bias results when stratigraphic sequences are used to evaluate change through time in animal body sizes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Colaninno","given":"Carol E."},{"family":"Hadden","given":"Carla S."},{"family":"Emmons","given":"Alexandra L."}],"citation-key":"colaninno2015","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2015.04.018","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,1]]},"page":"17-24","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Testing archaeofaunal collections for differential fragmentation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440315001582","volume":"61"},
  {"id":"colaninno2021","abstract":"Research indicates that sexual harassment and assault commonly occur during archaeological field research, and students, trainees, and early career professionals are more frequently subjected to harassing behaviors compared to mid-career and senior scientists. Specific to archaeological education, the undergraduate educational requirement of a field school puts students and trainees in situations where harassment historically has been unchecked. We present the results of a systematic content analysis of 24 sets of field school documents. We analyzed these documents with attention to how field school policies, procedures, and language may impact students’ perceptions of their expected behaviors, logistics and means of reporting, and stated policies surrounding sexual harassment and assault. Coding was conducted using an a priori coding scheme to identify practices that should lead to a safe and supportive field learning environment. Our coding scheme resulted in 11 primary codes that we summarized as three primary themes: (1) field school organization and expected student behavior, (2) logistics of the course, and (3) stated policies surrounding sexual harassment and assault. Based on these themes, we provide recommendations to modify field school documents and practices to create a field school that provides safe opportunities for students to learn.\n, \nLas investigaciones indican que el acoso y la agresión sexual, ocurren comúnmente durante la investigación de campo arqueológica y los estudiantes, aprendices y profesionales que están iniciando su carrera, están sujetos con mayor frecuencia a comportamientos de acoso en comparación con los científicos que van por la mitad de su carrea y los de alto nivel. Específicamente para la educación arqueológica, el requisito educativo de pregrado de una escuela de campo coloca a los estudiantes y aprendices en situaciones donde históricamente el acoso no ha sido controlado. Presentamos los resultados de un análisis de contenido sistemático del plan de estudio de 24 escuelas de campo. Revisamos estos documentos prestando atención a cómo las políticas, los procedimientos y el lenguaje de las escuelas de campo, pueden afectar las percepciones de los estudiantes sobre los comportamientos esperados, la logística, los medios de denuncia y las políticas declaradas en torno al acoso y la agresión sexual. La codificación de documentos se llevó a cabo utilizando un esquema de codificación deductiva, para identificar prácticas que deberían conducir a un entorno de aprendizaje de campo seguro y de apoyo. Nuestro esquema de codificación resultó en 11 códigos primarios que resumimos en tres temas principales: (1) organización de la escuela de campo y comportamiento esperado de los estudiantes, (2) logística del curso, y (3) políticas declaradas en torno al acoso y la agresión sexual. Basado en estos temas, proporcionamos varias recomendaciones para modificar los programas y las prácticas de las escuelas de campo, para asi crear una escuela de campo que brinde oportunidades seguras para que los estudiantes puedan aprender.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Colaninno","given":"Carol E."},{"family":"Beahm","given":"Emily L."},{"family":"Drexler","given":"Carl G."},{"family":"Lambert","given":"Shawn P."},{"family":"Sturdevant","given":"Clark H."}],"citation-key":"colaninno2021","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2021.32","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11]]},"language":"en","page":"366-378","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"The Field School Syllabus: Examining the Intersection of Best Practices and Practices that Support Student Safety and Inclusivity","title-short":"The Field School Syllabus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/abs/field-school-syllabus/3AFE56F619FEC1AF59C966E488BB03CB","volume":"9"},

And what does the emergence of a community dedicated to the production of free and open source software–and to hacking as a technical, aesthetic, and moral project–reveal about the values of contemporary liberalism? Exploring the rise and political significance of the free and open source software (F/OSS) movement in the United States and Europe, Coding Freedom details the ethics behind hackers' devotion to F/OSS, the social codes that guide its production, and the political struggles through which hackers question the scope and direction of copyright and patent law. In telling the story of the F/OSS movement, the book unfolds a broader narrative involving computing, the politics of access, and intellectual property. E. Gabriella Coleman tracks the ways in which hackers collaborate and examines passionate manifestos, hacker humor, free software project governance, and festive hacker conferences. Looking at the ways that hackers sustain their productive freedom, Coleman shows that these activists, driven by a commitment to their work, reformulate key ideals including free speech, transparency, and meritocracy, and refuse restrictive intellectual protections. Coleman demonstrates how hacking, so often marginalized or misunderstood, sheds light on the continuing relevance of liberalism in online collaboration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Coleman","given":"E.

  {"id":"collar2015","abstract":"The application of method and theory from network science to archaeology has dramatically increased over the last decade. In this article, we document this growth over time, discuss several of the important concepts that are used in the application of network approaches to archaeology, and introduce the other articles in this special issue on networks in archaeology. We argue that the suitability and contribution of network science techniques within particular archaeological research contexts can be usefully explored by scrutinizing the past phenomena under study, how these are abstracted into concepts, and how these in turn are represented as network data. For this reason, each of the articles in this special issue is discussed in terms of the phenomena that they seek to address, the abstraction in terms of concepts that they use to study connectivity, and the representations of network data that they employ in their analyses. The approaches currently being used are diverse and interdisciplinary, which we think are evidence of a healthy exploratory stage in the application of network science in archaeology. To facilitate further innovation, application, and collaboration, we also provide a glossary of terms that are currently being used in network science and especially those in the applications to archaeological case studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Collar","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Coward","given":"Fiona"},{"family":"Brughmans","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Mills","given":"Barbara J."}],"citation-key":"collar2015","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-014-9235-6","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-32","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Networks in Archaeology: Phenomena, Abstraction, Representation","title-short":"Networks in Archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-014-9235-6","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"collins2002","abstract":"Science studies has shown us why science and technology cannot always solve technical problems in the public domain. In particular, the speed of political decision-making is faster than the speed of scientific consensus formation. A predominant motif over recent years has been the need to extend the domain of technical decision-making beyond the technically qualified élite, so as to enhance political legitimacy. We argue, however, that the `Problem of Legitimacy' has been replaced by the `Problem of Extension' - that is, by a tendency to dissolve the boundary between experts and the public so that there are no longer any grounds for limiting the indefinite extension of technical decision-making rights. We argue that a Third Wave of Science Studies - Studies of Expertise and Experience (SEE) - is needed to solve the Problem of Extension. SEE will include a normative theory of expertise, and will disentangle expertise from political rights in technical decision-making. The theory builds categories of expertise, starting with the key distinction between interactive expertise and contributory expertise. A new categorization of types of science is also needed. We illustrate the potential of the approach by re-examining existing case studies, including Brian Wynne's study of Cumbrian sheep farmers. Sometimes the new theory argues for more public involvement, sometimes for less. An Appendix describes existing contributions to the problem of technical decision-making in the public domain.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Collins","given":"H.M."},{"family":"Evans","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"collins2002","container-title":"Social Studies of Science","container-title-short":"Soc Stud Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0306312702032002003","ISSN":"0306-3127","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"235-296","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Third Wave of Science Studies: Studies of Expertise and Experience","title-short":"The Third Wave of Science Studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0306312702032002003","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"coltofean-arizancu2021","abstract":"This book explores the history of interdisciplinary relationships between archaeology and other branches of knowledge in Europe and elsewhere. This is a largely untold history that needs to be unpacked. This book brings to light some of the events leading towards interdisciplinary relations in archaeology from the nineteenth to the twentieth century. It encompasses ten scholarly contributions that offer a critical overview of this complex, dynamic and long-lasting transformative process. This is a pioneering project in the field of the history of archaeology, as it is the first to examine the inclusion into archaeological practice of various disciplines categorized under the umbrella of hard, natural and social sciences, as well as the humanities.The authors of this volume include internationally acknowledged scholars of the history of archaeology, such as Margarita Díaz-Andreu, Nathan Schlanger and Oscar Moro, as well as other well-established authors in the field from Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Switzerland. The chapters cover a wide range of topics. Several of them deal with interdisciplinarity in archaeology on a more general level by analysing its relationship with other sciences in specific countries. Other chapters discuss the incorporation of disciplines such as palynology and zoology into archaeology, either on a wider scale or using certain countries as case studies. Some authors focus on the work of scholars as starting points for examining the intersection between antiquarianism, archaeology, the natural sciences and numismatics, while others theorize on the influence of epistemology and philosophy of science on archaeological theory and practice. Finally, the influence of the army is also discussed in the development of archaeology.","author":[{"family":"Coltofean-Arizancu","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Díaz-Andreu","given":"Margarita"}],"citation-key":"coltofean-arizancu2021","ISBN":"978-1-78925-467-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,15]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"367","publisher":"Oxbow Books","source":"Google Books","title":"Interdisciplinarity and Archaeology: Scientific Interactions in Nineteenth- and Twentieth-Century Archaeology","title-short":"Interdisciplinarity and Archaeology","type":"book"},

  {"id":"conger2019","abstract":"Only in the last decade have archaeologists working on Iroquoian sites in Ontario, Québec, and New York State begun to seize upon the potential of geophysical prospection and soil chemistry for identifying settlement features. Recent studies employing magnetic gradiometry, magnetic susceptibility, and soil phosphate analysis demonstrate that multi-method approaches have the potential to overcome the limitations imposed by intrusive historic features, soil composition, and underlying geology. We consider how specific aspects of the Iroquoian built environment, such as longhouses, palisades, and middens, might be visible in datasets produced by magnetic gradiometry, magnetic susceptibility, and soil phosphate analyses and apply these methods to two Iroquoian sites: Trent-Foster (BcGr-5), a late 16th-century Wendat village and Hamilton-Lougheed (BbHa-10), an early-to-mid 17th-century Tionontate village. At Trent-Foster, we interpret certain anomalies as potential longhouses, but suggest that a band of low magnetism cutting through the site may be due to underlying geology. At Hamilton-Lougheed, we identify a potential palisade and a likely habitation area. We conclude by acknowledging that the biggest imperative moving forward is the need for more ground-truthing to verify the presence or absence of built environment features suggested by geophysical and soil chemistry methods. We advocate for continued use and development of geophysical and geochemical methods on Iroquoian sites, particularly in the cultural resource management context, as they strike an important balance between preserving archaeological heritage and learning from that which is preserved, issues that are of the utmost importance to descendant communities and First Nations research partners.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Conger","given":"Megan Anne"},{"family":"Birch","given":"Jennifer"}],"citation-key":"conger2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.101888","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,1]]},"page":"101888","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Archaeological reconnaissance through multi-method geophysical and geochemical survey at two Iroquoian village sites, southern Ontario, Canada","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X19300380","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"contreras2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            The documentation and analysis of archaeological lithics must navigate a basic tension between examining and recording data on individual artifacts or on aggregates of artifacts. This poses a challenge both for artifact processing and for database construction. We present here an R Shiny solution that enables lithic analysts to enter data for both individual artifacts and aggregates of artifacts while maintaining a robust yet flexible data structure. This takes the form of a browser-based database interface that uses R to query existing data and transform new data as necessary so that users entering data of varying resolutions still produce data structured around individual artifacts. We demonstrate the function and efficacy of this tool (termed the Queryable Artifact Recording Interface [QuARI]) using the example of the Stelida Naxos Archaeological Project (SNAP), which, focused on a Paleolithic and Mesolithic chert quarry, has necessarily confronted challenges of processing and analyzing large quantities of lithic material.\n          , \n            \n              La documentación y análisis de materiales líticos tiene que navegar una tensión entre examinar y documentar artefactos individuales o sumas de artefactos.

  {"id":"cook2019","abstract":"Inclusive approaches to archaeology (including queer, feminist, black, indigenous, etc. perspectives) have increasingly intersected with coding, maker, and hacker cultures to develop a uniquely ‘Do-It-Yourself’ style of disruption and activism. Digital technology provides opportunities to challenge conventional representations of people past and present in creative ways, but at what cost? As a critical appraisal of transhumanism and the era of digital scholarship, this article outlines compelling applications in inclusive digital practice but also the pervasive structures of privilege, inequity, inaccessibility, and abuse that are facilitated by open, web-based heritage projects. In particular, it evaluates possible means of creating a balance between individual-focused translational storytelling and public profiles, and the personal and professional risks that accompany these approaches, with efforts to foster, support, and protect traditionally marginalized archaeologists and communities., Les démarches qui cherchent à promouvoir l'intégration en archéologie (y compris les perspectives allosexuelles, féministes, black ou indigènes) se recoupent de plus en plus avec celles des communautés associées au codage, à la réalisation et au piratage numérique dans le but de créer un style ‘bricolé’ de contestation et d'activisme. Les technologies numériques offrent des possibilités de remettre en question les représentations traditionnelles de personnes du passé et de nos jours de façon créative, mais à quel prix ? Dans cet article, une évaluation critique du transhumanisme et de l’ère numérique sert de point de départ à une présentation d'exemples numériques convaincants de pratique d'intégration mais aussi de l'omniprésence du privilège, de l'inégalité, du manque d'accès et des abus facilités par des projets d'accès libre sur internet concernant le patrimoine.

  {"id":"cooper2016","abstract":"This paper considers recent attempts within archaeology to create, integrate and interpret digital data on an unprecedented scale—a movement that resonates with the much wider so-called big data phenomenon. Using the example of our work with a particularly large and complex dataset collated for the purpose of the English Landscape and Identities project (EngLaID), Oxford, UK, and drawing on insights from social scientists’ studies of information infrastructures much more broadly, we make the following key points. Firstly, alongside scrutinising and homogenising digital records for research purposes, it is vital that we continue to appreciate the broader interpretative value of ‘characterful’ archaeological data (those that have histories and flaws of various kinds). Secondly, given the intricate and pliable nature of archaeological data and the substantial challenges faced by researchers seeking to create a cyber-infrastructure for archaeology, it is essential that we develop interim measures that allow us to explore the parameters and potentials of working with archaeological evidence on an unprecedented scale. We also consider some of the practical and ethical consequences of working in this vein.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Cooper","given":"Anwen"},{"family":"Green","given":"Chris"}],"citation-key":"cooper2016","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-015-9240-4","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,1]]},"language":"english","page":"271–304","title":"Embracing the Complexities of ‘Big Data’ in Archaeology: The Case of the English Landscape and Identities Project","title-short":"Embracing the Complexities of ‘Big Data’ in Archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-015-9240-4","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"corbey2001","abstract":"This history of human origin studies covers a wide range of disciplines. This important new study analyses a number of key episodes from palaeolithic archaeology, palaeoanthropology, primatology and evolutionary theory in terms of various ideas on how one should go about such reconstructions and what, if any, the uses of such historiographical exercises can be for current research in these disciplines. Their carefully argued point is that studying the history of palaeoanthropological thinking about the past can enhance the quality of current research on human origins.The main issues in the present volume are the uses of disciplinary history in terms of present-day research concerns, the relative weight of cultural and other 'external' contexts, and continuity and change in theoretical perspectives. The book's overall approach is an epistemological one. It does not, in other words, primarily address anthropological data as such, but our ways of handling such data in terms of our most fundamental, but usually quite implicit theoretical presuppositions.","author":[{"family":"Corbey","given":"Raymond"},{"family":"Roebroeks","given":"Wil"}],"citation-key":"corbey2001","ISBN":"978-90-5356-464-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"194","publisher":"Amsterdam University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Studying Human Origins: Disciplinary History and Epistemology","title-short":"Studying Human Origins","type":"book"},

First, to speed up the process of gathering data by automatizing the way in which it is recovered. Second, it adds higher accuracy and the possibility of re-measuring archeological items without further directly interacting with the piece. Based on a combination of R scripting with GIS features, Geomeasure is at the time able to automatically gather 125–130 typometric variables per archaeological item, with the only input of vectorized photographs. It can be used as a reliable methodological aid to extract detailed information on patterns and trends of shape variability. The system has currently been applied over a sample of 2,000+ geometric microliths in the Eastern Iberian Peninsula. The performance results of its application are on display, and the system is compared to other methodological approaches currently in use for capturing shape variability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Cortell-Nicolau","given":"Alfredo"}],"citation-key":"cortell-nicolau2019","container-title":"Lithic Technology","DOI":"10.1080/01977261.2019.1615805","ISSN":"0197-7261","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,15]]},"page":"1-13","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Geomeasure: GIS and Scripting for Measuring Morphometric Variability","title-short":"Geomeasure","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01977261.2019.1615805","volume":"0"},

The Participatory Web, as a space of active involvement, presence and socialisation of knowledge, has the potential to introduce significant changes to scholarly practice and to diversify it. This article draws on the findings of a narrative inquiry study that investigated the habitus of 10 digital scholars. The study uses Bourdieu's concepts of habitus, field, and social and cultural capital as a research lens. One of the main findings to come out of the study was that research participants’ approaches to digital scholarship practices are highly influenced by their online social capital, the online networks that influence their thinking and outlook on scholarly practices, including their advocacy of openness and transparency of academic practice. This article concludes by highlighting the dispositions digital scholars display in an attempt to characterise the values and beliefs that underpin their scholarly practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Costa","given":"Cristina"}],"citation-key":"costa2013","container-title":"Research in Learning Technology","DOI":"10.3402/rlt.v21.21274","ISSN":"2156-7069","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",4,29]]},"page":"21274","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The habitus of digital scholars","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/rlt.v21.21274","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"couldry2018","abstract":"As World Economic Forum?s definition of personal data as ?the new ?oil? ? a valuable resource of the 21st century? shows, large-scale data processing is increasingly considered the defining feature of contemporary economy and society. Commercial and governmental discourse on data frequently argues its benefits, and so legitimates its continuous and large-scale extraction and processing as the starting point for developments in specific industries, and potentially as the basis for societies as a whole. Against the background of the General Data Protection Regulation, this article unravels how general discourse on data covers over the social practices enabling collection of data, through the analysis of high-profile business reports and case studies of health and education sectors. We show how conceptualisation of data as having a natural basis in the everyday world protects data collection from ethical questioning while endorsing the use and free flow of data within corporate control, at the expense of its potentially negative impacts on personal autonomy and human freedom.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Couldry","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Jun"}],"citation-key":"couldry2018","container-title":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444818775968","ISSN":"1461-4448","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"4473-4491","publisher":"SAGE Publications","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Deconstructing datafication’s brave new world","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444818775968","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"crabtree2019","abstract":"A major challenge facing archaeologists is communicating our research to the\npublic. Thankfully, new computational tools have enabled the testing and\nvisualization of complex ideas in an easily packageable format. In this article\nwe illustrate not only how agent-based modeling provides a platform for\ncommunicating complex ideas, but also how these game-like computer models can be\nexplored and manipulated by members of the public therefore increasing their\nengagement in archaeological explanations. We suggest that these new digital\ntools serve as an excellent aid for education on the importance of\narchaeological sites and artifacts. To illustrate the above we walk the reader\nthrough a step-by-step pipeline of how to run an ABM model as an experiment and\nhow to export it into a form ready to be sent to SHPO and THPO offices in tandem\nwith reports. Ultimately, we hope that this work will help demystify the\ncomputational archaeology process and lead to more fluency in using agent-based\nmodeling in research and outreach., Uno de los mayores desafíos a los que se enfrentan los\narqueólogos es hacer llegar nuestra disciplina al público.\nAfortunadamente, las nuevas herramientas computacionales nos permiten examinar y\nvisualizar ideas complejas en un formato más accesible. En este\nartículo demostramos como los modelos basados en agentes pueden ser\nuna plataforma eficaz para la comunicación de ideas complejas,\nasí como accesibles al consumo público gracias a su\nsimilitud con los videojuegos. Aquí sugerimos que estas nuevas\nherramientas digitales pueden ser usadas de forma didáctica para\neducar en la importancia de los yacimientos y artefactos\narqueológicos. De esta manera, se pretende guiar al lector paso a\npaso para ejecutar un modelo como experimento que le permita exportar a las\noficinas del gobierno local (SHPO y THPO) en conjunto con los informes\narqueológicos. En última instancia, esperamos que este\ntrabajo pueda ayudar a desmitificar el método de la\narqueología computacional y permita su uso más frecuente\nen la investigación y divulgación\narqueológica.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Crabtree","given":"Stefani A."},{"family":"Harris","given":"Kathryn"},{"family":"Davies","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Romanowska","given":"Iza"}],"citation-key":"crabtree2019","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2019.4","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5]]},"language":"en","page":"194-202","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Outreach in Archaeology with Agent-Based Modeling: Part 3 of 3","title-short":"Outreach in Archaeology with Agent-Based Modeling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/outreach-in-archaeology-with-agentbased-modeling-part-3-of-3/CF17C24826753D58A882333AA565B7AE","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"cramb2022","abstract":"The goal for many PhD students in archaeology is tenure-track employment. Students primarily receive their training by tenure-track or tenured professors, and they are often tacitly expected—or explicitly encouraged—to follow in the footsteps of their advisor. However, the career trajectories that current and recent PhD students follow may hold little resemblance to the ones experienced by their advisors. To understand these different paths and to provide information for current PhD students considering pursuing a career in academia, we surveyed 438 archaeologists holding tenured or tenure-track positions in the United States. The survey, recorded in 2019, posed a variety of questions regarding the personal experiences of individual professors. The results are binned by the decade in which the respondent graduated. Evident patterns are discussed in terms of change over time. The resulting portraits of academic pathways through the past five decades indicate that although broad commonalities exist in the qualifications of early career academics, there is no singular pathway to obtaining tenure-track employment. We highlight the commonalities revealed in our survey to provide a set of general qualifications that might provide a baseline set of skills and experiences for an archaeologist seeking a tenure-track job in the United States.\n, \nDoctorantes en arqueología comúnmente anhelan lograr empleo académico con tenencia docente. Los estudiantes de doctorado principalmente reciben formación académica y profesional por parte de profesores que al igual han obtenido o anhelan obtener empleo con tenencia docente. Comúnmente, se espera tácita o explícitamente proseguir en pasos de sus asesores. Sin embargo, la trayectoria profesional de estudiantes doctorales y recién egresados suelen tener poca semejanza a las trayectorias de sus respectivos asesores. Encuestamos 438 arqueólogos en plazas con tenencia docente o con posibilidad de tenencia docente en los Estados Unidos para esclarecer diversas trayectorias profesionales y asesorar actuales doctorantes que contemplan una carrera académica. La encuesta que se llevó a cabo en 2019 plantea una variedad de preguntas acerca de experiencias individuales de los encuestados. Los resultados se agrupan por década en cual se egresó el encuestado. Se discuten los evidentes patrones conforme cambios cronológicos. Los resúmenes de trayectorias profesionales académicas a lo largo de las últimas cinco décadas indican que aunque existen características compartidas en las cualificaciones de los recién egresados académicos profesionales, no existe una ruta singular hacia un empleo con tenencia docente. Resaltamos las características compartidas entre los encuestados para presentar cualificaciones que pueden ser un punto de referencia de las destrezas y experiencias adecuadas para un arqueólogo en busca de tenencia docente en los Estados Unidos.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Cramb","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Ritchison","given":"Brandon T."},{"family":"Hadden","given":"Carla S."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qian"},{"family":"Alarcón-Tinajero","given":"Edgar"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xianyan"},{"family":"Jones","given":"K.

  {"id":"croix2019","abstract":"Recently, new augmented recording techniques have entered archaeological fieldwork. We review a major urban excavation in Ribe, Denmark, which has adopted a systematic use of 3D laser scanning and intensive soil and sediment micromorphological sampling as part of the excavation recording practice. Both methods represent a major advance in field documentation, achieving a higher degree of detail and precision for the recording of archaeological features. We argue that these technologies also challenge the current paradigm of single-context recording, i.e. the separation of layers and features as all-encompassing units of recording. First, 3D digital recording implies that contexts are defined in a more definite way than previously, with less flexibility for recursive revision. Second, micromorphology demonstrates how the strata separated in excavation are only a subset of those created in deposition. We call for a new approach, which takes into consideration the fact that excavation units do not always mirror depositional events, as assumed by single-context theory, and that different kinds of observations may not overlap, as assumed in single-context practice. Instead, interfaces, matrices and assemblages are restored as separate units to record and feed into the interpretation cycle. This may be described as recording metacontext: observations that go across or between contexts. We demonstrate how a systematic metacontext registration can lead to a manageable and more detailed excavation record, more faithful to the archaeologists’ observations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Croix","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Deckers","given":"Pieterjan"},{"family":"Feveile","given":"Claus"},{"family":"Knudsen","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Qvistgaard","given":"Sarah Skytte"},{"family":"Sindbæk","given":"Søren M."},{"family":"Wouters","given":"Barbora"}],"citation-key":"croix2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-019-09417-x","ISSN":"1573-7764","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,1]]},"language":"English","page":"1591–1631","title":"Single Context, Metacontext, and High Definition Archaeology: Integrating New Standards of Stratigraphic Excavation and Recording","title-short":"Single Context, Metacontext, and High Definition Archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-019-09417-x","volume":"26"},

The web enables new ways to measure scholarly productivity and impact, making available tools and data that can reveal patterns of intellectual activity and impact that were previously invisible: mentions, acknowledgments, endorsements, downloads, recommendations, blog posts, tweets. This book describes recent theoretical and practical advances in metrics-based research, examining a variety of alternative metrics—or “altmetrics”—while also considering the ethical and cultural consequences of relying on metrics to assess the quality of scholarship.\n            Once the domain of information scientists and mathematicians, bibliometrics is now a fast-growing, multidisciplinary field that ranges from webometrics to scientometrics to influmetrics.

  {"id":"croucher2020","abstract":"While death is universal, reactions to death and ways of dealing with the dead body are hugely diverse, and archaeological research reveals numerous ways of dealing with the dead through time and across the world. In this paper, findings are presented which not only demonstrate the power of archaeology to promote and aid discussion around this difficult and challenging topic, but also how our approach resulted in personal growth and professional development impacts for participants. In this interdisciplinary pilot study, archaeological case studies were used in 31 structured workshops with 187 participants from health and social care backgrounds in the UK, to explore their reactions to a diverse range of materials which documented wide and varied approaches to death and the dead. Our study supports the hypothesis that the past is a powerful instigator of conversation around challenging aspects of death, and after death care and practices: 93% of participants agreed with this. That exposure to archaeological case studies and artefacts stimulates multifaceted discourse, some of it difficult, is a theme that also emerges in our data from pre, post and follow-up questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews. The material prompted participants to reflect on their biases, expectations and norms around both treatment of the dead, and of bereavement, impacting on their values, attitudes and beliefs. Moreover, 87% of participants believed the workshop would have a personal effect through thinking differently about death and bereavement, and 57% thought it would impact on how they approached death and bereavement in their professional practice. This has huge implications today, where talk of death remains troublesome, and for some, has a near-taboo status–‘taboo’ being a theme evident in some participants’ own words. The findings have an important role to play in facilitating and normalising discussions around dying and bereavement and in equipping professionals in their work with people with advanced illness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Croucher","given":"Karina"},{"family":"Büster","given":"Lindsey"},{"family":"Dayes","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Green","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Raynsford","given":"Justine"},{"family":"Boyes","given":"Louise Comerford"},{"family":"Faull","given":"Christina"}],"citation-key":"croucher2020","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0244058","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,29]]},"language":"en","page":"e0244058","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Archaeology and contemporary death: Using the past to provoke, challenge and engage","title-short":"Archaeology and contemporary death","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0244058","volume":"15"},

The aim is to help archaeologists, researchers and those who manage the historic environment to decide first, whether using lidar data will actually be beneficial in terms of their research aims, and second, how the data can be used effectively. The guidance will be most useful to those who have access to data that have already been commissioned, or are planning to commission lidar for a specific purpose. They also provide an introduction to data interpretation in order to separate archaeological and non-archaeological features.  Although important themes are introduced, this guidance are not intended as a definitive explanation of the technique or the complexities of acquiring and processing the raw data, particularly as this is a still developing technology. This document is intended to complement 3D Laser Scanning for Heritage, which covers a wider range of uses of laser scanning for heritage purposes (Historic England 2018).  This Guidance is a revision of The Light Fantastic: Using Airborne Lidar in Archaeological Survey published by English Heritage in 2010. The text has largely been maintained except for certain areas where major changes have occurred in the ensuing years.

  {"id":"cueva-temprana2019","abstract":"Understanding the evolution of technological complexity is a major goal in the study of prehistoric lithic industries. This has led to the development of different methods to examine both archaeological items and their production processes. These methods have attempted to segment the actions that form an operational sequence, usually with the aim of quantifying the complexity involved in lithic knapping. However, to date, no study has been capable of cataloguing these actions to the point of characterizing the elements that comprise them. In this work, we propose an approach to identify the smallest unit of any knapping action: the manual gesture. Our goal is to provide a homogeneous language allowing the characterization and quantification of 1) the variability between lithic industries, and 2) the evolution of technological complexity, from both synchronic and diachronic view. As a proof-of-concept, we designed a pilot experiment to characterize the manual gestures involved in making choppers, chopping-tools and handaxes. Our results confirm the reliability of this approach. In addition, it points to the existence of a gestural primordial core that lasted throughout the Oldowan and the Acheulean –as knapping sequences increased in complexity- and the potential to identify some specific traits of the individual knappers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Cueva-Temprana","given":"Arturo"},{"family":"Lombao","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Morales","given":"Juan Ignacio"},{"family":"Geribàs","given":"Nuria"},{"family":"Mosquera","given":"Marina"}],"citation-key":"cueva-temprana2019","container-title":"Lithic Technology","DOI":"10.1080/01977261.2019.1587255","ISSN":"0197-7261","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,5]]},"page":"1-16","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Gestures During Knapping: A Two-perspective Approach to Pleistocene Technologies","title-short":"Gestures During Knapping","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01977261.2019.1587255","volume":"0"},

Here, I review three major platforms offering tutorials on digital archaeology: the Programming Historian, Project MERCURY-SIMREC, and the Open Digital Archaeology Textbook.

  {"id":"dallas2007","abstract":"Digital curation emerged as an important new concept in the theory and management of cultural information, not least because of its broad applicability and promise of a universal approach to ensure future \"fitness for purpose\" of digital information. This paper explores curatorial traditions in the field of museums and cultural heritage, in order to contribute to the active current debate on the nature, scope and methods of digital curation. It uses an approach inspired by cultural-historical activity theory in order, first, to understand current digital curation practice, its achievements and limitations; secondly, to explore key activities in the cultural heritage field, i.e., knowledge production in archaeological fieldwork and publication, museum curation, and meaning interaction in exhibition visitor experience. On account of these insights, it concludes that, in order to ensure the declared objective of future \"fitness for purpose\", and avoid the risk of epistemic failure, more effort should be dedicated by the digital curation community to developing adequate knowledge representation of digital information in specific epistemic and pragmatic contexts; that an agency-based approach, using event-centric approaches to represent knowledge on the content and context of information, would be particularly useful in some application domains; and that formal methods to curation lifecycle based on belief change and ontology evolution could also be used in modeling the co-evolution of the epistemic content and context of curated knowledge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Dallas","given":"Costis"}],"citation-key":"dallas2007","container-title":"ICHIM07 - International Cultural Heritage Informatics Meeting, Proceedings 2007, 1p","event-place":"Toronto","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"language":"eng","license":"info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","publisher":"Archives & Museum Informatics","publisher-place":"Toronto","source":"lekythos.library.ucy.ac.cy","title":"An agency-oriented approach to digital curation theory and practice","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://lekythos.library.ucy.ac.cy/handle/10797/13650"},

The overall discussion points include virtual exhibition in the context of virtual museums, the notion of virtualisation and some ideas on content, formal representations and affordances. At the same time, the author laments the fact that virtual exhibitions are still fledgling, unstable practices, ignored by the majority of the archaeological public and, at the same time, by most mainstream archaeologists and most archaeological museums. Further work requires unification with relevant research and practice in Information and Communication Technologies, but also further reflection and research on the production of archaeological meaning through virtualisation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Dallas","given":"Costis"}],"citation-key":"dallas2007a","editor":[{"family":"Moscati","given":"Paola"}],"event-place":"Firenze","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",1,1]]},"language":"english","page":"31–63","publisher":"All'Insegna del giglio","publisher-place":"Firenze","title":"Archaeological knowledge, virtual exhibitions and the social construction of meaning","type":"chapter","URL":"http://www.archcalc.cnr.it/indice/Suppl_1/4_Dallas.pdf"},
  {"id":"dallas2009","abstract":"Research in theoretical and computer-based archaeology, from the 1950s onwards, established important perspectives for the formal representation and analysis of tangible cultural entities such as complex artefacts, iconographic compositions and archaeological assemblages, and became a precursor for the emergence of knowledge-based tools, methodologies and standards for artefact-centred information systems in contemporary museums. One particular case in point is CLIO, a semantic information system intended for research use, developed by ICS/FORTH and the Benaki Museum in Greece in the early 1990s, which became a foundation for the definition of the Conceptual Reference Model of the International Documentation Committee of ICOM (CIDOC CRM), recently adopted as the ISO standard for cultural information representation. It is argued here that, as the capabilities of computer applications to provide access to complex, multimedia cultural information increase, so does also the validity and importance of earlier research advances in artefact-centred archaeological computing; and, conversely, that the advent of digital infrastructures for material culture disciplines such as archaeology highlights the pertinence, and potential benefits, of further work on archaeological formal analysis and knowledge representation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Dallas","given":"Costis"}],"citation-key":"dallas2009","container-title":"Archeologia e Calcolatori n.

  {"id":"dallas2015","abstract":"As a “grand challenge” for digital archaeology, I propose the adoption of programmatic research to meet the challenges of archaeological curation in the digital continuum, contingent on curation-enabled global digital infrastructures, and on contested regimes of archaeological knowledge production and meaning making. My motivation stems from an interest in the sociotechnical practices of archaeology, viewed as purposeful activities centred on material traces of past human presence. This is exemplified in contemporary practices of interpretation “at the trowel’s edge”, in epistemological reflexivity and in pluralization of archaeological knowledge. Adopting a practice-centred approach, I examine how the archaeological record is constructed and curated through archaeological activity “from the field to the screen” in a variety of archaeological situations. I call attention to Çatalhöyük as a salient case study illustrating the ubiquity of digital curation practices in experimental, well-resourced and purposefully theorized archaeological fieldwork, and I propose a conceptualization of digital curation as a pervasive, epistemic-pragmatic activity extending across the lifecycle of archaeological work. To address these challenges, I introduce a medium-term research agenda that speaks both to epistemic questions of theory in archaeology and information science, and to pragmatic concerns of digital curation, its methods, and application in archaeology. The agenda I propose calls for multidisciplinary, multi-team, multiyear research of a programmatic nature, aiming to re-examine archaeological ontology, to conduct focused research on pervasive archaeological research practices and methods, and to design and develop curation functionalities coupled with existing pervasive digital infrastructures used by archaeologists. It has a potential value in helping to establish an epistemologically coherent framework for the interdisciplinary field of archaeological curation, in aligning archaeological ontologies work with practice-based, agencyoriented and participatory theorizations of material culture, and in matching the specification and design of archaeological digital infrastructures with the increasingly globalized, ubiquitous and pervasive digital information environment and the multiple contexts of contemporary meaning-making in archaeology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Dallas","given":"Costis"}],"citation-key":"dallas2015","container-title":"Open Archaeology","DOI":"10.1515/opar-2015-0011","ISSN":"2300-6560","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"176–207","title":"Curating Archaeological Knowledge in the Digital Continuum: From Practice to Infrastructure","title-short":"Curating Archaeological Knowledge in the Digital Continuum","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/opar.2014.1.issue-1/opar-2015-0011/opar-2015-0011.xml","volume":"1"},

Pointing at Gardin’s ambivalence vis-à-vis the promises of automated classification and machine reasoning in archaeology, it shows that his approach goes beyond a normative, positivist conception of archaeological research, recognizing the contextual, theory-laden nature of archaeological data constitution, the priority of focusing on actual archaeological interpretation practices and the complementarity between narrative and formal representations of archaeological reasoning. It connects his early development of archaeological descriptive and typological metalanguages with his later elaboration of a theoretically informed approach to archaeological argumentation, analysis and publication, situates his logicist programme as a relevant contribution to the development of an archaeological “theory of practice”, grounded on reflexivity and modesty vis-à-vis the possibility of knowledge and the limits of scientism, and highlights aspects of Gardin’s work that point to potentially fruitful directions for contemporary research and practice in the field of archaeological informatics and digital humanities communication.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Dallas","given":"Costis"}],"citation-key":"dallas2016","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-015-9241-3","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"305-330","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Jean-Claude Gardin on Archaeological Data, Representation and Knowledge: Implications for Digital Archaeology","title-short":"Jean-Claude Gardin on Archaeological Data, Representation and Knowledge","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-015-9241-3","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"dallas2016a","abstract":"This paper advocates the necessity of developing a pragmatic alternative to the dominant custodial theorization of digital curation as an “umbrella concept for digital preservation, data curation, electronic records, and digital asset management”. Starting from a historical account and an examination of prevalent definitions, it points to the current dependence of digital curation on a prescriptive approach rooted in its cognate field of digital preservation, aiming to serve the needs of professional stewardship. It demonstrates the disconnect of this theorization with the rich historical traditions of museum curatorship where the notion of curation originated, its inability to act as a framework for understanding the diversity and pervasiveness of contemporary digital curation practices “in the wild” (such as content curation, personal archiving, and pro-am digitization), and its dependence on a “wild frontier” ideology dissonant with contemporary critical cultural heritage scholarship. The alternative, pragmatic approach views digital curation as a “contact zone” practice, routinely performed by a broad range of actors including researchers, artists, users, and communities, on dynamically evolving objects, domain knowledge representations, and interactions, beyond the curation life cycle prescribed for custodial environments. On this basis, this study calls for a formal reconceptualization of digital curation, adequate knowledge representation of its objects, evidence-based research on curation practices, and establishment of curation-enabled digital infrastructures suitable for curation in the continuum. Reaching beyond a custodial view, this approach aims to establish digital curation as a field of intellectual inquiry relevant to emerging pervasive curation practices in the digital environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Dallas","given":"Costis"}],"citation-key":"dallas2016a","container-title":"Archival Science","container-title-short":"Arch Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s10502-015-9252-6","ISSN":"1389-0166, 1573-7519","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12,1]]},"language":"english","page":"421–457","title":"Digital curation beyond the “Wild frontier”: A pragmatic approach","title-short":"Digital curation beyond the “Wild frontier”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10502-015-9252-6","volume":"16"},

Spatial turns, material turns and the ontological turn have directed the discipline away from its hard-won battle to find humanity in the past. Meanwhile, popularised science, camouflaged as archaeology, produces shock headlines built on ancient DNA that reduce humanity's most intriguing historical problems to two-dimensional caricatures. Today archaeology finds itself less able than ever to proclaim its relevance to the modern world. This volume foregrounds the relevance of the scholarship of John Barrett to this crisis. Twenty-four writers representing three generations of archaeologists scrutinise the current turmoil in the discipline and highlight the resolutions that may be found through Barrett's analytical framework. Topics include archaeology and the senses, the continuing problem of the archaeological record, practice, discourse, and agency, reorienting archaeological field practice, the question of different expressions of human diversity, and material ecologies. Understanding archaeology as both a universal and highly specific discipline, case-studies range from the Aegean to Orkney, and encompass Anatolia, Korea, Romania, United Kingdom and the very nature of the Universe itself. This critical examination of John Barrett's contribution to archaeology is simultaneously a response to his urgent call to arms to reorient archaeology in the service of humanity\"--","author":[{"family":"Damilati","given":"Krysti"},{"family":"Vavouranakis","given":"Giorgos"}],"citation-key":"damilati2021","container-title":"Far from equilibrium: an archaeology of energy, life and humanity: a response to the archaeology of John C.

  {"id":"daniels2014","abstract":"In recent years, data reuse has become a prominent goal in a number of disciplines, in recognition of the potential of new combinations and analyses of data to address new questions. While data sharing infrastructure supporting research communities has grown, so too has a body of literature addressing the barriers to data reuse. One institution largely omitted from examinations of data reuse, however, is the museum. Museums hold vast collections related to natural and human history which function as data sources in the work of many researchers. Decisions made by museum staff about methods of data selection, validation, and representation have important implications for future research use. However, little is known about the ways that researchers find, evaluate, and interpret data in museums. In response to this gap, I developed two research questions. First, what is the relationship between museum objects, their representations, and research use? Second, what factors influence the practices of staff members as they describe and manage museum data? I addressed these questions through a comparative case study of the data practices of staff and researchers using two museum collections, an archaeology museum and a herbarium. I conducted 45 semi-structured interviews with staff members and researchers between the two sites, supplementing this primary data with non-participant observation of the data practices of six of these individuals, and with archival research into the historical factors influencing the representation and use of data at the two museums. The main contribution of this work is an understanding of how researchers utilize museum data in two domains. Researchers used complex accumulations of museum objects and their representations to address different types of research goals, applying the evidential norms of their research communities to their approach to data. I characterized their use of research data as primarily type-based, involving comparative analysis of objects, or provenance-based, in which documentation of an object’s source was the most vital information. The study contributes a nuanced understanding of the work of collection managers and curators to increase the value and accessibility of museum data through the application of their own expertise in information systems and content.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Daniels","given":"Morgan G."}],"citation-key":"daniels2014","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"publisher":"University of Michigan","source":"Google Scholar","title":"Data Reuse in Museum Contexts: Experiences of Archaeologists and Botanists","title-short":"Data Reuse in Museum Contexts","type":"thesis","URL":"http://search.proquest.com/openview/3f6e14883874d5c73986c09d644ca89d/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y"},
  {"id":"danis2019","abstract":"In this article, I explore how digital data collection in the context of the Berkeley-Abiquiú Collaborative Archaeology (BACA) project works, some of the affordances of this new-ish technology, and how they articulate with analogue art practices to achieve the goals of engaged research. Thinking with affordances helps me reflect critically on what digital data recording offers our research goals. In this case, the most important aspect of using digital data recording is how it changes our relationship to time. New orientations of research time created by such technology is an opportunity to engage creatively with how archaeology can represent complexity, produce embodied experience, and share senses of place through both digital and analogue practices. As archaeologists trying to think trans-humanistically, we need to reflect critically on digital technologies to produce engaged research. This is always a shifting target. New uses reveal new possibilities, and vice versa. But newness is not what makes an impact, a difference, or changes the way we do research together; what makes a difference is the result, effects, and affects of these affordances., Dans cet article, l'auteur examine comment les données numériques sont acquises dans le cadre du projet Berkeley-Abiquiú Collaborative Archaeology (BACA), les potentialités (affordances) de cette technologie relativement nouvelle et son articulation avec la pratique de l'art pour atteindre les objectifs d'une recherche engagée. Une démarche incluant ces affordances permet à l'auteur de jeter un regard critique sur ce que l'enregistrement de données numériques peut contribuer à nos recherches. Dans le cas étudié, l'aspect le plus important de l'enregistrement des données numériques est qu'il change notre rapport avec le temps. La technologie nous permet de poursuivre de nouvelles orientations et offre les moyens de réfléchir de manière créative sur la complexité en archéologie, de produire des expériences incarnées et de partager un sens de l'espace à travers des pratiques tant numériques qu'analogues. En tant qu'archéologues travaillant dans un esprit transhumaniste, nous devons procéder à une réflexion critique sur les possibilités de poursuivre des recherches engagées que le numérique offre. Mais cet objectif est en mouvement constant. De nouvelles applications créent de nouvelles possibilités et vice versa. Ce n'est pas la nouveauté qui fait impression, change la donne ou modifie nos manières de collaborer ; ce qui importe, ce sont les résultats, les répercussions et les réactions que provoquent ces affordances. Translation by Madeleine Hummler, In diesem Artikel untersuche ich die Anwendung der digitalen Datenfassung im Rahmen eines archäologischen Projektes, das Berkeley-Abiquiú Collaborative Archaeology (BACA) Projekt, und überlege über die fördernden und hemmenden Eigenschaften (Affordanz) dieser recht neuen Technologie und über ihren Zusammenhang mit der Praxis der Kunst, um die Ziele einer engagierten Forschung zu erreichen. Ein Bezug auf den Begriff der Affordanz hilft dabei, kritisch darüber nachzudenken, was die digitale Datenfassung zu unseren Forschungszielen beiträgt. Im vorliegenden Fall war die Veränderung unser Verhältnis zur Zeit der wichtigste Aspekt der Anwendung der digitalen Datenfassung. Die Technologie ermöglichte es, durch die Anwendung von digitalen und analogen Mitteln, neue Forschungsrichtungen zu folgen, über die Darstellung der Komplexität in der Archäologie kreativ zu denken, verkörperte Erlebnisse zu fördern und ein Gefühl für die Bedeutung eines Ortes zu teilen. Als Archäologen, die versuchen, transhumanistisch zu denken, müssen wir kritisch über die digitalen Technologien nachdenken und dessen Fähigkeit, engagierte Forschungsrichtungen zu entwickeln. Aber die Ziele verschieben sich immer wieder; neue Anwendungen bringen neue Möglichkeiten und umgekehrt. Es ist nicht die Neuigkeit, die etwas prägt oder eine Rolle spielt, oder die Art und Weise unserer wissenschaftlichen Zusammenarbeit verändert; der Unterschied liegt in den Ergebnissen, den Auswirkungen und den Einflüssen dieser neuen Affordanz.

At first glance, ideal preservation actions retain every aspect of the original objects with the highest level of fidelity. Achieving this goal can, however, be costly, infeasible, and sometimes even undesirable. As a result, custodians must focus their attention on preserving the most significant characteristics of the content, even at the cost of sacrificing less important ones. The concept of significant characteristics has become prominent within the digital preservation community to capture this key goal. As is often the case in an emerging field, however, the term has become over-loaded and remains ill-defined.

  {"id":"davies2018","abstract":"Evidence for changes in human mobility is fundamental to interpretations of transitions in human socioeconomic organization. Showing changes in mobility requires both archaeological proxies that are sensitive to movement and a clear understanding of how different mobility configurations influence their patterning. This study uses computer simulation to explore how different combinations of reduction, selection, transport, and discard of stone artifacts generate patterning in the “cortex ratio,” a geometric proxy used to demonstrate movement at the assemblage level. A case study from western New South Wales, Australia, shows how cortex ratios are used to make inferences about movement. Results of the exploratory simulation show that redundancy in movement between discards reduces variability in cortex ratios, while mean assemblage values can be attributed to the relative proportions of artifacts carried into and out of the assemblages. These results suggest that raw material availability is a potentially crucial factor in determining what kinds of mobility are visible in assemblages, whereby different access to raw material can shift the balance of import and export of stone in an otherwise undirected movement configuration. These findings are used to contextualize distributions of cortex ratios from the raw material–rich study area, prompting suggestions for further fieldwork., Las evidencias sobre cambios en la movilidad humana constituyen un dato fundamental para desarrollar interpretaciones sobre los procesos de transición en la organización socioeconómica de lo grupos humanos. La identificación de cambios en la movilidad requiere tanto de indicadores arqueológicos que reflejan el movimiento de grupos humanos como de un entendimiento claro de la influencia de diferentes configuraciones de movilidad sobre los patrones generados por las mismas. El presente estudio utiliza software de simulación computacional para explorar cómo diferentes combinaciones de reducción, selección, transporte y desecho de artefactos líticos generan distintos patrones en la proporción de córtex, medida geométrica utilizada como índice de movimiento a nivel del conjunto lítico. El presente estudio fue realizado con base en datos provenientes del oeste de la región de New South Wales en Australia, y muestra cómo se pueden utilizar las proporciones de córtex para generar inferencias sobre la movilidad. Los resultados de simulaciones exploratorias muestran que la redundancia en el movimiento humano con respecto a las actividades de desecho reduce la variabilidad en las proporciones de córtex, mientras que los valores promedio pueden ser atribuidos a las proporciones relativas de artefactos ingresados o eliminados de los conjuntos líticos. Estos resultados sugieren que la disponibilidad de materias primas es un factor potencialmente crucial para determinar qué tipos de movilidad pueden detectarse a partir de un conjunto lítico, pues diferentes tipos de acceso a las materias primas pueden desplazar el equilibrio entre importación y exportación de materiales líticos, en una configuración que de otra forma se presentaría como resultado de movilidad aleatoria. Se emplean estos resultados para contextualizar la distribución de las proporciones de córtex provenientes del área de estudio, la cual es rica en materias primas, y permite elaborar sugerencias para futuros trabajos de campo.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Davies","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Holdaway","given":"Simon J."},{"family":"Fanning","given":"Patricia C."}],"citation-key":"davies2018","container-title":"American Antiquity","DOI":"10.1017/aaq.2018.23","ISSN":"0002-7316, 2325-5064","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7]]},"language":"en","page":"444-461","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"MODELING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SPACE, MOVEMENT, AND LITHIC GEOMETRIC ATTRIBUTES","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/modeling-relationships-between-space-movement-and-lithic-geometric-attributes/0A758BEC8978627BC11CFDF5BFEAA02D?utm_source=SFMC&utm_medium=email&utm_content=https%3a%2f%2fwww.cambridge.org%2fcore%2fjournals%2famerican-antiquity%2farticle%2fmodeling-relationships-between-space-movement-and-lithic-geometric-attributes%2f0A758BEC8978627BC11CFDF5BFEAA02D&utm_campaign=KPT_SAA_Oct+2018_+20181009_154854&WT.mc_id=KPT_SAA_Oct+2018_+20181009_154854","volume":"83"},

  {"id":"dawdy2010","abstract":"This essay identifies the potential of an emerging archaeological turn for anthropology—and for archaeology itself. I argue that despite the critiques of the past two decades, the temporality of modernity and a belief in its exceptionalism still structure much of anthropological thought, as exemplified in the division of archaeology and ethnography and in the subfield of historical archaeology and its dystopic treatment of modern urban ruins. But alternative temporalities and analytical possibilities are also emerging, ones attentive to the folding and recycling of cultural elements that Walter Benjamin described with such philosophical depth. On the ground, Benjamin’s insights can be put to use by paying greater attention to the spatiotemporal dynamics of capitalism’s creative destruction, to the social life of ruins, and to projects that challenge the linear divide between modernity and antiquity. Releasing anthropology from progressive time necessarily entails a reintegration of the subfields and a direct engagement with recent ruins.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Dawdy","given":"Shannon Lee"}],"citation-key":"dawdy2010","container-title":"Current Anthropology","container-title-short":"Current Anthropology","DOI":"10.1086/657626","ISSN":"0011-3204","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",12,1]]},"page":"761-793","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Clockpunk Anthropology and the Ruins of Modernity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/657626","volume":"51"},
  {"id":"dawson2022","abstract":"Digital images are produced by humans and autonomous devices everywhere and, increasingly, ‘everywhen’. Legacy image data, like Mary Shelley’s infamous monster, can be stitched together as either smooth and eloquent, or jagged and abominable, supplementary combinations from various times to create a thought-provoking and/or repulsive Frankensteinian assemblage composed, like most archaeological assemblages, of messy temporal components combining, as Gavin Lucas sums it up, as “a mixture of things from different times and with different life histories but which co-exist here and now”. In this paper, we take a subversive Virtual Art/Archaeology approach, adopting Jacques Derrida’s notion of the ‘supplement’, to explore the temporality of archaeological legacy images, introducing the concept of timesheds or temporal brackets within aggregated images. The focus of this temporally blurred, and time-glitched, study is the World Heritage Site of the Neolithic to Common Era henge monument of Avebury, UK (United Kingdom).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Dawson","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Andrew Meirion"},{"family":"Minkin","given":"Louisa"},{"family":"Reilly","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"dawson2022","container-title":"Digital","DOI":"10.3390/digital2020015","ISSN":"2673-6470","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"2","page":"244-266","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Temporal Frankensteins and Legacy Images","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2673-6470/2/2/15","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"day2019","abstract":"Materials used in the construction of man-made structures can reveal information about societies, their environment, culture and mobility. Cultures throughout human history have used natural stone to construct funerary monuments and tool technologies. Stone materials from igneous rocks can be provenanced by petrographic examination and geochemical methods that provide a direct link between the artefact and their source. For sedimentary sarsen stones, provenance is often complicated by diagenetic processes acting on source rocks. Here I use an example of stones used to build 6000-year-old earth and sarsen megalith structures from the River Medway valley (Kent, UK). These megalith structures lie on the strategic and pre-Neolithic North Downs migration route into Britain, but the provenance of the sarsens used in their construction has not been established. The highly competent sarsens are diagenetic groundwater silcretes, resulting from acid leaching of glauconitic clay components, and addition of a quartz cement. Heavy rare earth and high field strength element abundances and ratios are resistant to diagenetic effects and show a geochemical association with Paleogene sandstones from the Upnor Formation of the Lambeth Group at the 95% confidence limit. Detrital zircon and titanite grain compositions confirm this relationship. Preferential erosion and removal of the less competent sandstone around silcretes left large (>2 m), durable and isolated sarsen blocks on top of the chalk downs that were subsequently exploited by Neolithic peoples. Use of local stone to construct the Medway megaliths is consistent with their distinct morphological characteristics that have been used to imply independence from continental European cultures at that time. Combined with careful field collection of possible source rocks and sarsen materials, provenance of stones of sedimentary origin that have been affected by diagenesis can be accurately assessed through a combination of petrography, bulk-rock heavy rare earth element and high field strength element abundances, and detrital mineral compositions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Day","given":"James M.

  {"id":"dejuanares2019","abstract":"This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of glass compositions from Visigothic Spain using high resolution laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Major, minor and trace element patterns of 169 well-dated samples from three rural Iberian sites (Congosto, Gózquez and El Pelícano) have brought to light major chronological developments in the production, circulation and use of glass between the fifth and the eighth century CE. The data identify four distinct compositional groups of Egyptian and Levantine origin. Egyptian Foy 2.1, Foy 2.1 high Fe and so-called Magby alongside Apollonia-type Levantine I were the main glass types of the Visigothic period. Due to the tight dating of the majority of the samples, we were able to reveal fundamental changes in the geographical scope of glass supplies to the Iberian Peninsula, and to refine the chronological range of the known primary production groups. The glass group commonly known as série 2.1 or Foy 2.1 started being produced already during the second half of the fifth century. The appearance of Foy 2.1 high Fe can likewise be moved forward to the first half of the sixth century. A plant-ash group referred to as Magby was introduced around the middle of the sixth century. Egypt was undeniably the main supplier of raw glasses to the Iberian Peninsula up to the mid-sixth century CE, after which the Levantine I group became the prime glass type among the analysed assemblages. In the final stages of the Visigothic Kingdom and the early years of Islamic dominion, there is a noticeable drop in the absolute quantity of glass available, together with an increase in recycling. The implications of these transformations in the supply of glass for the organisation of Mediterranean trade are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"De Juan Ares","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Vigil-Escalera Guirado","given":"Alfonso"},{"family":"Cáceres Gutiérrez","given":"Yasmina"},{"family":"Schibille","given":"Nadine"}],"citation-key":"dejuanares2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2019.04.006","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,1]]},"page":"23-31","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Changes in the supply of eastern Mediterranean glasses to Visigothic Spain","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440319300366","volume":"107"},

It starts with a reading of Bruno Latour’s notion of ‘matters of concern’ as favouring an awareness of the ethico-political effects of constructivist accounts in STS. Introducing attention to concern brings us closer to a notion of care. However, there is a ‘critical’ edge to care that Latour’s politics of things tends to disregard. Drawing upon feminist knowledge politics, I propose to treat matters of fact and sociotechnical assemblages as ‘matters of care’ and argue that engaging with care requires a speculative commitment to neglected things.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Bellacasa","given":"Maria Puig","non-dropping-particle":"de la"}],"citation-key":"delabellacasa2011","container-title":"Social Studies of Science","DOI":"10.1177/0306312710380301","ISSN":"0306-3127, 1460-3659","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",2]]},"language":"en","page":"85-106","source":"Crossref","title":"Matters of care in technoscience: Assembling neglected things","title-short":"Matters of care in technoscience","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0306312710380301","volume":"41"},

This turns out to be what we call the `fluidity' of the pump (of its boundaries, or of its working order, and of its maker). We find that in travelling to intractable places, an object that isn't too rigorously bounded, that doesn't impose itself but tries to serve, that is adaptable, flexible and responsive - in short, a fluid object - may well prove to be stronger than one which is firm. By analyzing the success and failure of this device, its agency and the way in which it shapes new configurations in the Zimbabwean socio-technical landscape, we partake in the current move in science and technology studies to transform what it means to be an actor. And by mobilizing the term love for articulating our relation to the Bush Pump, we try to contribute to shaping novel ways of `doing' normativity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Laet","given":"Marianne","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Mol","given":"Annemarie"}],"citation-key":"delaet2000","container-title":"Social Studies of Science","container-title-short":"Soc Stud Sci","DOI":"10.1177/030631200030002002","ISSN":"0306-3127","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"225-263","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Zimbabwe Bush Pump: Mechanics of a Fluid Technology","title-short":"The Zimbabwe Bush Pump","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/030631200030002002","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"denning2010","abstract":"The debate about the wisdom of sending interstellar transmissions is well-known to those involved in SETI, and frustrating for many. Its tendency towards intractability is a result of multiple factors, including: different models of the scientist's role as citizen and/or leader; disparate ideas about society's readiness to cope with frontier science; variable political substrates, particularly ideas concerning individual freedom and state control; competing ideologies of globalization; and the perceived relative risks and benefits of contact. (Variations in the latter, i.e. assessments of the risks and benefits of contact, derive partly from different thinking styles, including tolerance for risk, and partly from inferences based upon episodes of biological and cultural contact on Earth.)

  {"id":"denning2011","abstract":"SETI’s essential premises involve evolution in multiple domains: cosmology, biology, culture, and technology. Comparatively little has been written about the last of these, technology, in relation to SETI’s targets, but it is a crucial variable, and well worth deep examination. In particular, it would seem prudent to consider carefully our assumptions about hypothetical extraterrestrial societies which have developed technology that SETI could detect, or which could detect, at interstellar distances, the existence of intelligent life on Earth. This chapter contributes to that effort by reflecting upon our habits of projecting terracentric assumptions onto hypothetical worlds, exploring dominant narratives about technological development, and presenting varied philosophical theories about the nature of technology. It highlights the cultural aspects of technology here on Earth, particularly their role in the development of radio technology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Denning","given":"Kathryn"}],"citation-key":"denning2011","collection-title":"The Frontiers Collection","container-title":"Searching for Extraterrestrial Intelligence: SETI Past, Present, and Future","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-642-13196-7_25","editor":[{"family":"Shuch","given":"H.

  {"id":"denning2011a","abstract":"Ten thousand years ago, no-one on Earth was living a “civilized” life. What has happened since is remarkable and impossible to fully comprehend; yet, everyone has ideas about civilization, and how the world came to be as it is. Such understandings of civilizations on Earth inevitably influence speculation about extraterrestrial civilizations, in two ways. First, sometimes a specific Earth civilization or historical experience is explicitly used as a basis for inferences about extraterrestrial civilizations. Second, more general assumptions about the development and functioning of Earth's societies shape conjectures about alien societies. This paper focuses on the latter, general assumptions, with the aim of considering how we can use multidisciplinary approaches, and our knowledge of Earth's civilizations, to our best advantage in SETI.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Denning","given":"Kathryn"}],"citation-key":"denning2011a","collection-title":"SETI Special Edition","container-title":"Acta Astronautica","container-title-short":"Acta Astronautica","DOI":"10.1016/j.actaastro.2009.11.019","ISSN":"0094-5765","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",2,1]]},"page":"381-388","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Ten thousand revolutions: conjectures about civilizations","title-short":"Ten thousand revolutions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576509005694","volume":"68"},

  {"id":"deroo2016","abstract":"Accurate and detailed data recording is indispensable for documenting archeological projects and for subsequent information exchange. To prevent comprehension and accessibility issues in these cases, data infrastructures can be useful. The establishment of such data infrastructures requires a clear understanding of the business processes and information flows within the archeological domain. This study attempts to provide insights into how information is managed in Flemish archeological processes and how this management process can be enhanced: an exploratory study based on an analysis of the new Flemish Immovable Heritage Decree, informal interviews with Flemish archeological organizations, and the results of an international survey. Three main processes, in which certified archeologists and the Flemish Heritage agency are key actors, were identified. Multiple types of information, the majority of which contain a geographical component, are recorded, acquired, used, and exchanged. Geographical information systems GIS and geodatabases therefore appear to be valuable components of an archeology-specific data infrastructure. This is of interest because GIS are widely adopted in archeology and multiple Flemish archeological organizations are in favor of a government-provided exchange standard or database templates for data recording. Furthermore, free and open source software is preferred to ensure cost efficiency and customizability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"De Roo","given":"Berdien"},{"family":"De Maeyer","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Bourgeois","given":"Jean"}],"citation-key":"deroo2016","container-title":"J.

These theoretical turns swirl alongside the ongoing development and adoption of scientific and digital techniques that have wide-ranging implications for archaeological practices and interpretations. Two particularly combustible developments are posthumanism and the ontological turn, which emerged within the broader humanities and social sciences. Posthumanism rejects human exceptionalism and seeks to de-centre humans in archaeological discourse and practice. Linked to this is the so-called ‘ontological turn’ (aka the ‘material turn’), a shift away from framing archaeological research within a Western ontology and a movement beyond representationalism (i.e. focusing on things themselves rather than assuming that objects represent something else).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Díaz-Guardamino","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Morgan","given":"Colleen"}],"citation-key":"diaz-guardamino2019","container-title":"European Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.1017/eaa.2019.26","ISSN":"1461-9571, 1741-2722","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8]]},"language":"en","page":"320-323","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Human, Transhuman, Posthuman Digital Archaeologies: An Introduction","title-short":"Human, Transhuman, Posthuman Digital Archaeologies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-journal-of-archaeology/article/human-transhuman-posthuman-digital-archaeologies-an-introduction/9E998CD5CB3CCFF0AA14ED32A78ED14D","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"diaz2013","abstract":"Great advances in analytical technology coupled with accelerated new drug development and growing understanding of biological challenges, such as tumor heterogeneity, have required a change in the focus for biobanking. Most current banks contain samples of primary tumors, but linking molecular signatures to therapeutic questions requires serial biopsies in the setting of metastatic disease, next-generation of biobanking. Furthermore, an integration of multidimensional analysis of various molecular components, that is, RNA, DNA, methylome, microRNAome and post-translational modifications of the proteome, is necessary for a comprehensive view of a tumor’s biology. While data using such biopsies are now regularly presented, the preanalytical variables in tissue procurement and processing in multicenter studies are seldom detailed and therefore are difficult to duplicate or standardize across sites and across studies. In the context of a biopsy-driven clinical trial, we generated a detailed protocol that includes morphological evaluation and isolation of high-quality nucleic acids from small needle core biopsies obtained from liver metastases. The protocol supports stable shipping of samples to a central laboratory, where biopsies are subsequently embedded in support media. Designated pathologists must evaluate all biopsies for tumor content and macrodissection can be performed if necessary to meet our criteria of >60% neoplastic cells and <20% necrosis for genomic isolation. We validated our protocol in 40 patients who participated in a biopsy-driven study of therapeutic resistance in metastatic colorectal cancer. To ensure that our protocol was compatible with multiplex discovery platforms and that no component of the processing interfered with downstream enzymatic reactions, we performed array comparative genomic hybridization, methylation profiling, microRNA profiling, splicing variant analysis and gene expression profiling using genomic material isolated from liver biopsy cores. Our standard operating procedures for next-generation biobanking can be applied widely in multiple settings, including multicentered and international biopsy-driven trials.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Diaz","given":"Zuanel"},{"family":"Aguilar-Mahecha","given":"Adriana"},{"family":"Paquet","given":"Eric R."},{"family":"Basik","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Orain","given":"Michèle"},{"family":"Camlioglu","given":"Errol"},{"family":"Constantin","given":"André"},{"family":"Benlimame","given":"Naciba"},{"family":"Bachvarov","given":"Dimcho"},{"family":"Jannot","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Simard","given":"Martin J."},{"family":"Chabot","given":"Benoit"},{"family":"Gologan","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Klinck","given":"Roscoe"},{"family":"Gagnon-Kugler","given":"Thérèse"},{"family":"Lespérance","given":"Bernard"},{"family":"Samson","given":"Benoit"},{"family":"Kavan","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Alcindor","given":"Thierry"},{"family":"Dalfen","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Lan","given":"Cathy"},{"family":"Chabot","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Buchanan","given":"Marguerite"},{"family":"Przybytkowski","given":"Ewa"},{"family":"Qureshi","given":"Samia"},{"family":"Rousseau","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Spatz","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Têtu","given":"Bernard"},{"family":"Batist","given":"Gerald"}],"citation-key":"diaz2013","container-title":"Modern Pathology","DOI":"10.1038/modpathol.2013.81","ISSN":"1530-0285","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",11]]},"language":"en","license":"2013 Nature Publishing Group","page":"1413-1424","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Next-generation biobanking of metastases to enable multidimensional molecular profiling in personalized medicine","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/modpathol201381","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"dibble2017","abstract":"While lithic objects can potentially inform us about past adaptations and behaviors, it is important to develop a comprehensive understanding of all of the various processes that influence what we recover from the archaeological record. We argue here that many assumptions used by archaeologists to derive behavioral inferences through the definition, conceptualization, and interpretation of both individual stone artifact forms and groups of artifacts identified as assemblages do not fit squarely with what we have learned from both ethnographic sources and analyses of archaeological materials. We discuss this in terms of two fallacies. The first is the fallacy of the “desired end product” in stone artifact manufacture, which also includes our ability to recognize such end products. The second fallacy has to do with the notions that lithic assemblages represent simple accumulations of contemporary behaviors and the degree to which the composition of the depositional units we study reliably match the kinds of activities that took place. Although it is beyond the scope of this paper to offer a comprehensive set of new methodologies and theoretical perspectives to solve these problems, our goal here is to stress the importance of rethinking some of our most basic assumptions regarding the nature of lithic objects and how they become part of the archaeological record.

Initial publication concluded that a relative increase in cattle in the Early Iron Age settlement indicated a shift to beef ranching. Without access to original archaeological contexts, geoarchaeological analyses were conducted on intact aggregates of sediment from unwashed bags of bone. The results reveal that material underwent differential attrition, likely related to depth from surface, that affected the composition of chronologically sensitive assemblages. The increased presence of cattle in the Early Iron Age is, therefore, more likely related to differential preservation. Well-preserved Early Iron Age assemblages do not show an increased presence in cattle, and similar mortality profiles between the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age suggest animal management strategies remained broadly similar.

  {"id":"digiuseppantoniodifranco2015","abstract":"This study uses a novel, interdisciplinary approach to investigate how people describe ancient artefacts. Here, we focus on gestures. Researchers have shown that gestures are important in communication, and those researchers often make a distinction between beat and iconic gestures. Iconic gestures convey meaning, specifically, visual-spatial information. Beat gestures do not convey meaning; they facilitate lexical access. In our study, we videotaped participants while they described artefacts presented through varied media: visual examination, physical interaction, and three-dimensional virtual and material replica (i.e., 3D prints) interaction. Video analysis revealed that media type affected gesture production. Participants who viewed actual objects displayed in a museum-style case produced few gestures in their descriptions.

  {"id":"dimaio2018","abstract":"The archaeological site of Nora is built on a large peninsula that marks the Gulf of Cagliari (Sardinia island, Italy) at its southernmost part. As for most of the ancient coastal cities, the study of Nora is rather complex because of the partial (or complete) burial or submergence of the archaeological remains and their degradation induced by the progressive seawater entry. In recent years, an extensive multi-disciplinary research project, which involves disciplines varying from archeology to earth sciences, has started. In particular, in this paper the results of a high-resolution multi-methodological geophysical prospecting focused on the coastal area between land and sea, not considered in previous urban and marine archaeological researches, are reported and integrated with new archaeological data. The interpretation of the geophysical anomalies is well supported by the results of an archaeological excavation in the north-western sector of the survey area and suggests, in the eastern (not excavated) sector, the presence of buried structures that could lead to redraw the urban settlement of the area, with housing blocks connected by paved open spaces. Furthermore, the geophysical survey clearly identifies the sharp lowering of the andesitic bedrock from the foot of the Coltellazzo hill to the west, offering fundamental data to reconstruct the paleo-environmental landscape of the ancient settlement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Di Maio","given":"Rosa"},{"family":"La Manna","given":"Mauro"},{"family":"Piegari","given":"Ester"},{"family":"Zara","given":"Arturo"},{"family":"Bonetto","given":"Jacopo"}],"citation-key":"dimaio2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2018.05.003","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,1]]},"page":"230-238","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Reconstruction of a Mediterranean coast archaeological site by integration of geophysical and archaeological data: The eastern district of the ancient city of Nora (Sardinia, Italy)","title-short":"Reconstruction of a Mediterranean coast archaeological site by integration of geophysical and archaeological data","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18301226","volume":"20"},
  {"id":"diolatzis2019","abstract":"One undeniable characteristic of Antikythera mechanism is the complex gear arrangements that generously have been used by the constructor. He succeeded the best combination of integer numbers to reach the maximum accuracy, no matter the number of the gears he used for it. One representative example is the “moon train” consisted of eleven meshing gears which he used to simulate the non-uniform lunar motion. Someone could say that the constructor preferred the complexity for the sake of accuracy. Many Scholars, believe that the mechanism could be a kind of planetarium. In that case, there is a possibility of a more complex mechanical subsystem comprised of more imaginative and specialized gear arrangements. The latest decoded inscriptions on the mechanism's surfaces, are referred to planets (Inferiors and Superiors) and show records of astronomical events. The lack of physical evidence of this planetary construction prevents its conception, but on the other hand, challenges the researchers to discover the inimitable thought of its creator. Nevertheless, fitting this excess gearing in a limited space of a compact construction like Antikythera mechanism is really a puzzler. The planetary subsystem which will complete the mechanism should stand out for the maximum possible measurement accuracy and the best space management. This research proposes a feasible epicyclic gearing specialized for a compact planetary construction achieving the highest possible accuracy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Diolatzis","given":"Ioannis S."},{"family":"Pavlogeorgatos","given":"Gerasimos"}],"citation-key":"diolatzis2019","container-title":"Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage","container-title-short":"Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage","DOI":"10.1016/j.daach.2018.e00089","ISSN":"2212-0548","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,1]]},"page":"e00089","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Antikythera mechanism – A compound epicyclic gearing for Venus","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212054818300341","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"ditchfield2019","abstract":"Raw material sourcing is critical for not only understanding past mobility and stone technology but also the formation of stone artefact assemblages. Despite this, very little sourcing work has been conducted in Western Australia where stone artefacts dominate the archaeological record. This problem exists partially because of a generally complex local and regional geology. At the same time, in the wider literature, there is also a tendency to focus on sourcing non-local (>10 km) artefacts over local artefacts (<10 km). To exemplify these problems, this paper focuses on raw material sourcing in parts of the coastal Carnarvon and Pilbara, particularly Barrow Island and Cape Range. Both landscapes have long occupation histories (>40 ka). A raw material database of both local and non-local sources is proposed. This database is initially focused on macroscopic, petrographic and some geochemical analysis which can later be extended to include more detailed geochemistry. The first set of results from the database indicate that both limestone and calcrete were sourced locally, while locally available indurated rocks like sandstone have more variable source locations, including the possibility of now-drowned parts of the inner shelf. It is hoped that this study may be translated to other parts of Australia and beyond, where there are similar complexities in sourcing of stone artefacts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Ditchfield","given":"Kane"},{"family":"Ward","given":"Ingrid"}],"citation-key":"ditchfield2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.02.012","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"page":"539-555","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Local lithic landscapes and local source complexity: Developing a new database for geological sourcing of archaeological stone artefacts in North-Western Australia","title-short":"Local lithic landscapes and local source complexity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18306084","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"doelle2016","abstract":"The increasing importance of landscape-scale research and preservation goals within the archaeological profession coincides with expanded threats to the archaeological record through massive energy exploration and infrastructure projects and through the cumulative effects of smaller-scale development. It is further stimulated by the recognition that conservation strategies that span multiple resource classes and disciplines are best formulated at multiple and larger spatial scales. These are key drivers behind efforts to improve the ways that archaeological resources are considered in the context of development-related planning and implementation, including mitigation measures. In a prominent example, recent department-level direction from the Secretary of the Interior calls specifically for landscape-level planning as a critical component of responses to both large-scale development and climate change. This article reviews three current approaches to landscape-level planning in archaeology and calls for increased commitment to advancing their development and effectiveness.\n, \nDentro de la arqueología, la creciente importancia de investigaciones a nivel de paisaje y objetivos de conservación coincide con nuevas amenazas al registro arqueológico creadas tanto por proyectos de exploración e infraestructura para la generación masiva de energía como por los efectos cumulativos del desarrollo en pequeña escala.

  {"id":"dolfini2018","abstract":"The replication of objects lies at the heart of material culture research in archaeology. In particular, replication plays a key role in a number of core activities in our discipline including teaching, research, and public engagement. Despite its being fundamental to the archaeological process, however, replication comes across as an under-theorised field of artefact research. The problem is compounded by the recent development of digital technologies, which add a new layer of challenges as well as opportunities to the long-established practice of making and using physical copies of objects. The paper discusses a number of issues with artefact replication including aims, design, and methodology, from the standpoint of two research projects currently coordinated by the authors: the Bronze Age Combat project, which explores prehistoric fighting techniques through field experiments and wear analysis (Dolfini); and the NU Digital Heritage project, which centres upon the digital capture and modelling of Roman material culture from Hadrian’s Wall (Collins). Both projects have actively created replicas in physical or digital media, and direct comparison of the two projects provide a number of useful lessons regarding the role, uses, and limits of artefact replication in archaeology.

  {"id":"dominguez-rodrigo2019","abstract":"Categorical variables identifying microscopic features of cut marks produce high accuracy in discrimination of bone surface modifications, but are vulnerable to variable degrees of inter-analyst subjectivity. Metric analyses of cut mark width and depth are presented by Merritt et al. (2018) as a more objective method of identifying cut marks. However, this uni(bi)variate method has shown very high rates of mark classification error when structurally similar marks are compared. Furthermore, within-sample comparison carried out via subsampling shows that different datasets of metric values, obtained with the same type of tool and raw material, are subject to such a high degree of variability that significant differences of homogeneous subsamples are repeatedly obtained, thus preventing any useful analogs to be made. Additionally, this much higher stochastic variability depends on limited knowledge of the contextual processes that intervene in cut mark metric properties, as well as on a mismatch between theoretical premises on the immanent-configurational process-trace dynamics and their confusion during experimental praxis. The selection of specific contextual variables and disregard of others, in addition to the combination of different tool types and raw materials, distorts the resulting cut mark properties. This indicates that even when attempting to use exclusively metric numeric variables, subjectivity is a conditioning factor in analyzing and interpreting cut marks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Domínguez-Rodrigo","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Saladié","given":"Palmira"},{"family":"Cáceres","given":"Isabel"},{"family":"Huguet","given":"Rosa"},{"family":"Yravedra","given":"José"},{"family":"Rodríguez-Hidalgo","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Patricia","given":"Martín"},{"family":"Antonio","given":"Pineda"},{"family":"Juan","given":"Marín"},{"family":"Clara","given":"Gené"},{"family":"Aramendi","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Cobo-Sánchez","given":"Lucia"}],"citation-key":"dominguez-rodrigo2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2018.09.003","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,1]]},"page":"80-86","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Spilled ink blots the mind: A reply to Merrit et al.

  {"id":"dorta-gonzalez2021","abstract":"Data sharing by researchers is a centerpiece of Open Science principles and scientific progress. For a sample of 6019 researchers, we analyze the extent/frequency of their data sharing. Specifically, the relationship with the following four variables: how much they value data citations, the extent to which their data-sharing activities are formally recognized, their perceptions of whether sufficient credit is awarded for data sharing, and the reported extent to which data citations motivate their data sharing. In addition, we analyze the extent to which researchers have reused openly accessible data, as well as how data sharing varies by professional age-cohort, and its relationship to the value they place on data citations. Furthermore, we consider most of the explanatory variables simultaneously by estimating a multiple linear regression that predicts the extent/frequency of their data sharing. We use the dataset of the State of Open Data Survey 2019 by Springer Nature and Digital Science. Results do allow us to conclude that a desire for recognition/credit is a major incentive for data sharing. Thus, the possibility of receiving data citations is highly valued when sharing data, especially among younger researchers, irrespective of the frequency with which it is practiced. Finally, the practice of data sharing was found to be more prevalent at late research career stages, despite this being when citations are less valued and have a lower motivational impact. This could be due to the fact that later-career researchers may benefit less from keeping their data private.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Dorta-González","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"González-Betancor","given":"Sara M."},{"family":"Dorta-González","given":"María Isabel"}],"citation-key":"dorta-gonzalez2021","container-title":"Scientometrics","container-title-short":"Scientometrics","DOI":"10.1007/s11192-021-03869-3","ISSN":"1588-2861","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2209-2225","source":"Springer Link","title":"To what extent is researchers' data-sharing motivated by formal mechanisms of recognition and credit?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-021-03869-3","volume":"126"},

Specifically, measurements of isotope (18O‰) and of chemical composition of halophytic plants, Pikrolimni Natron, sand, chert and limestone samples were conducted. The study proves that the “Chalastraion nitron”, mentioned by Pliny the Elder, as flux can be considered for glassmaking and the use of mainly chert and soil quartz of the particular region of Greece can discriminate the starting material by the δ18O of the final product. A fishable explanation for the unexpected isotopic compositions of ancient Greek glasses is presented, indicating local production of the raw glass, rather than import from Eastern Mediterranean glassmaking centers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Dotsika","given":"Elissavet"},{"family":"Ignatiadou","given":"Despoina"},{"family":"Longinelli","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Poutoukis","given":"Dimitrios"},{"family":"Diamantopoulos","given":"Georgios"}],"citation-key":"dotsika2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2017.12.030","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,10]]},"source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The fingerprint of Greek raw materials in the composition of ancient glasses with “unexpected” isotopic compositions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X17305023"},
  {"id":"douglass2018","abstract":"Artifacts with varying use-lives have different discard rates and hence are represented unequally among archaeological assemblages. As such, the ability to gauge the use-lives of artifacts is important for understanding the formation of archaeological assemblage variability. In lithic artifacts, use-life can be expressed as the extraction of utility, or work potential, from existing stone volume. Using experimental data and generalized linear modeling, this study develops models of artifact use-life on cores in the form of reduction intensity. We then apply these models to two archaeological case studies to (a) reconstruct the reduction intensities of archaeological cores and (b) investigate the survivorship curves of these archaeological cores across the reduction continuum using the Weibull function. Results indicate variation in core reduction and maintenance with respect to raw material properties and place use history and implicate evolutionary differences between Early Stone Age hominins and Holocene modern humans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Douglass","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Lin","given":"Sam C."},{"family":"Braun","given":"David R."},{"family":"Plummer","given":"Thomas W."}],"citation-key":"douglass2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-017-9334-2","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"254-288","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Core Use-Life Distributions in Lithic Assemblages as a Means for Reconstructing Behavioral Patterns","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-017-9334-2","volume":"25"},

Through a variety of projects, we asked a common set of questions about the processes that both buried and exposed these materials, the methods needed to obtain a chronology in different regions, and the ways we might interpret artifacts found together in different densities.

  {"id":"dourish2017","abstract":"An argument that the material arrangements of information -- how it is represented and interpreted -- matter significantly for our experience of information and information systems. Virtual entities that populate our digital experience, like e-books, virtual worlds, and online stores, are backed by the large-scale physical infrastructures of server farms, fiber optic cables, power plants, and microwave links. But another domain of material constraints also shapes digital living: the digital representations sketched on whiteboards, encoded into software, stored in databases, loaded into computer memory, and transmitted on networks. These digital representations encode aspects of our everyday world and make them available for digital processing. The limits and capacities of those representations carry significant consequences for digital society. In The Stuff of Bits, Paul Dourish examines the specific materialities that certain digital objects exhibit. He presents four case studies:emulation, the creation of a \"virtual\" computer inside another; digital spreadsheets and their role in organizational practice; relational databases and the issue of \"the databaseable\"; and the evolution of digital networking and the representational entailments of network protocols. These case studies demonstrate how a materialist account can offer an entry point to broader concerns -- questions of power, policy, and polity in the realm of the digital.","author":[{"family":"Dourish","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"dourish2017","edition":"1st","ISBN":"978-0-262-03620-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"publisher":"The MIT Press","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"The Stuff of Bits: An Essay on the Materialities of Information","title-short":"The Stuff of Bits","type":"book"},

  {"id":"doyon2019","abstract":"The manufacture of composite projectile technology requires the production and assemblage of tightly fitted parts designed to fulfill a number of distinct functions. Each part combines a number of techno-functional units, and various processes may be responsible for the shape variability of these units. In order to investigate the relative contribution of each process to the overall variability of a projectile implement, one must identify the point of demarcation between its techno-functional units. In the present paper, the concept of shape modularity is introduced to precisely identify this locus. The application of geometric morphometrics and shape modularity to the study of two Aurignacian osseous projectile point types, i.e., split- and massive-based points, reveals interesting patterns. On both types, the maximum width delimits the distal and proximal techno-functional units of these objects. When focusing on the morphometric variability and the geographic distribution of the implements' proximal unit, the eight shapes identified for split-based points are found over vast regions of Europe. On the other hand, the two proximal shapes defined for massive-based points show a pattern of local, or regional, aggregation. These proximal shapes were likely considered fit for hafting and hunting by the prehistoric populations who reproduced them, and they are interpreted as a proxy for the socially shared rules of production that guided the manufacture of these tool types. They could therefore be used in future studies that aim to identify group membership amongst the Aurignacian metapopulation and the extent of their interactions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Doyon","given":"Luc"}],"citation-key":"doyon2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2018.11.009","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,1]]},"page":"99-114","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"On the shape of things: A geometric morphometrics approach to investigate Aurignacian group membership","title-short":"On the shape of things","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440318304771","volume":"101"},

It turns out that very often archaeology and the archaeological past are still almost exclusively associated with males and masculine activities. This, of course, distorts the truth about what actually happened in past societies. It also raises the questions of whether or not such biases have an influence on public participation in archaeology and if they may hinder the sector's ambition to foster inclusivity.

Amongst many methods and interpretations, modelling of ‘biased transmission’ has proved a successful strategy to tackle this problem. Here, we investigate a type of biased transmission, homophily, that is the tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others. In contrast to other social sciences, homophily remains underused in archaeology. In order to fill this gap, we develop six distinct variants of a well-established modelling framework borrowed from social science, Axelrod’s Cultural Dissemination Model. These so-called toy models are abstract models used for theory-building and aim at exploring the interplay between homophily and various factors (e.g. addition of spatial features such as mountains and coastlines, diffusion of innovations and population spread).

This experiential program uses the study of archaeological methods to address state and national social studies standards and bridges social studies content with the literacy standards of Common Core State Standards (CCSS) that aim at moving students toward twenty-first-century skill building. Students not only understand the science behind the content in their textbooks but also learn how to use museum objects and archaeological artifacts as primary resources. Students also learn to “read” artifacts, express their ideas in spoken and written language as historians, and use academic vocabulary as required by CCSS while thinking like archaeologists.

Este programa, basado en la experiencia, utiliza el estudio de los métodos arqueológicos para abordar estándares de estudios sociales estatales y nacionales, posibilitando a los estudiantes no solo a entender la ciencia que hay detrás del contenido de sus textos escolares, sino que también a aprender cómo usar los objetos expuestos en los museos y los artefactos arqueológicos como fuentes primarias. Además, el programa usa el estudio de la arqueología como puente entre los contenidos de los estudios sociales con los nuevos Common Core State Standards CCSS nacionales (Estándares Estatales Centrales Comunes), con el objetivo de crear estándares de alfabetización que promuevan en los estudiantes el desarrollo de habilidades propias del siglo 21. Los estudiantes aprenden cómo “leer” los artefactos, expresar sus ideas en lenguaje oral y escrito como historiadores y usar vocabulario académico requerido por el CCSS mientras piensan como arqueólogos. A partir de las respuestas de los profesores y las evaluaciones de los estudiantes, hemos sido capaces de saber que este programa ha sido un ejemplo exitoso de los beneficios que implica enseñar habilidades arqueológicas en el currículum educacional durante sexto año básico.

Many scholars have assumed that the abandonment of the fortified tell sites of the Great Hungarian Plain c. 1500–1450 BC led to significant regional depopulation. The authors investigate the veracity of this assumption by dating graves from Békés 103—a recently excavated Bronze Age cemetery in eastern Hungary. Using decorative motifs and radiocarbon dates to measure changing ceramic styles over more than 1300 years, they consider the implications for non-tell sites known only through surface survey. The results suggest that, even though people abandoned tell sites, regional populations were maintained.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Duffy","given":"Paul R."},{"family":"Parditka","given":"Györgyi M."},{"family":"Giblin","given":"Julia I."},{"family":"Paja","given":"László"}],"citation-key":"duffy2019","container-title":"Antiquity","DOI":"10.15184/aqy.2018.179","ISSN":"0003-598X, 1745-1744","issue":"367","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2]]},"language":"en","page":"63-79","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"The problem with tells: lessons learned from absolute dating of Bronze Age mortuary ceramics in Hungary","title-short":"The problem with tells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/problem-with-tells-lessons-learned-from-absolute-dating-of-bronze-age-mortuary-ceramics-in-hungary/6E1ABF42E0442BEADB924AD433E7F5AC","volume":"93"},

  {"id":"duguid2005","abstract":"Community of practice theory is inherently a social theory. As such it is distinct from more individualist accounts of human behavior, such as mainstream economics. Consequently, community of practice theory and economics favor different accounts of knowledge. Taking a community of practice perspective, this article challenges economists' attempts to reduce knowledge to information held by individuals and to reject tacit knowledge as mere uncodified explicit knowledge. The essay argues that Polanyi's notion of a tacit dimension affected numerous disciplines (including economics) because it addressed aspects of learning and identity that conventional social sciences overlooked. The article situates knowledge, identity, and learning within communities and points to ethical and epistemic entailments of community practice. In so doing it attempts to limit, rather than expand, the scope of community of practice analysis and to stress the difference, rather than the commonalities, between this and other apparently congenial forms of social analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Duguid","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"duguid2005","container-title":"The Information Society","DOI":"10.1080/01972240590925311","ISSN":"0197-2243","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",4,1]]},"page":"109-118","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"“The Art of Knowing”: Social and Tacit Dimensions of Knowledge and the Limits of the Community of Practice","title-short":"“The Art of Knowing”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01972240590925311","volume":"21"},

This has involved evaluating the contribution of chewing sounds to the perception of these textures or recording noises produced during mastication and evaluating various acoustic parameters from the resulting amplitude–time curves. Combining the analysis of acoustic recordings with mechanical testing results has been successful for predicting crispness and crunchiness of snack foods. The next stage for acoustic research should be to relate the structure of the products to the sounds produced during mechanical breakdown of the products in order to fully understand the textural properties of the food.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Duizer","given":"Lisa"}],"citation-key":"duizer2001","container-title":"Trends in Food Science & Technology","container-title-short":"Trends in Food Science & Technology","DOI":"10.1016/s0924-2244(01)00050-4","ISSN":"0924-2244","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"17-24","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A review of acoustic research for studying the sensory perception of crisp, crunchy and crackly textures","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224401000504","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"dunbar-hester2024","abstract":"This paper presents an account of technopolitics in Mastodon, noncommercial, decentralized social media. Mastodon’s significance has further risen in light of Twitter/X’s recent decimation of its public sphere functions; a noncommercial and ideally public alternative to commercial social media is (even more) urgently needed. The autoethnographic narrative presented here, hinging on a dispute initiated and sustained by an intemperate donkeykeeper in Europe, is idiosyncratic, to say the least. But it reveals meaningful aspects of the network’s features, which point to both the promise of such an architecture and to how it falls short in hailing other users and facilitating transparent communication, two important and related functions in democratic communication online. If we appraise Mastodon in view of civic commitments, this peculiar episode contains lessons for thinking about distribution, conviviality, and their intersections in social media. I show how Mastodon has been designed for “lossy distribution” and argue that this has implications for optimizing democratic functions of noncommercial social media.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Dunbar-Hester","given":"Christina"}],"citation-key":"dunbar-hester2024","container-title":"First Monday","DOI":"10.5210/fm.v29i3.13367","ISSN":"1396-0466","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,9]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2024 First Monday","source":"firstmonday.org","title":"Showing your ass on Mastodon: Lossy distribution, hashtag activism, and public scrutiny on federated, feral social media","title-short":"Showing your ass on Mastodon","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/13367"},

  {"id":"dunne2023","abstract":"Behaviourists treat habits as thoughtlessly undertaken actions. Pragmatists, by contrast, emphasise the role intelligence plays in habit’s cultivation. Although organisational analysts have tended to prefer behavioural approaches to habit, pragmatism has been recently resurgent. This paper analyses how David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest dramatises this hermeneutical dichotomy. The novel, we demonstrate, represents the difference between terminal decline and lasting sobriety by opposing the fates of two characters: the suffering addict (Randy Lenz) is characterised mechanistically whereas the recovering addict (Don Gately) is characterised experientially. Infinite Jest’s fictionalisation of addiction and recovery, we claim, emphasises the saving power of pragmatism. Wallace’s novel can therefore be read as another contribution towards the ongoing recovery of pragmatism both within and beyond organisation studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Dunne","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Pedersen","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"dunne2023","container-title":"Culture and Organization","DOI":"10.1080/14759551.2022.2143500","ISSN":"1475-9551","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,4]]},"page":"111-123","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Habits, Infinite Jest and the recoveries of pragmatism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14759551.2022.2143500","volume":"29"},

Archaeologists look for, and find sites (e. g., site surveys); they record sites (e. g., state surveys, the National Register of Historic Places); they collect and/or excavate sites, they interpret sites; and incredibly, they even date sites. Site usually provides the framework for recording artifact provenience; it usually serves as a sampling frame at some level in most fieldwork (e. g., Binford 1964; McManomon 1981; Redman 1973); and, largely by default, it, or some partitioning of it (e. g., Dewar 1986), serves as the unit of artifact association.

This article will briefly review the current state-of-the-art in the field of Spatial History as well as discuss a number of emerging trends such as deep mapping, digital storytelling and data visualization, utilizing examples from a variety of applications. Moreover, archaeologists can benefit from the substantial investments by the academy in the Digital Humanities, particularly in the United States and Canada.

  {"id":"eberhardt2015","abstract":"For many years now, developments in the historiography of sciences and humanities have led to the call for a revised history of archaeology and a move away from hagiography and presentations of scientific processes as an inevitable progression. Historians of archaeology have begun to utilize approved and new historiographical concepts and tools to trace how archaeological knowledge has been acquired as well as to reflect on the historical conditions and contexts in which this knowledge has been generated. This volume seeks to contribute to this trend. By linking theories and models with case studies from the nineteenth and twentieth century, the authors illuminate implications of communication on archaeological knowledge and scrutinize routines of early archaeological practices. The usefulness of different approaches such as narratological concepts or the concept of habitus is thus considered.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Eberhardt","given":"Gisela"},{"family":"Link","given":"Fabian"}],"citation-key":"eberhardt2015","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"source":"Google Scholar","title":"Historiographical Approaches to Past Archaeological Research","type":"book","URL":"https://www.unine.ch/files/live/sites/ia/files/Membres%20institut/G%C3%A9raldine/The%20long%20revolution.pdf"},

That is the question posed by this book, challenging conventional ideas about the relationship between the subject and the object, the observer and the observed, and the explainers and the explained. This book explores the production of archaeological knowledge from a range of ethnographic perspectives. Fieldwork spans large parts of the world, with sites in Turkey, the Netherlands, Mexico, Brazil, Italy, Germany, the USA and the United Kingdom being covered. They focus on excavation, inscription, heritage management, student training, the employment of hired workers and many other aspects of archaeological practice. These experimental ethnographic studies are situated right on the interface of archaeology and anthropology_on the road to a more holistic study of the present and the past.","author":[{"family":"Edgeworth","given":"Matt"}],"citation-key":"edgeworth2006","event-place":"Lanham, MD","ISBN":"978-0-7591-0845-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"222","publisher":"Rowman Altamira","publisher-place":"Lanham, MD","source":"Google Books","title":"Ethnographies of Archaeological Practice: Cultural Encounters, Material Transformations","title-short":"Ethnographies of Archaeological Practice","type":"book"},

  {"id":"edmond2005","abstract":"Although there has been an increased uptake of technology-based outputs and methods in humanities research, substantial barriers remain to the full realization of potential benefits in this area. Some of these barriers resonate with the most basic challenges defined by the field of Human–Computer Interaction, including the move from computational to faciliatory computing, non-user-centred industrial design of research tools, the application of inappropriate experience models by users, and a cultural mismatch between researchers and technicians. This article develops a model of digital development in the humanities as a ‘value chain’, along which critical gaps appear when the only actors in the chain are the researcher and the technical support staff. Having identified these gaps, the article then goes on to suggest ways in which a dedicated Digital Humanities Intermediary (DHI) is able to provide much needed skills and support of a non-specifically technical nature at critical moments in the projects' development. This kind of intermediary can be instrumental in increasing technology use among humanities research staff, providing a wide range of technical knowledge and other support functions to the relevant faculties in a form that fits well with their own language and preferred ways of working. The success of the position is dependant on solid networks and the enlightened support of the University, however, as it is still very much at the stage of reacting and capitalizing on opportunities as they are encountered, rather than simply slotting in to a stable, static, proven structure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Edmond","given":"Jennifer"}],"citation-key":"edmond2005","container-title":"Literary and Linguistic Computing","container-title-short":"Literary and Linguistic Computing","DOI":"10.1093/llc/fqi036","ISSN":"0268-1145","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",9,1]]},"page":"367-380","source":"Silverchair","title":"The Role of the Professional Intermediary in Expanding the Humanities Computing Base","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqi036","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"edmond2015b","abstract":"As part of the Europeana Cloud (eCloud) project, Trinity College Dublin investigated best practice in the use of web services, such as APIs, for accessing large data sets from cultural heritage collections. This research looked into the provision and use of APIs, and moreover, whether or not more customised programmatic access to datasets is what researchers want or need. In order to understand whether current patterns of API usage reflect a skills gap on the part of researchers or a mismatch of tool to purpose, we looked not only at the creators and developer/users of APIs, but also at humanists already re-using big data; approaches in cultural heritage institutions and other research infrastructures to bring API use to non-technical audiences; and the kinds of training and other support services available or emerging within the data-intensive humanities research lifecycle. We conducted both desk research and a series of 11 interviews with figures working as researchers, developers or data providers, including figures from both the API development and the data usage communities. This research, conducted under the eCloud project and supported by the European Commission’s ICT Policy and Support Programme (Grant number 325091), was begun in March 2014 and is now in its concluding validation stage. The results of the research are not yet finalised, but the contribution is already emerging of this work to the debate about APIs being either the way forward for digital cultural heritage collections, or the Emperor’s New Clothes (or maybe a bit of both).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Edmond","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Garnett","given":"Vicky"}],"citation-key":"edmond2015b","container-title":"International Journal of Digital Curation","DOI":"10.2218/ijdc.v10i1.369","ISSN":"1746-8256","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",2,18]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c)","number":"1","page":"287-297","source":"www.ijdc.net","title":"APIs and Researchers: The Emperor's New Clothes?","title-short":"APIs and Researchers","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/view/10.1.287","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"edwards2011","abstract":"When scientists from two or more disciplines work together on related problems, they often face what we call ‘science friction’. As science becomes more data-driven, collaborative, and interdisciplinary, demand increases for interoperability among data, tools, and services. Metadata – usually viewed simply as ‘data about data’, describing objects such as books, journal articles, or datasets – serve key roles in interoperability. Yet we find that metadata may be a source of friction between scientific collaborators, impeding data sharing. We propose an alternative view of metadata, focusing on its role in an ephemeral process of scientific communication, rather than as an enduring outcome or product. We report examples of highly useful, yet ad hoc, incomplete, loosely structured, and mutable, descriptions of data found in our ethnographic studies of several large projects in the environmental sciences. Based on this evidence, we argue that while metadata products can be powerful resources, usually they must be supplemented with metadata processes. Metadata-as-process suggests the very large role of the ad hoc, the incomplete, and the unfinished in everyday scientific work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Edwards","given":"Paul N."},{"family":"Mayernik","given":"Matthew S."},{"family":"Batcheller","given":"Archer L."},{"family":"Bowker","given":"Geoffrey C."},{"family":"Borgman","given":"Christine L."}],"citation-key":"edwards2011","container-title":"Social Studies of Science","container-title-short":"Soc Stud Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0306312711413314","ISSN":"0306-3127","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",10,1]]},"language":"english","page":"667–690","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","title":"Science friction: Data, metadata, and collaboration","title-short":"Science friction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0306312711413314","volume":"41"},

Landmark projects over the past century introduced various classification systems and initiated important debates within the field. From the author’s perspective, classification of data is understood as a necessary precursor to computation in these projects. Classificatory thinking is used here as a theme to explore debates that have arisen when abstractions of musical practice have been suggested for use with ethnomusicology. The paper proposes that a recent approach to research practice for embedding computation adds to ongoing interdisciplinary work, demonstrating novel ways of contextualizing archival materials with ethnography alongside computation. The approach attempted to strike a balance for engaging large amounts of data in ethnomusicology. The paper argues that some resulting tensions arising from classification lead to insights, which cannot be drawn by ethnomusicological methods alone.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Egan (Pádraig Mac Aodhgáin)","given":"Patrick"}],"citation-key":"eganpadraigmacaodhgain2021","container-title":"Interdisciplinary Science Reviews","DOI":"10.1080/03080188.2021.1872144","ISSN":"0308-0188","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,2]]},"page":"477-500","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Insider or outsider?

Several Nordic, European, and other multinational collaborations are now well established. Advantages of big data for clinical epidemiology include improved precision of estimates, which is especially important for reassuring (“null”) findings; ability to conduct meaningful analyses in subgroup of patients; and rapid detection of safety signals. Big data will also provide new possibilities for research by enabling access to linked information from biobanks, electronic medical records, patient-reported outcome measures, automatic and semiautomatic electronic monitoring devices, and social media. The sheer amount of data, however, does not eliminate and may even amplify systematic error.

  {"id":"eifling2021","abstract":"Any field team, regardless of the professionalism of the leadership, will eventually experience a critical event. Some events will result in a subtle degradation of the team's work; others will cause emergent threats to the safety of the team. A team's sustained performance during a field season depends partly on such chance events and partly with the team's ability to plan for and respond to the dynamic environment of the field. The duty of a field leader is to conduct clear-eyed conversations and ensure that solid preparations are laid for both the group as a whole and the individual team members. Some of these plans need to be manifested by material preparations, some of which require months of forethought. This article walks readers through a two-hour exercise, giving them frameworks from business continuity and military field doctrines to understand risk. Readers will conduct a SWOT analysis, define emergencies within their organizations, and then apply risk management practices of qualitative risk assessment and all-hazards planning to develop planning priorities. By the end, readers will have built specific action plans for improving field season readiness.\n, \nCualquier equipo de campo, independientemente del profesionalismo de su liderazgo, eventualmente experimentará un evento crítico. Algunos de estos eventos resultarán en la degradación del trabajo del equipo; otros provocarán nuevas amenazas para su seguridad. El desempeño sostenido de un equipo durante la temporada de campo, depende por un lado de tales eventos fortuitos y en parte, de la capacidad del equipo para planificar y responder al entorno dinámico del campo. El deber de un líder de campo es mantener conversaciones claras y asegurarse de que se lleve a cabo una preparación sólida, tanto para el grupo en su conjunto, como para cada miembro del equipo. Algunos de estos planes requieren de la preparación de materiales y meses de planificación. Este artículo guía a los lectores a través de un ejercicio de dos horas, brindándoles un marco estructural sobre doctrinas de continuidad de negocios y el ámbito militar para entender riesgos. Los lectores realizarán un análisis FODA y definirán emergencias dentro de sus organizaciones, para luego aplicar prácticas de gestión de riesgos en la evaluación de riesgos cualitativos y el planeamiento de todo peligro, a fin de establecer prioridades en la planificación.

  {"id":"eifling2021a","abstract":"Due to the intellectual, physical, and emotional demands of field research, those doing this work need to strategies to monitor and maintain their own mental health before, during, and after a field season. Moreover, they should have a framework for supporting their colleagues. This review article will present a framework for assessing the mental health hazards and the reactions, both positive and negative, to fieldwork. First, it will use U.S. epidemiology to show that most field teams are at risk. Second, it will frame the field season both as a workplace and wilderness exposure event and discuss the elements of the field research environment that can be therapeutic for some but toxic for others. Third, it will discuss the psychological impacts of travel and reintegration as they are pertinent to the practice of archaeology. Research will be presented in order to guide evidence-informed policies for the field research team to improve the mental-health readiness and resiliency of the research team. Last, it will provide guidance on how to manage the anxiety caused by separating from social media platforms.\n, \nDebido a las demandas intelectuales, físicas y emocionales de la investigación de campo, quienes realizan este trabajo necesitan estrategias para monitorear y mantener su salud mental antes, durante y después de una temporada de campo. Además, tendrían también que contar con una estructura de apoyo para sus colegas. Este artículo presenta un esquema para evaluar los peligros para la salud mental y sus consecuencias, tanto positivas como negativas, para el trabajo de campo. Primero, se tomará como modelo la epidemiología en los Estados Unidos, para mostrar que la mayoría de los equipos de campo se encuentran en riesgo. Segundo, se enmarcará la temporada de campo como lugar de trabajo y como situación de contacto directo con la naturaleza, y se discutirán los elementos del entorno de investigación de campo que pueden ser terapéuticos para algunos, pero tóxicos para otros. En tercer lugar, se discutirá el impacto psicológico de los viajes y la reintegración, pues son pertinentes para la práctica de la arqueología. La investigación se presentará con el objetivo de orientar las políticas basadas en evidencias, a fin de que el equipo de investigación de campo mejore la preparación de su salud mental y su capacidad de recuperación. Por último, se brindará orientación sobre cómo manejar la ansiedad provocada por el distanciamiento de las plataformas de redes sociales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Eifling","given":"Kurt P."}],"citation-key":"eifling2021a","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2020.51","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2]]},"language":"en","page":"10-22","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Mental Health and the Field Research Team","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/abs/mental-health-and-the-field-research-team/73ABCE469AD96585D37F4D3AF0CC40EE","volume":"9"},

The authors suggest that such organizational understandings of bureaucratic processes can more meaningfully inform their redesign and contribute to developing more appropriately scaled ethics governance.

  {"id":"ellick2016a","abstract":"To know where we are going, we need to know where we have been, so it seems only fitting that, to produce a special issue on designing and assessing public education programs in archaeology, we need to look back to the establishment of public outreach and archaeological education in the United States and, specifically, within the Society for American Archaeology. Archaeological education, as a subfield of archaeology, can trace its roots to individual efforts at sharing archaeology with the public, but especially to the first Save the Past for the Future Conference in Taos, New Mexico. It was here that the idea took root that, to stem vandalism and looting, we need to educate people about archaeology. This meeting was the springboard for federal initiatives like Project Archaeology and Passport in Time, and it was also the birthplace for the SAA Public Education Committee. For more than 25 years, archaeologists have been creating public outreach programs, students have graduated college thinking of public outreach as a career path, and TV shows have sensationalized our profession, but what do we really know about what we’ve done, whether we’ve made a difference, and how it can propel ourselves and future generations of archaeological educators forward?\n, \nResumen\nPara saber a dónde vamos, hace falta saber dónde hemos estado; por tanto, para producir una edición especial acerca del diseño y evaluación de programas educativos públicos en arqueología, necesitamos realizar una retrospectiva hacia el establecimiento de actividades de divulgación y educación arqueológica en los Estados Unidos, y más específicamente dentro de la “Society for American Archaeology” (Sociedad para la Arqueología Americana). La educación arqueológica, como sub-campo de la arqueología, puede trazar sus raíces hacia los esfuerzos individuales que compartieron esta ciencia con el público, pero más específicamente, con la primera conferencia “Save the Past for the Future” (Salva el Pasado para el Futuro), llevada a cabo en Taos, Nuevo México. Fue aquí donde se introdujo formalmente la idea que, para enfrentar el vandalismo y saqueo, necesitamos educar a las personas sobre la arqueología. Esta reunión fue el trampolín para iniciativas federales como el “Project Archaeology” and “Passport in Time” (Proyecto Arqueología y Pasaporte en el Tiempo), y también el lugar de nacimiento del “SAA Public Education Committee” (Comité de Educación Pública de la SAA). Por más de 25 años los arqueólogos han creado programas de divulgación pública, los estudiantes se han graduado de la universidad pensando en la difusión pública como una carrera, y los programas de televisión han hecho sensacionalismo sobre nuestra profesión, pero ¿qué sabemos realmente sobre lo que hemos realizado?, ¿hemos hecho una diferencia?, y ¿en qué forma nosotros y las futuras generaciones de especialistas en arqueología educativa nos podemos impulsar hacia adelante?","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Ellick","given":"Carol J."}],"citation-key":"ellick2016a","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.7183/2326-3768.4.4.425","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11]]},"language":"en","page":"425-440","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"A Cultural History of Archaeological Education","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/cultural-history-of-archaeological-education/8B41E7928A07A24156D7FEEAEC15C4DF","volume":"4"},

The information seeking patterns were derived from interviews with physicists at Manchester University and chemists at the University of Sheffield. The methodology adopted for the interviews and analysis was qualitative and based on the grounded theory approach. The results were then compared with the findings of the previous study of the social scientists to try and identify similarities and differences between the two groups. Certain minor variations concerned with awareness levels of facilities, the extent of usage of a source and the research stage at which a strategy may be employed were identified.

  {"id":"emerson2019","abstract":"Managing collections means ensuring that the data about them are useful, available, and accurate. In addition to the technical aspects of data management, there are layers of political and social structure that direct the construction and use of collections data. The Minnesota Historical Society (MNHS) employs a set of data standards that allows us to gather electronic cataloging data from a wide community of archaeology researchers who are depositing collections at our institution. Though met with initial resistance, these standards have facilitated publication in Open Context as linked open data. Furthermore, institutional discussions concerning Creative Commons licensing and the cultural sensitivity of collections data were precipitated by publication, highlighting the role of social agreement in data management. We found that successful employment of data standards must take into account the needs of the various stakeholders and further their interests. Standards will be most useful and successful when they are lightweight, are supported by training and documentation, and exist as part of a system that allows for more than one way to characterize the collections., Administrar colecciones significa garantizar que los datos acerca de estas sean útiles y precisos, y estén disponibles. Además de los aspectos técnicos del manejo de datos, hay capas de estructura política y social que dirigen la construcción y el uso de los datos de las colecciones. La Sociedad Histórica de Minnesota emplea un conjunto de estándares de datos que permite recopilar datos de catalogación electrónica de una amplia comunidad de investigadores de arqueología que depositan colecciones en nuestra institución. Aunque se encontraron con una resistencia inicial, estos estándares han facilitado la publicación en Open Context como datos abiertos conectados. Además, las discusiones institucionales sobre la licencia de Creative Commons, y la susceptibilidad cultural de los datos de colecciones, se precipitaron mediante la publicación, destacando el rol del acuerdo social en el manejo de datos. Establecer los requisitos técnicos fue un reto. Encontrar una forma de representar los datos existentes con precisión, de manera útil y fácil de buscar, ha sido igualmente desafiante. Los estándares serán más útiles y exitosos cuando sean ligeros, estén respaldados por la formación y la documentación, y existan como parte de un sistema que permite más de una manera de caracterizar las colecciones.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Emerson","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Nancy"}],"citation-key":"emerson2019","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2019.19","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8]]},"language":"en","page":"258-266","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Technical, Political, and Social Issues in Archaeological Collections Data Management","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/technical-political-and-social-issues-in-archaeological-collections-data-management/7974306C6E3EAF64D26116BC155CCCE4","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"emerson2021","abstract":"Archaeology field schools provide unique opportunities for firsthand exposure, team-based learning, and pre-professional experience. A participant's decision to pursue a career in archaeology may reflect initial fieldwork group experiences and individual interactions with field school leaders and staff. Today, safety, security, and equity policies along with staff and operational procedures that support them are essential for instructing and inspiring all who wish to experience archaeological fieldwork. Drawing on three decades of field school participation and administration, the author describes specific examples of fieldwork learning contexts as well as insights into operating a safe, secure, and welcoming field school.

  {"id":"emery2018","abstract":"Rome initiated several campaigns to expand, conquer, and enslave local Italic populations following the establishment of the republic in 504 BCE. However, the cultural and biological changes resulting from Roman subjugation across Italy remain a topic of intense historical debate. Although important, historic and archaeological lines of evidence fail to track the impact of forced enslavement and enculturation at individual and broader genetic scales and, more generally, offer fewer clues regarding the potential affinities of Roman period Italians to European, Near Eastern, western Asian and North African populations at this time. In this paper, we present the whole mitochondrial (mtDNA) genomes of 30 Roman period (1st–4th centuries CE) individuals buried in the Vagnari necropolis in southern Italy. We integrate the mtDNA data with previously published bioarchaeological and isotope (δ18O and 87Sr/86Sr) data for the Vagnari assemblage and compare Roman haplogroup composition to 15 newly sequenced mitochondrial genomes obtained from a pre-Roman Iron Age skeletal assemblage, located in close proximity to Vagnari. Additionally, we contrast our South Italian dataset with a further 332 complete ancient mtDNA genomes from the pan-Mediterranean region, Europe, western Asia and North African regions. Population pairwise ΦST values suggest that Roman Italians share closer genetic similarity to Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Armenian Iron Age populations from western and central Eurasia than with Iron Age Italians, Ptolemaic, and Roman period Egyptians. Vagnari individuals with δ18O, 87Sr/86Sr, and mtDNA data suggest a predominantly local demographic was employed at the site. However, two individuals belong to eastern Eurasian haplogroup D4b1c, indicating that the maternal ancestors of these two individuals migrated to South Italy prior to the 1st century CE. Additionally, we provide the first genetic evidence for possible maternal relatedness in a Roman period skeletal assemblage. Our research highlights the significance of integrating multiple lines of bioarchaeological data to inform interpretations about Roman colonial expansion and its impact on population structure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Emery","given":"Matthew V."},{"family":"Duggan","given":"Ana T."},{"family":"Murchie","given":"Tyler J."},{"family":"Stark","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"Klunk","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Hider","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Eaton","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Karpinski","given":"Emil"},{"family":"Schwarcz","given":"Henry P."},{"family":"Poinar","given":"Hendrik N."},{"family":"Prowse","given":"Tracy L."}],"citation-key":"emery2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2018.04.036","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,1]]},"page":"200-209","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Ancient Roman mitochondrial genomes and isotopes reveal relationships and geographic origins at the local and pan-Mediterranean scales","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X17308568","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"emmitt2017","abstract":"The excavation of the site of Kom W in the Fayum region of Egypt during the 1920s by Caton-Thompson and Gardner resulted in the loss of the original surface topography. Detailed section drawings recorded the surface and bottom of excavation, but it was previously difficult to interpret the published images. This article reports on the use of these images to create a three-dimensional representation of the site as it was before and after excavation in the 1920s. This visualization aids the interpretation of the formation processes that shaped Kom W in ways that were previously unachievable due to limitations in the original data. Archaeological sites are under increasing threat of destruction, especially in the Near East.

  {"id":"emmitt2019","abstract":"The site of Roonka, South Australia, is the largest excavation of an Aboriginal burial ground in Australia. Excavated in the 1960s-70s, the site has never been fully analysed, partly because of the difficulties of interpreting the complex of lburials and other features that had accumulated over at least 7000 years. Here we use a combination of geographical information systems (GIS) and computer aided design programs (CAD) to create a 3D representation of the main excavation, trench A, at Roonka. Questions regarding the depositional history of the site are examined, with the reconstruction suggesting multiple occupation of the area and potential differentiations in the use of space. The results show the utility of the 3D reconstruction of archaeological sites from paper excavation records and the potential for further interpretations from such data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Emmitt","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Littleton","given":"Judith"},{"family":"Young","given":"Rose"},{"family":"Phillipps","given":"Rebecca"}],"citation-key":"emmitt2019","container-title":"Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage","container-title-short":"Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage","DOI":"10.1016/j.daach.2019.e00094","ISSN":"2212-0548","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,25]]},"page":"e00094","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Digitizing Roonka: The creation of a 3D representation from archival records","title-short":"Digitizing Roonka","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212054818300286"},

  {"id":"engestrom2000","abstract":"Cultural-historical activity theory is a new framework aimed at transcending the dichotomies of micro- and macro-, mental and material, observation and intervention in analysis and redesign of work. The approach distinguishes between short-lived goal-directed actions and durable, object-oriented activity systems. A historically evolving collective activity system, seen in its network relations to other activity systems, is taken as the prime unit of analysis against which scripted strings of goal-directed actions and automatic operations are interpreted. Activity systems are driven by communal motives that are often difficult to articulate for individual participants. Activity systems are in constant movement and internally contradictory. Their systemic contradictions, manifested in disturbances and mundane innovations, offer possibilities for expansive developmental transformations. Such transformations proceed through stepwise cycles of expansive learning which begin with actions of questioning the existing standard practice, then proceed to actions of analyzing its contradictions and modelling a vision for its zone of proximal development, then to actions of examining and implementing the new model in practice. New forms of work organization increasingly require negotiated 'knotworking' across boundaries. Correspondingly, expansive learning increasingly involves horizontal widening of collective expertise by means of debating, negotiating and hybridizing different perspectives and conceptualizations. Findings from a longitudinal intervention study of children's medical care illuminate the theoretical arguments.","author":[{"family":"Engeström","given":"Y."}],"citation-key":"engestrom2000","container-title":"Ergonomics","container-title-short":"Ergonomics","DOI":"10.1080/001401300409143","ISSN":"0014-0139","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",7]]},"language":"eng","page":"960-974","PMID":"10929830","source":"PubMed","title":"Activity theory as a framework for analyzing and redesigning work","type":"article-journal","volume":"43"},

  {"id":"eren2016","abstract":"Recent studies have indicated that Levallois-style core reduction offered potential practical benefits to hominin populations. However, none of these studies have yet considered one of the most important functional attributes of flake tools, which is edge angle. To address this shortcoming, we statistically examined flakes produced experimentally during “classic” or “lineal” Levallois core production and reduction. The primary aim of our analyses was to statistically test the null hypothesis of “no difference” between the edge angles of “Levallois” products and the flakes involved in their production. We employ existing edge angle analytical techniques and develop new comparative methodologies to assess flake blank standardization through the case of Levallois core reduction. Having determined the statistical properties of our experimental Levallois reductions, we thereafter evaluated to what extent edge angles produced may, or may not, have been useful to prehistoric hominins. Our analyses demonstrated that the experimentally produced Levallois edge angles were indeed statistically different from the flakes involved in their production. These differences were evident both in terms of relatively higher (i.e., more obtuse) edge angles than debitage flakes and in being significantly less variable around their higher mean edge angles compared to debitage flakes. However, based on current knowledge of how flake edge angle properties relate to issues of functionality, such differences would not have been detrimental to their functionality. Indeed, the edge angle properties they possess would have provided distinct benefits to hominins engaged in their manufacture. Most notably, Levallois-style core organization and reduction would have provided hominins with a reliable means of consistently producing flakes (i.e., “Levallois flakes”) possessing average flake angles that are beneficial in terms of providing a viable cutting edge yet not being so acute as to be friable upon application. Hence, edge angle properties join an array of other features that provide logical motive for why hominins may have organized core production and reduction around Levallois-style patterns at various times and places during the Mid-Late Pleistocene.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Eren","given":"Metin I."},{"family":"Lycett","given":"Stephen J."}],"citation-key":"eren2016","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-015-9245-z","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"379-398","source":"link-springer-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca","title":"A Statistical Examination of Flake Edge Angles Produced During Experimental Lineal Levallois Reductions and Consideration of Their Functional Implications","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-015-9245-z","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"escamilla2022","abstract":"The definition of scholarly content has expanded to include the data and source code that contribute to a publication. While major archiving efforts to preserve conventional scholarly content, typically in PDFs (e.g., LOCKSS, CLOCKSS, Portico), are underway, no analogous effort has yet emerged to preserve the data and code referenced in those PDFs, particularly the scholarly code hosted online on Git Hosting Platforms (GHPs). Similarly, the Software Heritage Foundation is working to archive public source code, but there is value in archiving the issue threads, pull requests, and wikis that provide important context to the code while maintaining their original URLs. In current implementations, source code and its ephemera are not preserved, which presents a problem for scholarly projects where reproducibility matters. To understand and quantify the scope of this issue, we analyzed the use of GHP URIs in the arXiv and PMC corpora from January 2007 to December 2021. In total, there were 253,590 URIs to GitHub, SourceForge, Bitbucket, and GitLab repositories across the 2.66 million publications in the corpora. We found that GitHub, GitLab, SourceForge, and Bitbucket were collectively linked to 160 times in 2007 and 76,746 times in 2021. In 2021, one out of five publications in the arXiv corpus included a URI to GitHub. The complexity of GHPs like GitHub is not amenable to conventional Web archiving techniques. Therefore, the growing use of GHPs in scholarly publications points to an urgent and growing need for dedicated efforts to archive their holdings in order to preserve research code and its scholarly ephemera.","author":[{"family":"Escamilla","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Klein","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Cooper","given":"Talya"},{"family":"Rampin","given":"Vicky"},{"family":"Weigle","given":"Michele C."},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Michael L."}],"citation-key":"escamilla2022","collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","container-title":"Linking Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-031-16802-4_15","editor":[{"family":"Silvello","given":"Gianmaria"},{"family":"Corcho","given":"Oscar"},{"family":"Manghi","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Di Nunzio","given":"Giorgio Maria"},{"family":"Golub","given":"Koraljka"},{"family":"Ferro","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Poggi","given":"Antonella"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-031-16802-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","page":"187-200","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"The Rise of GitHub in Scholarly Publications","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"escamilla2023","abstract":"Paper publications are no longer the only form of research product. Due to recent initiatives by publication venues and funding institutions, open access datasets and software products are increasingly considered research products and URIs to these products are growing more prevalent in scholarly publications. However, as with all URIs, resources found on the live Web are not permanent. Archivists and institutions including Software Heritage, Internet Archive, and Zenodo are working to preserve data and software products as valuable parts of reproducibility, a cornerstone of scientific research. While some hosting platforms are well-known and can be identified with regular expressions, there are a vast number of smaller, more niche hosting platforms utilized by researchers to host their data and software. If it is not feasible to manually identify all hosting platforms used by researchers, how can we identify URIs to open-access data and software (OADS) to aid in their preservation? We used a hybrid classifier to classify URIs as OADS URIs and non-OADS URIs. We found that URIs to Git hosting platforms (GHPs) including GitHub, GitLab, SourceForge, and Bitbucket accounted for 33% of OADS URIs. Non-GHP OADS URIs are distributed across almost 50,000 unique hostnames. We determined that using a hybrid classifier allows for the identification of OADS URIs in less common hosting platforms which can benefit discoverability for preserving datasets and software products as research products for reproducibility.","author":[{"family":"Escamilla","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Salsabil","given":"Lamia"},{"family":"Klein","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Weigle","given":"Michele C."},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Michael L."}],"citation-key":"escamilla2023","collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","container-title":"Linking Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-031-43849-3_17","editor":[{"family":"Alonso","given":"Omar"},{"family":"Cousijn","given":"Helena"},{"family":"Silvello","given":"Gianmaria"},{"family":"Marrero","given":"Mónica"},{"family":"Teixeira Lopes","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Marchesin","given":"Stefano"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-031-43849-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"195-206","publisher":"Springer Nature Switzerland","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"It’s Not Just GitHub: Identifying Data and Software Sources Included in Publications","title-short":"It’s Not Just GitHub","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"esteva2011","abstract":"As collections become larger in size, more complex in structure and increasingly diverse in composition, new approaches are needed to help curators assess digital files and make decisions about their long-term preservation. We present research on the use of interactive visualization to analyze file characterization information for the purpose of assessing the preservation condition of a vast collection of complex electronic records. The case study collection contains over 1,000,000 files of diverse formats arranged in varied record structures and record groups. The visualization application uses tree maps and a relational database management system (RDBMS) to represent the collection's arrangement and to show available characterization information at different levels of aggregation, classification and abstraction. Through this visualization interface curators can interact dynamically with the collections' characterization information to discover trends, as well as compare and contrast various file characteristics across the collection. Curators may select and weight the variables that they want to analyze. They can pursue analysis workflows that go from a high-level overview of the collection's preservation condition based on file format risks, to obtaining more detailed results about the condition of record groups and individual records. While there are various digital preservation planning tools available, to our knowledge none have been designed specifically to visually present assessment information across vast and complex collections. We present research to address the need for such a tool.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Esteva","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Weijia"},{"family":"Jain","given":"Suyog Dutt"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jennifer L."},{"family":"Martin","given":"Wendy K."}],"citation-key":"esteva2011","container-title":"International Journal of Digital Curation","DOI":"10.2218/ijdc.v6i1.171","ISSN":"1746-8256","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",3,8]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c)","page":"45-57","source":"www.ijdc.net","title":"Assessing the Preservation Condition of Large and Heterogeneous Electronic Records Collections with Visualization","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/view/162","volume":"6"},

Owing to increasing interest and activity in the field, a substantial amount of archaeological isotope baseline data exist for Northern Europe, consisting mainly of animal bone collagen δ13C, δ15N, and δ34S values. However, the data are scattered into dozens of publications written in multiple languages and less-accessible formats, making the data laborious to use. This article presents the first compilation work of this data, the open access dIANA database (Dietary Isotopic baseline for the Ancient North; https://www.oasisnorth.org/diana.html), aimed to support (paleo)dietary research in the Baltic Sea area. The database work is complemented with new analyses of archaeological and (pre-)modern domestic and wild fauna from Finland and Russia broadening the selection of analysed species in the database. We present and discuss data examples, which on one hand show existing spatiotemporal isotope patterns related to diet and differences in the environmental carbon sources and on the other, also visualize the current status of baseline research and the need for further analyses in the circum-Baltic area.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Etu-Sihvola","given":"H."},{"family":"Bocherens","given":"H."},{"family":"Drucker","given":"D.

  {"id":"evans2015","abstract":"This article takes a fresh view of unpublished archaeological reports, common in archaeological practice in England since the advent of PPG16. Although these reports are almost ubiquitously referred to as 'grey literature', they are but a facet of a larger corpus of publication and dissemination techniques used by the archaeological community. It is argued that the term 'grey' has become synonymous with a liminal status and inferior quality that is in fact contrary to the realities of the increased online publication of fieldwork reports. The article also considers the current upsurge in research projects and academic theses using fieldwork reports, and highlights the necessity that findings from research are fed back into the curatorial sector and baseline data to inform all aspects of archaeological work rather than isolated in published literature often unavailable to those outside of academia. Finally, the article argues that although the challenge of increased access – via the web – is being met, this is not consistent across the country, leading to lacunae in the information landscape. Furthermore, as the number of online reports grows into the tens of thousands there is a need for greater sophistication and archaeological context in the accompanying metadata, to aid classification and reuse.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Evans","given":"Tim"}],"citation-key":"evans2015","container-title":"Internet Archaeology","container-title-short":"IA","DOI":"10.11141/ia.40.6","ISSN":"1363-5387","issue":"40","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,22]]},"language":"en","source":"intarch.ac.uk","title":"A Reassessment of Archaeological Grey Literature: semantics and paradoxes","title-short":"A Reassessment of Archaeological Grey Literature","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue40/6/index.html"},

  {"id":"fabrega-alvarez2019","abstract":"Visibility analysis has become extremely popular in landscape-oriented archaeology in recent decades and has become even more widespread with the popularization of GIS tools, which have multiplied the ways in which visual perception can be analysed and digitally modelled. Visibility has been used as a proxy for different archaeological approaches, from the analysis of subjective perception to the assessment of strategic control. While interest has most often been focused on how objects, features and sites are perceived, there has also been an interest in how visual control is exerted from archaeological sites or other places in the landscape. Within the latter approaches, the distances at which visual control can be exercised have usually been determined in a more or less arbitrary manner, without a clear and empirically informed reference on how things and, especially, people can be observed and recognized differently at a distance. In this paper, we present the results of a field experiment carried out to measure the distances at which individuals can be spotted, recognized and identified with the naked eye in favourable conditions. Based on these results, we introduce the concept of Individual Distance Viewshed (IDV) as a GIS-based representation of visual control. This will serve as a reference to better qualify potential visibility in landscape analysis. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of this approach with a case study which explores the relationship between visual control and mobility during the Iron Age in the NW of the Iberian Peninsula.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Fábrega-Álvarez","given":"Pastor"},{"family":"Parcero-Oubiña","given":"César"}],"citation-key":"fabrega-alvarez2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2019.02.002","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"page":"56-74","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Now you see me.

  {"id":"faniel2011","abstract":"There is almost universal agreement that scientific data should be shared for use beyond the purposes for which they were initially collected. Access to data enables system-level science, expands the instruments and products of research to new communities, and advances solutions to complex human problems. While demands for data are not new, the vision of open access to data is increasingly ambitious. The aim is to make data accessible and usable to anyone, anytime, anywhere, and for any purpose. Until recently, scholarly investigations related to data sharing and reuse were sparse. They have become more common as technology and instrumentation have advanced, policies that mandate sharing have been implemented, and research has become more interdisciplinary. Each of these factors has contributed to what is commonly referred to as the \"data deluge\". Most discussions about increases in the scale of sharing and reuse have focused on growing amounts of data. There are other issues related to open access to data that also concern scale which have not been as widely discussed: broader participation in data sharing and reuse, increases in the number and types of intermediaries, and more digital data products. The purpose of this paper is to develop a research agenda for scientific data sharing and reuse that considers these three areas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Faniel","given":"Ixchel M."},{"family":"Zimmerman","given":"Ann"}],"citation-key":"faniel2011","container-title":"International Journal of Digital Curation","container-title-short":"IJDC","DOI":"10.2218/ijdc.v6i1.172","ISSN":"1746-8256","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",3,8]]},"page":"58-69","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Beyond the Data Deluge: A Research Agenda for Large-Scale Data Sharing and Reuse","title-short":"Beyond the Data Deluge","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/163","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"faniel2012","abstract":"We know little about the data reuse practices of novice data users. Yet large scale data reuse over the long term depends in part on uptake from early career researchers. This paper examines 22 novice social science researchers and how they make sense of social science data. Novices are particularly interested in understanding how data: 1) are transformed from qualitative to quantitative data, 2) capture concepts not well-established in the literature, and 3) can be matched and merged across multiple datasets. We discuss how novice data users make sense of data in these three circumstances. We find that novices seek to understand the data producer's rationale for methodological procedures and measurement choices, which is broadly similar to researchers in other scientific communities. However we also find that they not only reflect on whether they can trust the data producers' decisions, but also seek guidance from members of their disciplinary community. Specifically, novice social science researchers are heavily influenced by more experienced social science researchers when it comes to discovering, evaluating, and justifying their reuse of other's data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Faniel","given":"Ixchel M."},{"family":"Kriesberg","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Yakel","given":"Elizabeth"}],"citation-key":"faniel2012","container-title":"Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"faniel2013","abstract":"Field archaeology only recently developed centralized systems for data curation, management, and reuse. Data documentation guidelines, standards, and ontologies have yet to see wide adoption in this discipline. Moreover, repository practices have focused on supporting data collection, deposit, discovery, and access more than data reuse. In this paper we examine the needs of archaeological data reusers, particularly the context they need to understand, verify, and trust data others collect during field studies. We then apply our findings to the existing work on standards development. We find that archaeologists place the most importance on data collection procedures, but the reputation and scholarly affiliation of the archaeologists who conducted the original field studies, the wording and structure of the documentation created during field work, and the repository where the data are housed also inform reuse. While guidelines, standards, and ontologies address some aspects of the context data reusers need, they provide less guidance on others, especially those related to research design. We argue repositories need to address these missing dimensions of context to better support data reuse in archaeology.","author":[{"family":"Faniel","given":"Ixchel"},{"family":"Kansa","given":"Eric C."},{"family":"Whitcher Kansa","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Barrera-Gomez","given":"Julianna"},{"family":"Yakel","given":"Elizabeth"}],"citation-key":"faniel2013","container-title":"Proceedings of the 13th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries","DOI":"10.1145/2467696.2467712","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-4503-2077-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"295–304","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"New York","title":"The Challenges of Digging Data: A Study of Context in Archaeological Data Reuse","title-short":"The Challenges of Digging Data","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"faniel2018","abstract":"This article presents research on archaeological data creation and management practices at two excavations in Europe in order to gain a better understanding of how to align these practices with the data reuse needs of a broader research community. The Secret Life of Data project follows the life cycle of data from the field to the digital repository to better understand opportunities and challenges in data interpretation, publication, and preservation. Our “Slow Data” approach focuses not on maximizing the speed and quantity of data but, rather, on emphasizing curation, contextualization, communication, and broader understanding. Through a mixed-methods approach of interviews, field observations, and excavation data assessments, we recommended changes (both technical and organizational) to improve data creation and management practices. We report our findings and offer readers guidance on streamlining data collection for reuse during excavation., Este artículo presenta los resultados de una investigación sobre la creación y gestión de datos arqueológicos en dos excavaciones en Europa con el objetivo de mejor entender cómo alinear esas prácticas con las necesidades de reutilización de datos de una comunidad de investigadores más amplia. El proyecto “La vida secreta de los datos” (cuya sigla en inglés es SLO-data) sigue el ciclo de vida de los datos desde su recolección en campo hasta su almacenamiento en un repositorio digital para entender oportunidades y retos relacionados con su interpretación, publicación y conservación. Nuestro enfoque basado en “datos lentos” (“Slow data”) no busca maximizar la velocidad y cantidad de datos; al contrario, enfatiza su curación, contextualización, comunicación y mayor comprensión. Gracias a un planteamiento metodológico combinado que incluyó entrevistas, observaciones de campo y evaluación de datos de excavación, se elaboró una serie de recomendaciones (tanto técnicas como administrativas) para optimizar la creación y gestión práctica de datos. Presentamos los resultados del estudio y ofrecemos consejos para racionalizar la recolección de datos en campo con el fin de facilitar su reutilización futura.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Faniel","given":"Ixchel M."},{"family":"Austin","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Kansa","given":"Eric C."},{"family":"Whitcher Kansa","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"France","given":"Phoebe"},{"family":"Jacobs","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Boytner","given":"Ran"},{"family":"Yakel","given":"Elizabeth"}],"citation-key":"faniel2018","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2018.2","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5]]},"language":"en","page":"105-116","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Beyond the Archive: Bridging Data Creation and Reuse in Archaeology","title-short":"Beyond the Archive","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/beyond-the-archive/3689E269FF895FC9E24345AF3D890916","volume":"6"},

It also introduces several new context types. Relying on the perspective of researchers offers a more nuanced view that shows the importance of the different context types for each discipline and the ways disciplinary members thought about them. Both data producers and curators can benefit from knowing what to capture and manage during data collection and deposit into a repository.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Faniel","given":"Ixchel M."},{"family":"Frank","given":"Rebecca D."},{"family":"Yakel","given":"Elizabeth"}],"citation-key":"faniel2019","container-title":"Journal of Documentation","container-title-short":"JD","DOI":"10.1108/JD-08-2018-0133","ISSN":"0022-0418","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,26]]},"language":"en","page":"1274-1297","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Context from the data reuser’s point of view","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JD-08-2018-0133/full/html","volume":"75"},

How can one approach this stake without removing or overlooking its vestigial character? The term hyperart is introduced to develop the concept of vestigial objects. Hyperart was conceived by the Japanese artist and author Akasegawa Genpei, who defined it as ‘useless but beautifully preserved objects connected to some form of real estate’. That is, things that in one way or another have become vestigial and meaningless. An underlying link is shown between the concept hyperart and an archaeologically inspired approach to the material world. The rudimentary and detached are regarded as an integral part of the anthropogenic environment, and it is theorised that such recognition is important in depicting both past and contemporary human environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Farstadvoll","given":"Stein"}],"citation-key":"farstadvoll2019a","container-title":"Norwegian Archaeological Review","DOI":"10.1080/00293652.2019.1577913","ISSN":"0029-3652","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,11]]},"page":"1-19","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Vestigial Matters: Contemporary Archaeology and Hyperart","title-short":"Vestigial Matters","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00293652.2019.1577913","volume":"0"},

  {"id":"fernandes2018a","abstract":"Bringing together apparently opposing modern and post-modern approaches to interpretation is one of the challenges that lie ahead for rock-art studies. This endeavour may help to surmount ‘no interpretation is possible’ stances (see Bednarik, 2014) and to value rock-art as a diverse and complex phenomenon where precise significance is concealed within multiple meaning-carrying conveyors. The idea that different rock-art traditions (as with any other art form) made use of a given set of symbols (also) aiming to enforce an ‘imagined’ order is instrumental to the present paper. Ancient imagery, despite precise production contexts, materializes the need to resort to visual symbols in order to help maintain social concord, regardless of exact meaning. However, this is a dynamic process; whenever there is an effort to uphold a certain set of moral and social complying principles, there are also nonconformist and subversive attempts to challenge and mutate that same collection of rules.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Fernandes","given":"António Batarda"}],"citation-key":"fernandes2018a","container-title":"Open Archaeology","DOI":"10.1515/opar-2018-0017","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"280–298","source":"DeGruyter","title":"The Entrapment of Art: Rock-Art, Order, Subversion, Creativity, Meaning, and the Appeal of Illusive Imagery","title-short":"The Entrapment of Art","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/opar.2018.4.issue-1/opar-2018-0017/opar-2018-0017.xml?format=INT","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"ferreira2013","abstract":"Epidemiology research is a truly multidisciplinary subject, relying on areas of knowledge as diverse as medicine, biology, statistics, sociology and geography.1 The creation of large-scale epidemiological models and the development of effective model-based prediction methods can only be achieved if efficient data collection techniques based on reliable policies for data sharing between research communities and health authorities are adopted.2 As a research domain that so strongly depends on heterogeneous data from diverse origins, epidemiology greatly requires a proper integrative framework to cope with its inherent multidisciplinarity.\n\nOne promising way to meet these requirements is the adoption by the epidemiology community of Semantic Web technologies. The Semantic Web is a vision of information management and sharing that promotes intelligent access to data on the world wide web, both by human beings and by computers.3 The adoption of the Semantic Web is not new in biomedical research: for instance, in molecular biology, it has been applied in the past with intent to create successful applications. One of these is GoPubMed, a platform that enables a deep and structured exploration of PubMed abstracts4; another one is a method to identify gene functions associated with specific biological phenomena.5\n\nThe remainder of this manuscript will illustrate the advantages of adopting this paradigm for epidemiological studies, together with a brief introduction of standard Semantic Web concepts and practices, that could be useful for current and prospective epidemiologists. We also present the Epidemic Marketplace, a case study for storing and describing epidemiological resources following the Semantic Web vision.\n\nThe world wide web is, by itself, an extremely useful content-sharing platform, but the content of its resources is not expressed through a common data format and is mainly directed at human users. To achieve machine-readability, the Semantic Web perceives information as resources …","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Ferreira","given":"João D."},{"family":"Paolotti","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Couto","given":"Francisco M."},{"family":"Silva","given":"Mário J."}],"citation-key":"ferreira2013","container-title":"J Epidemiol Community Health","container-title-short":"J Epidemiol Community Health","DOI":"10.1136/jech-2012-201142","ISSN":"0143-005X, 1470-2738","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",5,1]]},"language":"en","license":"Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

  {"id":"feyerabend1993","abstract":"Modern philosophy of science has paid great attention to the understanding of scientific 'practice', in contrast to concentration on scientific 'method'. Paul Feyerabend's acclaimed work, which has contributed greatly to this new emphasis, shows the deficiencies of some widespread ideas about the nature of knowledge. He argues that the only feasible explanations of scientific successes are historical explanations, and that anarchism must now replace rationalism in the theory of knowledge.  The third edition of this classic text contains a new preface and additional reflections at various points in which the author takes account both of recent debates on science and on the impact of scientific products and practices on the human community. While disavowing populism or relativism, Feyerabend continues to insist that the voice of the inexpert must be heard. Thus many environmental perils were first identified by non-experts against prevailing assumptions in the scientific community. Feyerabend's challenging reassessment of scientific claims and understandings are as pungent and timely as ever.","author":[{"family":"Feyerabend","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"feyerabend1993","ISBN":"978-0-86091-646-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"308","publisher":"Verso","source":"Google Books","title":"Against Method","type":"book"},

  {"id":"fillon2024","abstract":"We wish to express our concern for the role of for-profit scientific publishers in understanding and appropriating what “Open Science” means. This role can be characterised as opportunistic, and has led to an interpretation that can cause considerable confusion when we identify Open Science with Open Access and Open Access with \"paying for publishing”. This simplistic approach to what Open Science entails has led to poor quality publications, hindering the improvement of researchers' practices and culture. We discuss and clarify issues, identifying “false friends”, misunderstandings and misleading interpretations of Open Science. A superficial interpretation, sometimes driven by vested interests or simply due to the proliferation of bad practices, leads to unethical behaviour or simply opportunism, in the ‘publish and perish’ context where Open Science has developed. We then provide guidance on challenges and potential solutions for all stakeholders to increase rigour and credibility in science, through a genuine researcher perspective of Open Science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Fillon","given":"Adrien"},{"family":"Maniadis","given":"Zacharias"},{"family":"Méndez","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Sánchez-Núñez","given":"Pablo"}],"citation-key":"fillon2024","container-title":"Open Research Europe","container-title-short":"Open Res Europe","DOI":"10.12688/openreseurope.17694.1","ISSN":"2732-5121","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,28]]},"language":"en","page":"127","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Should we be wary of the role of scientific publishers in Open Science?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://open-research-europe.ec.europa.eu/articles/4-127/v1","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"filzwieser2017","abstract":"The complementary use of various archaeological prospection data sets offers a series of new possibilities for the investigation of prehistoric settlements. In addition to the separate interpretations of the single methods, the implementation of image fusion provides an additional tool to obtain an even higher degree of data integration during the interpretation process. To investigate some possibilities and risks of image fusion, a procedure frequently used in the medical field but rarely applied in archaeology, various algorithms inside a dedicated MATLAB toolbox TAIFU (Toolbox for Archaeological Image FUsion) were tested on the geophysical prospection data from an Iron Age settlement near Vesterager in West Jutland, Denmark. The Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology had conducted large-scale, high-resolution ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and magnetometry surveys at the site in 2014, based on its discovery by the Ringkøbing Museum through aerial photos and the results of a follow-up excavation in 2009. The aim was to determine if, and to what extent, geophysical prospection together with a novel integrative interpretational approach was able to add more detailed information to an already known prehistoric settlement. Results yielded a variety of deeper insights into the separate farms (dated to around AD 400), including the discovery of several new structures and more information about the construction of the longhouses, as well as a first suggestion on how to implement image fusion into the process of analysis and archaeological interpretation of geophysical data sets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Filzwieser","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Olesen","given":"Lis Helles"},{"family":"Verhoeven","given":"Geert"},{"family":"Mauritsen","given":"Esben Schlosser"},{"family":"Neubauer","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Trinks","given":"Immo"},{"family":"Nowak","given":"Milena"},{"family":"Nowak","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Schneidhofer","given":"Petra"},{"family":"Nau","given":"Erich"},{"family":"Gabler","given":"Manuel"}],"citation-key":"filzwieser2017","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-017-9338-y","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",5,24]]},"language":"en","page":"1-21","source":"link-springer-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca","title":"Integration of Complementary Archaeological Prospection Data from a Late Iron Age Settlement at Vesterager—Denmark","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-017-9338-y"},

Such a scope raises important ethical questions fundamental to the practice of remote-sensed archaeology, and this paper contributes to this discussion by reflecting on EAMENA's unique role in this subfield. We present ethical issues and possible solutions related to remote sensing and archaeology, drawing on models developed within the humanitarian aid sector and postcolonial archaeology. In addition, we consider issues of national sovereignty and their relationship to the engagement of local communities.

  {"id":"flache2018","abstract":"Social influence is one of the most important processes in human social interaction. Very often in human social interaction, influence is assimilative in that individuals become more similar to others they interact with. Nevertheless, cultural differences continue to remain in many realms of human life, for example, in the form of technological boundaries. Research on social influence points to a range of possible reasons for persistent cultural diversity, but there is much less clarity about the interplay of various factors and conditions for cultural influence with fundamental processes of social interaction at the micro-level. In this article, I show how agent-based computational modeling can be used as an approach for unraveling the complex interplay between simple first principles of interpersonal social interaction and emergent societal outcomes. I give a brief overview illustrating some of the main approaches agent-based modelers have developed in recent decades to understand conditions and processes of the emergence of cultural diversity. Models will be discussed that generate mainly cultural consensus as long-term behavior, but also models that generate clustering of cultural attitudes in geographical or social space, and models that imply cultural polarization with sharp cultural boundaries between emergent factions. It will be discussed how model dynamics depend on further assumptions, for example about random events, or the scaling of cultural attitudes, and what are further developments in the literature, possible future directions and challenges for the application of computational agent-based modeling in archeological research on cultural boundaries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Flache","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"flache2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-018-9391-1","ISSN":"1573-7764","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"996-1023","source":"Springer Link","title":"Between Monoculture and Cultural Polarization: Agent-based Models of the Interplay of Social Influence and Cultural Diversity","title-short":"Between Monoculture and Cultural Polarization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-018-9391-1","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"forest2020","abstract":"After acquiring 91 km2 of lidar data from the Zacapu region, West Mexico, we confronted a series of issues that most archaeologists using this technology face. These include the large volume of data available, the limited training of potential “analysts,” the difficult development of a collective mapping tool and protocol, and the reliability of desk-based interpretation of archaeological features. In this article, we present an initiative conducted in 2015 and 2017 as an attempt to answer these methodological and pedagogical issues. We developed a web mapping platform to collectively interpret archaeological features using lidar-derived imagery and to train volunteer students to participate in this desk-based web mapping within a crowdsourcing framework. After evaluating the results of this initiative, we discuss the potential and limitations of this method for both lidar-based research and future training., Después de adquirir 91 km2 de datos lidar para la región de Zacapu, Occidente de México, nos hemos enfrentados a una serie de problemas recurrentes en el uso de esta tecnología en arqueología.

  {"id":"fortier2017","abstract":"Background: It is widely accepted and acknowledged that data harmonization is crucial: in its absence, the co-analysis of major tranches of high quality extant data is liable to inefficiency or error. However, despite its widespread practice, no formalized/systematic guidelines exist to ensure high quality retrospective data harmonization.Methods: To better understand real-world harmonization practices and facilitate development of formal guidelines, three interrelated initiatives were undertaken between 2006 and 2015. They included a phone survey with 34 major international research initiatives, a series of workshops with experts, and case studies applying the proposed guidelines.Results: A wide range of projects use retrospective harmonization to support their research activities but even when appropriate approaches are used, the terminologies, procedures, technologies and methods adopted vary markedly. The generic guidelines outlined in this article delineate the essentials required and describe an interdependent step-by-step approach to harmonization: 0) define the research question, objectives and protocol; 1) assemble pre-existing knowledge and select studies; 2) define targeted variables and evaluate harmonization potential; 3) process data; 4) estimate quality of the harmonized dataset(s) generated; and 5) disseminate and preserve final harmonization products.Conclusions: This manuscript provides guidelines aiming to encourage rigorous and effective approaches to harmonization which are comprehensively and transparently documented and straightforward to interpret and implement. This can be seen as a key step towards implementing guiding principles analogous to those that are well recognised as being essential in securing the foundational underpinning of systematic reviews and the meta-analysis of clinical trials.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Fortier","given":"Isabel"},{"family":"Raina","given":"Parminder"},{"family":"Van den Heuvel","given":"Edwin R"},{"family":"Griffith","given":"Lauren E"},{"family":"Craig","given":"Camille"},{"family":"Saliba","given":"Matilda"},{"family":"Doiron","given":"Dany"},{"family":"Stolk","given":"Ronald P"},{"family":"Knoppers","given":"Bartha M"},{"family":"Ferretti","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Granda","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Burton","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"fortier2017","container-title":"International Journal of Epidemiology","container-title-short":"International Journal of Epidemiology","DOI":"10.1093/ije/dyw075","ISSN":"0300-5771","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",2,1]]},"page":"103-105","source":"Silverchair","title":"Maelstrom Research guidelines for rigorous retrospective data harmonization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyw075","volume":"46"},
  {"id":"foster2003","abstract":"Discusses the concept of 'serendipity' in the context of information seeking from the dual viewpoints of its classical origin in literature and its more modern manifestation in the realm of problem solving and knowledge acquisition of humanities and science scholars. Reviews the literature of serendipitous information searching to discuss the utility of the notion of serendipity. Presents the analysis as part of a larger study concerning the information seeking behaviour of interdisciplinary scholars and considers the nature of serendipity in such contexts and reinterprets the notion of serendipity as a phenomenon arising from both conditions and strategies (purposive and non-purposive component) of information seeking and knowledge acquisition. Reports the results of a study, involving open-ended interviews with academic and postgraduate researchers from 100 research groups to explore their serendipitous encounters during their research. Concludes from the results that: serendipity was widely experienced among interdisciplinary researchers, serendipity may relate to the impact of new information on the research process (whether or not the information was encountered by chance), serendipity may also relate to the chance encountering of information (whether or not this information had an unexpected impact on the research), and certain attitudes and strategic decisions were perceived to be effective in exploiting serendipity when it occurred.","author":[{"family":"Foster","given":"Allen"},{"family":"Ford","given":"Nigel"}],"citation-key":"foster2003","container-title":"Journal of Documentation","DOI":"10.1108/00220410310472518","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",6,1]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Serendipity and Information Seeking: An Empirical Study","title-short":"Serendipity and Information Seeking","type":"article-journal","volume":"59"},

  {"id":"fotiadis1993","abstract":"This paper takes a close look at the relationship of an archaeological team engaged on a regional survey for the Greek Archaeological Service to the local population, and at the practices and scholastic assumptions of the archaeologists. Regional survey, with its emphasis on populations and resources is found to resemble the work of census takers and bureaucrats (and not surprisingly many locals see the archaeologists as representatives of the state). Prehistoric farmers are treated as 'sensible' and apolitical, and archaeology is seen to adopt refined tactics that domesticate the unfamiliar and banish the difficult and contradictory from concern. The intellectual safety of demographic approaches becomes clearer when the multiplicity of relations between the team and the locals is considered - precisely the variety missing from the texts written about the past - and when the archaeologists attempt to banish local life and politics from their narratives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Fotiadis","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"fotiadis1993","container-title":"Journal of European Archaeology","DOI":"10.1179/096576693800719310","ISSN":"0965-7665","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993",9,1]]},"page":"151-168","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Regions of the Imagination: Archaeologists, Local People, and the Archaeological Record in Fieldwork, Greece","title-short":"Regions of the Imagination","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/096576693800719310","volume":"1"},
  {"id":"fotiadis1994","abstract":"In her recent work, Alison Wylie has sometimes claimed an important role for present politics in the constitution of archaeological facts, yet she has not fully documented such claims. Using the same materials as Wylie, namely the research on gender presented at the conference \"Women and Production in Prehistory,\" held in South Carolina in 1988, I attempt to provide such documentation, arguing that its absence may undermine Wylie's (indeed, archaeology's) \"mitigated objectivism\" as well as the facts emerging about prehistoric gender. I dispute neither the scientific integrity of those facts nor the rigor of Wylie's analysis. Like many before me, I puzzle about the relationship between truth and politics, and I regard the disjunction of the two notions, so obdurate in archaeology, as counterproductive, the source of contradictions and disabling ambivalences. I make at the end two suggestions about overcoming the notional disjunction of truth and politics, one adopted from Brumfiel and from Conkey (archaeological facts as allegories), the other from Foucault (archaeological evidence as a network of sites of power).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Fotiadis","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"fotiadis1994","container-title":"American Antiquity","DOI":"10.2307/282467","ISSN":"0002-7316","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1994"]]},"page":"545-555","source":"JSTOR","title":"What is Archaeology's \"Mitigated Objectivism\" Mitigated by?

It seems especially paradoxical that archaeology students, who are at least partly attracted to the subject by the image of a ‘hands-on’, ‘real’ experience of pastness—“nose to nose,” in Segalen’s phrase—are nevertheless culturally conditioned to expect knowledge to be packaged in words. This tension between a longing for ‘presence’ and the distancing produced by disciplinary framing is central to the problems of current education in the Humanities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Fotiadis","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"fotiadis2013","collection-title":"Transcultural Research – Heidelberg Studies on Asia and Europe in a Global Context","container-title":"Modernity's Classics","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-642-33071-1_13","ISBN":"978-3-642-33070-4 978-3-642-33071-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","page":"293-313","publisher":"Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Naked Presence and Disciplinary Wording","type":"chapter","URL":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-33071-1_13"},

  {"id":"frahm2013b","abstract":"The response from Speakman and Shackley to my paper highlights a number of important issues currently facing archaeological sourcing research. Many of these issues, however, have little to do with HHpXRF itself and more to do with an artificial crisis triggered by specialists' concerns about a hitherto restricted technique becoming available to a wider community. Despite their mantra of “validity and reliability,” Speakman and Shackley erroneously equate these two concepts with the accuracy of an instrument's measurements. Additionally, they mischaracterise a self-contained test, conducted with specific parameters (i.e., “off-the-shelf” operation), as an endeavour to facilitate or endorse poor-quality data. Paradoxically, their disparagement of experimental internal consistency as “silliness” is incongruous with their own data. Furthermore, a discussion focused on handheld instruments is obfuscated by their inclusion of desktop instruments that are “portable” only in the sense of luggable to an electrical outlet in a laboratory context. Most troubling is that they envision themselves as the arbiters of science vs. “playing scientist.” Contrary to their claims, HHpXRF proliferation will improve reproducibility and archaeological results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Frahm","given":"Ellery"}],"citation-key":"frahm2013b","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2012.10.001","ISSN":"0305-4403","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",2,1]]},"page":"1444-1448","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Is obsidian sourcing about geochemistry or archaeology?

  {"id":"frahm2014c","abstract":"Portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) has been demonstrated as a powerful tool to assign obsidian artifacts to sources. Newer instruments can even match artifacts from some regions to their sources in a matter of just seconds, not minutes. There remains, however, a reluctance to use pXRF instruments to characterize the sources themselves. Many past studies have used pXRF in a region where the sources have been well characterized using lab-based techniques. That is, earlier analytical work established compositional types for the obsidian sources, and pXRF was later used to sort artifacts into those types. This is due, at least in part, to notions that pXRF instruments are insufficiently accurate or reliable to characterize the sources. The motivations to use pXRF for characterizing sources are similar to those for sourcing artifacts: many more specimens can be analyzed without concern for the financial, practical, and legal considerations associated with instruments in distant facilities. This paper documents tests conducted to investigate the accuracy and reproducibility of pXRF data relative to five laboratory-based techniques (NAA, EDXRF, WDXRF, EMPA, and LA-ICP-MS) with a focus on Armenian obsidian sources. These tests demonstrate that there is no reason to believe pXRF is inherently inaccurate, unreproducible, or otherwise inadequate for source characterization. A case study of the Pokr Arteni source highlights the advantages of pXRF, including the capability to analyze large numbers of specimens, recognize variability, and elucidate field relationships. In these respects, pXRF can facilitate more sophisticated obsidian sourcing studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Frahm","given":"Ellery"}],"citation-key":"frahm2014c","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2014.05.003","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",9,1]]},"page":"105-125","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Characterizing obsidian sources with portable XRF: accuracy, reproducibility, and field relationships in a case study from Armenia","title-short":"Characterizing obsidian sources with portable XRF","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440314001630","volume":"49"},

  {"id":"frahm2018","abstract":"The complexities of Later Stone Age environmental and behavioral variability in East Africa remain poorly defined, and toolstone sourcing is essential to understand the scale of the social and natural landscapes encountered by earlier human populations. The Naivasha-Nakuru Basin in Kenya's Rift Valley is a region that is not only highly sensitive to climatic changes but also one of the world's most obsidian-rich landscapes. We used portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) analyses of obsidian artifacts and geological specimens to understand patterns of toolstone acquisition and consumption reflected in the early/middle Holocene strata (Phases 3–4 of the Eburran industry) at Gamble's Cave II. Our analyses represent the first geochemical source identifications of obsidian artifacts from the Eburran industry and indicate the persistent selection over time for high-quality obsidian from Mt. Eburru, ~20 km distant, despite changes in site occupation intensity that apparently correlate with changes in the local environment. This result may indicate resilience of Eburran foraging strategies during environmental shifts and, potentially, a cultural preference for a specific lithic material that overcame its accessibility changes. Testing such hypotheses requires a more extensive program of obsidian artifact sourcing. Our findings demonstrate the great potential for sourcing studies in the Rift Valley as well as underscore the amount of work that remains to be done.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Frahm","given":"Ellery"},{"family":"Tryon","given":"Christian A."}],"citation-key":"frahm2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2018.01.042","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,1]]},"page":"475-486","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Later Stone Age toolstone acquisition in the Central Rift Valley of Kenya: Portable XRF of Eburran obsidian artifacts from Leakey's excavations at Gamble's Cave II","title-short":"Later Stone Age toolstone acquisition in the Central Rift Valley of Kenya","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X17305114","volume":"18"},

Their main purpose is facilitating collaborations and “big data” projects, and the PYRO sets were designed to complement existing protocols for calibration and evaluation.

  {"id":"frahm2019a","abstract":"The Hellenistic, Parthian, and Roman site of Dura–Europos (or simply “Dura”), dubbed the “Pompeii of the Syrian Desert” by Yale historian and archaeologist Michael Rostovtzeff, was jointly excavated by Yale University and the French Academy of Inscriptions and Letters from 1928 to 1937. Given the outstanding preservation of art and architecture at Dura, it is not surprising that four obsidian artifacts have escaped attention, despite evidence that stone tools – including obsidian ones – continued to be used into and after the Iron Age in the Eastern Mediterranean. After more than eight decades, the character of Dura's connections to the Classical world remains a matter of debate. Pottery includes not only local ceramic wares but also North African and Aegean ones. Our nondestructive pXRF testing establish that the Dura artifacts match the three most widely used Eastern Anatolian obsidian sources: Nemrut Dağ volcano as well as the Bingöl A and B sources. If indeed obsidian arrived at Dura via long-standing mechanisms of Mesopotamian exchange, these Eastern Anatolian obsidians would be expected. Unfortunately, the artifacts' precise locations at Dura are unclear, the excavations lacked stratigraphic constraints, and Near Eastern obsidian distribution patterns have been rarely studied beyond the Early Bronze Age.

  {"id":"frahm2019b","abstract":"The corpus of sourced obsidian glyptic objects, like inscribed amulets and cylinder seals, is virtually nonexistent across the Near East. Here we report our findings for two obsidian amulets and two cylinder seals in the Yale Babylonian Collection and Metropolitan Museum of Art. We analyzed the artifacts using portable X-ray fluorescence, which is quantitative, nondestructive, and deployable virtually anywhere in the world. Our results establish that, for such objects, style is an unreliable predictor of obsidian source. Although the amulets are meant to protect against the same demon, they reflect different styles, skill in stone cutting, and knowledge of cuneiform, and their contexts of production must have considerably differed. The amulets' obsidian sources, however, are identical: the Kömürcü outcrops of the Göllü Dağ volcanic complex in Anatolia. The two cylinder seals exhibit typical Old Babylonian style and iconography, and the seals' obsidians are indistinguishable to the naked eye. One seal, however, matches the Anatolian “Bingöl B\" source, one of the most important sources in Mesopotamia. The other seal matches an obsidian source that is only known from a vessel fragment unearthed from the Egyptian site of Abydos. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that Egyptian-tied obsidian has been chemically identified amongst Mesopotamian, Anatolian, or Levantine artifacts. Our findings tantalizingly suggest that such artifacts likely had more complex origins than has previously been appreciated. These results also hint that such objects might have been produced closer to the context of their use rather than nearer the volcanic sources of the stone.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Frahm","given":"Ellery"},{"family":"Lassen","given":"Agnete Wisti"},{"family":"Wagensonner","given":"Klaus"}],"citation-key":"frahm2019b","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.03.025","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"page":"978-992","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Gods and demons, Anatolia and Egypt: Obsidian sourcing of Mesopotamian amulets and cylinder seals using portable XRF","title-short":"Gods and demons, Anatolia and Egypt","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18308137","volume":"24"},
  {"id":"frahm2019c","abstract":"Given the importance of the Levant in understanding the origins and dispersals of modern humans, there has been great interest in archaeological evidence to support population movements between the Levant and adjacent regions. The link, if any, between the Aurignacian tradition across Europe and the “Levantine Aurignacian” is a particular focus. Ksar Akil in Lebanon not only is one of the most deeply stratified Levantine sites but also has the longest record of Upper Paleolithic behaviors, so it is a benchmark to which developments in the Levant are often compared. Schmidt and Zimmermann (2019) recently proposed that the European Aurignacian tradition might best be understood in terms of connectivity, as evidenced by long-distance lithic transfers that can act as a proxy for mobility and social networks. Here we document a previously unreported obsidian burin from Ksar Akil. Portable X-ray fluorescence reveals that it matches a source ≥700 km away on foot in central Turkey. Two recent dating programs have calculated ages of ~41–38 and ~39–37 ka cal BP for its layer, which also included an obsidian flake and immediately precedes the Levantine Aurignacian at the site. The obsidian artifacts from Ksar Akil are roughly contemporaneous obsidian from Yabroud Rockshelter II in Syria and Shanidar Cave in Iraq. Such instances of long-distance obsidian transport imply that connectivity might have risen ahead of the Levantine and Zagros Aurignacian. Unfortunately, due to the limited chronological resolution of older excavations at these sites, only at Ksar Akil can we have confidence that the layer containing obsidian artifacts immediately precedes the earliest Levantine Aurignacian sensu stricto layer. Given the apparent rarity of obsidian in the Levant, this region will benefit from endeavors to nondestructively source other toolstone materials as a means to create datasets similar to those recently used to model cultural areas of the European Aurignacian.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Frahm","given":"Ellery"},{"family":"Tryon","given":"Christian A."}],"citation-key":"frahm2019c","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.102060","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"102060","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Origin of an Early Upper Palaeolithic obsidian burin at Ksar Akil (Lebanon): Evidence of increased connectivity ahead of the Levantine Aurignacian?","title-short":"Origin of an Early Upper Palaeolithic obsidian burin at Ksar Akil (Lebanon)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X19305310","volume":"28"},
  {"id":"frahm2022","abstract":"Exchange networks created by Neolithic pastoral transhumance have been central to explaining the distant transport of obsidian since chemical analysis was first used to attribute Near Eastern artifacts to their volcanic origins in the 1960s. Since then, critical reassessments of floral, faunal, and chronological data have upended long-held interpretations regarding the emergence of food production and have demonstrated that far-traveled, nomadic pastoralists were more myth than reality, at least during the Neolithic. Despite debates regarding their proposed conveyance mechanisms, obsidian artifacts’ transport has received relatively little attention compared with zooarchaeological and archaeobotanical lines of investigation. The rise of nondestructive and portable instruments permits entire obsidian assemblages to be traced to their sources, renewing their significance in elucidating connections among early pastoral and agricultural communities. Here we share our findings about the obsidian artifacts excavated from the sites of Ali Kosh and Chagha Sefid in the southern Zagros. In the 1960s and 1970s, 28 obsidian artifacts from the sites were destructively tested, and the remainder were sorted by color. Our results emphasize a dynamic, accelerating connectivity among the Early and Late Neolithic communities. Here we propose and support an alternative model for obsidian distribution among more settled communities. In brief, diversity in the obsidian assemblage accelerated diachronically, an invisible trend in the earlier studies. Our model of increasing population densities is supported by archaeological data and computational simulations, offering insights regarding the Neolithic Demographic Transition in the Zagros, an equivalent of which is commonly thought to have occurred around the world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Frahm","given":"Ellery"},{"family":"Carolus","given":"Christina M."}],"citation-key":"frahm2022","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2109321119","issue":"43","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,25]]},"page":"e2109321119","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"pnas.org (Atypon)","title":"Identifying the origins of obsidian artifacts in the Deh Luran Plain (Southwestern Iran) highlights community connections in the Neolithic Zagros","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2109321119","volume":"119"},
  {"id":"frahm2023","abstract":"It has been 25 years since the publication of the monograph L'obsidienne au Proche et Moyen Orient: Du volcan à l'outil (Cauvin et al., 1998) and, within it, Poidevin’s (1998) chapter that summarized all available geochemical and geochronological data for obsidian sources in Turkey and the Caucasus. It was a highly valuable resource to those of us working on Near Eastern obsidian sourcing in the early 2000s; however, an update is long overdue. Poidevin (1998) compiled 229 analyses for obsidian sources in eastern Turkey and the Caucasus, and while he recognized the importance of independent analytical data, he was also frustrated that the few available data obscured real differences in obsidian composition versus variation among the different analytical facilities. Today we are closer to Poidevin’s (1998) goal. Here I summarize more than 7300 elemental analyses for 58 geochemically distinct obsidian sources. For example, Poidevin (1998) had just two analyses for Meydan Dağ, a highly important obsidian source, whereas here I report consensus values for 22 elements in Meydan Dağ obsidian based on 423 analyses from 25 independent techniques and laboratories. Not all 58 of the known obsidian sources within this region, however, have been so well characterized, and it is clear that there remains work to be done.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Frahm","given":"Ellery"}],"citation-key":"frahm2023","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2023.104011","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"104011","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The obsidian sources of eastern Turkey and the Caucasus: Geochemistry, geology, and geochronology","title-short":"The obsidian sources of eastern Turkey and the Caucasus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X23001864","volume":"49"},

  {"id":"franceschini2016","abstract":"Recent studies have shown that the Scopus bibliometric database is probably less accurate than one thinks. As a further evidence of this fact, this paper presents a structured collection of several weird typologies of database errors, which can therefore be classified as horrors. Some of them concern the incorrect indexing of so-called Online-First paper, duplicate publications, and the missing/incorrect indexing of references. A crucial point is that most of these errors could probably be avoided by adopting some basic data checking systems. Although this paper does not provide a quantitative and systematic analysis (which will be provided in a future publication), it can be easily understood that these errors can have serious consequences such as: (i) making it difficult or even impossible to retrieve some documents, and (ii) distorting bibliometric indicators/metrics relating to journals, individual scientists or research institutions. Our attention is focused on the Scopus database, although preliminary data show that the Web of Science database is far from being free from these errors. The tone of the paper is deliberately provocative, in order to emphasize the seriousness of these errors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Franceschini","given":"Fiorenzo"},{"family":"Maisano","given":"Domenico"},{"family":"Mastrogiacomo","given":"Luca"}],"citation-key":"franceschini2016","container-title":"Journal of Informetrics","container-title-short":"Journal of Informetrics","DOI":"10.1016/j.joi.2015.11.006","ISSN":"1751-1577","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,1]]},"page":"174-182","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The museum of errors/horrors in Scopus","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157715301462","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"franck2013","abstract":"Empirical research often lacks theory. This book progressively works out a method of constructing models which can bridge the gap between empirical and theoretical research in the social sciences. This might improve the explanatory power of models. The issue is quite novel, and it benefited from a thorough examination of statistical and mathematical models, conceptual models, diagrams and maps, machines, computer simulations, and artificial neural networks. These modelling practices have been approached through different disciplines.  The proposed method is partly inspired by reverse engineering. The standard covering law approach is abandoned, and classical induction restored to its rightful place. It helps to solve several difficulties which impact upon the social sciences today, for example how to extend an explanatory model to new phenomena, how to establish laws, and how to guide the choice of a conceptual structure.  The book can be used for advanced courses in research methods in the social sciences and in philosophy of science.","author":[{"family":"Franck","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"franck2013","ISBN":"978-1-4020-4676-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",11,11]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"305","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","source":"Google Books","title":"The Explanatory Power of Models: Bridging the Gap between Empirical and Theoretical Research in the Social Sciences","title-short":"The Explanatory Power of Models","type":"book"},

  {"id":"frankland2015","abstract":"The thesis takes a novel approach to the design and evaluation of technologies for archaeological fieldwork. As digital technologies are often developed or appropriated by archaeologists for the purpose of acquiring or improving the management of archaeological data, the thesis instead explores how digital technologies can benefit fieldwork teams by supporting communication and awareness. The thesis begins by demonstrating how the development of archaeological computing has resulted in a focus on developing or appropriating digital technologies that support the acquisition and management of archaeological data. Following this, the results of ethnographic field studies conducted at four excavation sites are discussed. These studies explored how archaeologists communicated on-site, their awareness of one another’s activities, and their work practices around existing and novel technologies. The results of the ethnography are followed up with a technology probe conducted at a field school at Itchen Abbas, UK. The findings from these studies were subsequently used to derive design implications for a novel technology aimed at improving archaeologists’ awareness and communication when working in the field. A prototype technology was then built, deployed in the field, evaluated and iterated upon, with a final evaluation conducted in the field. The first deployment promoted conversation, however some archaeologists found the visualisations complicated and difficult to interpret. A second deployment was therefore designed to address this. When re-deployed, archaeologists spent a large amount of time discussing the intervention, and also re-appropriated it for playful interaction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Frankland","given":"Tom"}],"citation-key":"frankland2015","contributor":[{"family":"Frankland","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Earl","given":"Graeme"},{"family":"Costanza","given":"Enrico"}],"genre":"masters","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9]]},"language":"en","license":"uos_thesis","number-of-pages":"115","publisher":"University of Southampton","source":"eprints.soton.ac.uk","title":"Exploring novel technologies for archaeological fieldwork","type":"thesis","URL":"https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/421124/"},

I begin by critiquing the exclusively positive connotations of archaeology, digital technologies and public participation, before drawing on critiques of the ‘simple deficit model’ within science communication, which I argue are equally applicable to public archaeology. I use the ‘simple deficit model’ and a review of shifting perspectives on legitimate heritage expertise to lay the foundation for an archaeology that is both ‘open’ and ‘ethical’. I conclude that, as in science communication, such an archaeology requires archaeologists to develop more accurate understandings of both archaeology and publics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Fredheim","given":"L.

  {"id":"fricke2009","abstract":"The paper evaluates the data?information?knowledge?wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy. This hierarchy, also known as the `knowledge hierarchy', is part of the canon of information science and management. Arguments are offered that the hierarchy is unsound and methodologically undesirable. The paper identifies a central logical error that DIKW makes. The paper also identifies the dated and unsatisfactory philosophical positions of operationalism and inductivism as the philosophical backdrop to the hierarchy. The paper concludes with a sketch of some positive theories, of value to information science, on the nature of the components of the hierarchy: that data is anything recordable in a semantically and pragmatically sound way, that information is what is known in other literature as `weak knowledge', that knowledge also is `weak knowledge' and that wisdom is the possession and use, if required, of wide practical knowledge, by an agent who appreciates the fallible nature of that knowledge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Frické","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"fricke2009","container-title":"Journal of Information Science","DOI":"10.1177/0165551508094050","ISSN":"0165-5515","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"131-142","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The knowledge pyramid: a critique of the DIKW hierarchy","title-short":"The knowledge pyramid","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0165551508094050","volume":"35"},

  {"id":"fritz2016","abstract":"In an attempt to introduce concerns with social identities into the discussion and understanding of the making of what we call Paleolithic art, this article considers issues of gender, skill, apprenticeship, and tradition. We note that, as in every period of history, Paleolithic art can be seen as embedded in the society that studies it. Over the last 20 years, the research attention given to women in Paleolithic societies has grown considerably, leading us to ask what could have been the roles of women in Paleolithic art. On what criteria could we base a determination of those roles or of other social identities that were likely part of the making and viewing of Paleolithic art?Thanks to our microscopic analysis of engravings, it is possible to identify the skill level and expertise of the artists and thus to address the question of apprenticeship and how these techniques were transmitted. We observe many similarities that allow us to group together various works of art, sometimes from very distant sites, which indicate a movement of ideas, objects, and people. Are we talking about “imitation”? How can we define an “invention” within a social context strongly bound by traditions?","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Fritz","given":"Carole"},{"family":"Tosello","given":"Gilles"},{"family":"Conkey","given":"Margaret W."}],"citation-key":"fritz2016","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-015-9265-8","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1307-1332","source":"link-springer-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca","title":"Reflections on the Identities and Roles of the Artists in European Paleolithic Societies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-015-9265-8","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"fuller2012a","abstract":"Recent studies have suggested that domestication was a slower evolutionary process than was previously thought. We address this issue by quantifying rates of phenotypic change in crops undergoing domestication, including five crops from the Near East (Triticum monococcum, T. dicoccum, Hordeum vulgare, Pisum sativum, Lens culinaris) and six crops from other regions (Oryza sativa, Pennisetum glaucum, Vigna radiata, Cucumis melo, Helianthus annus, Iva annua). We calculate rates using the metrics of darwin units and haldane units, which have been used in evolutionary biology, and apply this to data on non-shattering cereal spikelets and seed size. Rates are calculated by considering data over a 4,000-year period from archaeological sites in the region of origin, although we discuss the likelihood that a shorter period of domestication (1,000–2,000) years may be more appropriate for some crops, such as pulses. We report broadly comparable rates of change across all the crops and traits considered, and find that these are close to the averages and median values reported in various evolutionary biological studies. Nevertheless, there is still variation in rates between domesticates, such as melon seeds increasing at twice the rate of cereals, and between traits, such as non-shattering evolving faster than grain size. Such comparisons underline the utility of a quantitative approach to domestication rates, and the need to develop larger datasets for comparisons between crops and across regions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Fuller","given":"Dorian Q."},{"family":"Asouti","given":"Eleni"},{"family":"Purugganan","given":"Michael D."}],"citation-key":"fuller2012a","container-title":"Vegetation History and Archaeobotany","container-title-short":"Veget Hist Archaeobot","DOI":"10.1007/s00334-011-0329-8","ISSN":"0939-6314, 1617-6278","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"131-145","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Cultivation as slow evolutionary entanglement: comparative data on rate and sequence of domestication","title-short":"Cultivation as slow evolutionary entanglement","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00334-011-0329-8","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"fyfe2007","abstract":"The nineteenth century was an age of transformation in science, when scientists were rewarded for their startling new discoveries with increased social status and authority. But it was also a time when ordinary people from across the social spectrum were given the opportunity to participate in science, for education, entertainment, or both. In Victorian Britain science could be encountered in myriad forms and in countless locations: in panoramic shows, exhibitions, and galleries; in city museums and country houses; in popular lectures; and even in domestic conversations that revolved around the latest books and periodicals. Science in the Marketplace reveals this other side of Victorian scientific life by placing the sciences in the wider cultural marketplace, ultimately showing that the creation of new sites and audiences was just as crucial to the growing public interest in science as were the scientists themselves. By focusing attention on the scientific audience, as opposed to the scientific community or self-styled popularizers, Science in the Marketplace ably links larger societal changes—in literacy, in industrial technologies, and in leisure—to the evolution of “popular science.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Fyfe","given":"Aileen"}],"citation-key":"fyfe2007","DOI":"10.7208/9780226150024","ISBN":"978-0-226-15002-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",9,10]]},"language":"en","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"Science in the Marketplace: Nineteenth-Century Sites and Experiences","title-short":"Science in the Marketplace","type":"book","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.7208/9780226150024/html"},

  {"id":"galeazzi2014","abstract":"This research aims to investigate the potential use of three-dimensional (3D) technologies for the analysis and interpretation of heritage sites. This article uses different 3D survey technologies to find the most appropriate methods to document archaeological stratigraphy, based on diverse environmental conditions, light exposures, and varied surfaces. The use of 3D laser scanners and dense stereo matching (DSM) techniques is now well established in archaeology. However, no convincing comparisons between those techniques have been presented. This research fills this gap to provide an accurate data assessment for the Las Cuevas site (Belize) and represents a starting point for the definition of a sharable methodology. Tests in Las Cuevas were conducted to compare both accuracy and density reliability in cave environments using two different techniques: triangulation light laser scanner and DSM. This study finds that DSM is the most economical, portable, and flexible approach for the 3D documentation of archaeological sites today. In fact, DSM allows the 3D documentation process to be done more efficiently, reducing both data acquisition and processing time. Nonetheless, the quantitative comparison presented in this paper underscores the need to integrate this technique with other technologies when the data acquisition of micro-stratigraphy is required.\n, \nEste ensayo analiza la potencialidad de las tecnologías 3D para el análisis e interpretación del patrimonio histórico y cultural. Este trabajo usa diferentes técnicas 3D con el fin de encontrar los métodos más apropiados para documentar la estratigrafía arqueológica, basados en diversas condiciones ambientales, exposición a la luz y variedad de superficies. A pesar de que actualmente se ha establecido el uso de las técnicas de laser escáner 3D y de la técnica fotogramétrica (DSM) “dense stereo matching” en el campo arqueológico, considero no convincentes las comparaciones que se han hecho hasta el presente entre estas dos técnicas. Esta investigación colma este vacío proveyendo una detallada evaluación de los datos de los asentamientos arqueológicos de Las Cuevas (Belize) y representa un punto de partida concreto hacia la definición de una metodología compartible. Utilizando dos técnicas diferentes, la triangulación de la luz del escáner láser y DSM, se hicieron análisis en Las Cuevas para comparar la precisión y la fiabilidad de densidad en entornos rupestres.

De hecho, el DSM permite el proceso de documentación 3D reduciendo tanto la adquisición de datos como el tiempo del proceso.

Since foodstuffs rarely survive in the archaeological record, proxy evidence forms the foundation of our analyses. Scholars must be critical of these data to ensure that they provide the most accurate illustration of ancient trends possible. There are also questions that are rarely asked of proxy data, such as why the products for which they provide evidence were appealing and how they were consumed. To explore these issues, the export and consumption of wine from Roman Crete during the first–third century ad serves as a case study. This product is identified primarily through finds of ceramic containers known as amphorae. Proxy evidence, like amphorae, is indispensable, but scholars must ensure that they maximize the potential of these data while examining the role that food surplus played in social development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Gallimore","given":"Scott"}],"citation-key":"gallimore2017","container-title":"World Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00438243.2016.1259582","ISSN":"0043-8243","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,1]]},"page":"138-150","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Food surplus and archaeological proxies: a case study from Roman Crete","title-short":"Food surplus and archaeological proxies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00438243.2016.1259582","volume":"49"},

With a long view of the ecological, economic, social, and political factors that promote the emergence and spread of infectious disease, archaeologists are well positioned to examine the antecedents of the present crisis. In this article, we bring together a variety of perspectives on the issues surrounding the emergence, spread, and effects of disease in both the Americas and Afro-Eurasian contexts. Recognizing that human populations most severely impacted by COVID-19 are typically descendants of marginalized groups, we investigate pre- and postcontact disease vectors among Indigenous and Black communities in North America, outlining the systemic impacts of diseases and the conditions that exacerbate their spread. We look at how material culture both reflects and changes as a result of social transformations brought about by disease, the insights that paleopathology provides about the ancient human condition, and the impacts of ancient globalization on the spread of disease worldwide. By understanding the differential effects of past epidemics on diverse communities and contributing to more equitable sociopolitical agendas, archaeology can play a key role in helping to pursue a more just future.\n, \nEste articulo surgió a medidas que atravesamos la peor pandemia mundial de un siglo.

We explore ways along which archaeological and artistic practices of improvisation become entangled and productive through their different modes of mark-making. We contend that marks and memories of artist and archaeologist alike emerge interactively, through the mutually constituting effects of the object of study, the tools of exploration and the practitioners themselves, when they are enmeshed in cross-modally bound activities. These include, but are not limited to, remote sensing, surveying, mattocking, trowelling, drawing, photographing, videoing and sound recording. These marks represent the co-signatories: the gesture of the often anonymous practitioners, the voice of the deposits, as well as the imprint of the tools, and their interplay creates a multi-threaded narrative documenting their modes of intra-action, in short, our practices.

  {"id":"gantley2018","abstract":"Theories developed and validated using ethnographic and historical resources are often difficult to examine using sparse or fragmentary archaeological material. However, a number of statistical techniques make it possible to integrate data from ethnographic, historical, and archaeological resources into a single analytical framework. This article introduces Material Correlates Analysis (MCA)—a new method of filling gaps in the archaeological data using a strategic combination of data collection, multidimensional scaling, principal component analysis, and generalized liner modeling. Generalized liner modeling is a particularly useful tool in formal inferential statistics for comparing a priori classified groups of historical and/or ethnographic (known) cases with archaeological (unknown) ones on the basis of relevant variables. MCA allows us to overcome the inherent material culture limitations regarding data on key variables by using available historical or ethnographic evidence to make statistically testable inferences regarding archaeological data. Using the Modes of Religiosity theory as an example, we demonstrate how major gaps in the evidentiary record can be overcome using the techniques we outline. Specifically, we use the MCA approach to ascertain whether the agricultural transition in southwest Asia was associated with a shift from an imagistic to an increasingly doctrinal mode of religiosity., Las teorías desarrolladas y validadas usando material etnográfico e histórico son frecuentemente difíciles de examinar cuando el material arqueológico disponible es escaso o fragmentario. No obstante, varias técnicas estadísticas permiten la integración de datos procedentes de material etnográfico, histórico y arqueológico en un único marco de análisis. Este artículo introduce el análisis de correlaciones materiales (MCA, por sus siglas en inglés), un novedoso método para colmar lagunas en el material arqueológico empleando una combinación estratégica de recogida de datos, escalamiento multidimensional (MDS), análisis de componentes principales (PCA) y modelo lineal generalizado (GLM). El GLM es una herramienta particularmente útil en estadística inferencial formal para comparar a priori grupos clasificados de casos históricos o etnográficos (conocidos) con casos arqueológicos (desconocidos) con base en determinadas variables de referencia. El MCA permite superar las limitaciones inherentes en la cultura material en relación con datos de variables clave utilizando datos históricos o etnográficos disponibles para realizar inferencias estadísticamente comprobables en los datos arqueológicos. Tomando como ejemplo la teoría de los modos de religiosidad (Whitehouse 1995), mostramos de qué manera pueden colmarse importantes lagunas en la evidencia disponible empleando las técnicas que destacamos. En particular, empleamos el MCA para comprobar si la transición agrícola en el suroeste asiático puede asociarse con un cambio en el modo de religiosidad, de imaginistico a paulatinamente doctrinal.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Gantley","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Whitehouse","given":"Harvey"},{"family":"Bogaard","given":"Amy"}],"citation-key":"gantley2018","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2018.9","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11]]},"language":"en","page":"328-341","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Material Correlates Analysis (MCA): An Innovative way of Examining Questions in Archaeology Using Ethnographic Data","title-short":"Material Correlates Analysis (MCA)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/material-correlates-analysis-mca/2B1D1BF5771350AA30ACB299BF98C79B","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"garcia-closas2023","abstract":"Data sharing is essential for reproducibility of epidemiologic research, replication of findings, pooled analyses in consortia efforts, and maximizing study value to address multiple research questions. However, barriers related to confidentiality, costs, and incentives often limit the extent and speed of data sharing. Epidemiological practices that follow Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) principles can address these barriers by making data resources findable with the necessary metadata, accessible to authorized users, and interoperable with other data, to optimize the reuse of resources with appropriate credit to its creators. We provide an overview of these principles and describe approaches for implementation in epidemiology. Increasing degrees of FAIRness can be achieved by moving data and code from on-site locations to remote, accessible (“Cloud”) data servers, using machine-readable and nonproprietary files, and developing open-source code. Adoption of these practices will improve daily work and collaborative analyses and facilitate compliance with data sharing policies from funders and scientific journals. Achieving a high degree of FAIRness will require funding, training, organizational support, recognition, and incentives for sharing research resources, both data and code. However, these costs are outweighed by the benefits of making research more reproducible, impactful, and equitable by facilitating the reuse of precious research resources by the scientific community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"García-Closas","given":"Montserrat"},{"family":"Ahearn","given":"Thomas U"},{"family":"Gaudet","given":"Mia M"},{"family":"Hurson","given":"Amber N"},{"family":"Balasubramanian","given":"Jeya Balaji"},{"family":"Choudhury","given":"Parichoy Pal"},{"family":"Gerlanc","given":"Nicole M"},{"family":"Patel","given":"Bhaumik"},{"family":"Russ","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Abubakar","given":"Mustapha"},{"family":"Freedman","given":"Neal D"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Wendy S W"},{"family":"Chanock","given":"Stephen J"},{"family":"Berrington de Gonzalez","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Almeida","given":"Jonas S"}],"citation-key":"garcia-closas2023","container-title":"American Journal of Epidemiology","container-title-short":"American Journal of Epidemiology","DOI":"10.1093/aje/kwad040","ISSN":"0002-9262","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,2]]},"page":"995-1005","source":"Silverchair","title":"Moving Toward Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable Practices in Epidemiologic Research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwad040","volume":"192"},

  {"id":"gardin1999","abstract":"Archaeological publications raise problems of many sorts, currently discussed in connection with computer networks and other technologies. One of them, however, seems somewhat neglected, namely the fact that we are mostly unable to read more than a fraction of the articles and books published in our respective fields of research. The substitution of electronic to printed publications does not fully meet that challenge. Complementary measures are needed, taking into account an acknowledged reality: our works are for the most part consulted, not read. The schematisation of archaeological constructs developed in the logicist perspective is meant to facilitate consultations; it is related to the computational paradigm of the information age. As such, however, it fails to fulfil one of the functions of historical works, associated with the narrative mode of thought and discourse. This paper advocates a parallel development of the two genres in archaeology, one through electronic publications of a radically new form, the other through printed works explicitly conceived as literary versions or expansions of the former.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Gardin","given":"J.-C."}],"citation-key":"gardin1999","container-title":"established by: Mauro Cristofani and Riccardo Francovich","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"page":"63–78","source":"Google Scholar","title":"Calcul et narrative dans les publications archéologiques","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.progettocaere.rm.cnr.it/databasegestione/open_oai_page.asp?id=oai:www.progettocaere.rm.cnr.it/databasegestione/A_C_oai_Archive.xml:248"},

  {"id":"gardin2002","abstract":"One of the tasks of cognitive archaeology according to C. RENFREW (1994) is «to use the well-established techniques of rational scientific inquiry, and to aim to develop these […] by explicit theoretical formulations». Such is the purport of the ongoing research program initiated in France in the ’70s on the logicist analysis and computational modelling of archaeological constructs (GARDIN 1979). A first assessment was presented to UISPP Commission 4 in 1990; the present paper describes advances of the program after that date in two directions, theoretical and pratical. 1. On the theoretical side, (a) new light has been shed on the position of the logicist analysis of archaeological papers (irrespective of their subject or denomination) in relation to recent work on natural logic or natural reasoning in the sciences of man; (b) further, the modelling function of the proposed ‘schematisations’ of argument has been brought out in the course of an ongoing debate on the respective part of Models and Narratives in the constitution of knowledge in the social sciences. The constraints to which mathematical models are currently subject are applicable to logico-discursive models as well: the same tests (formal coherence and empirical correspondence) are used to establish the validity of both; (c) lastly, as a logical follow-up of a and b, the case for a ‘séparation des genres’ has been strengthened, i.e. scientific models on the one hand, whether quantitative (mathematical) or qualitative (logicist), and/or imaginative amplifications of their findings on the other, both genres being however regarded as contributions to knowledge in a broad sense (BRUNER 1986). A large part of our discursive constructs belong to an intermediate or hybrid kind which tends to claim a distinct epistemological status, between or above the two genres. Doubt are raised about the future of this perspective in the long run; they found some unexpected support in Paul Ricoeur’s recent plea for a return to a stricter distinction between the cognitive and the rhetorical components in our «writing of history and representations of the past» (RICOEUR 2000). 2. On the pratical side, a new form of archaeological publication has been proposed (ROUX 2000), combining the principles of logicist analysis and new information technology. It consists in reformulating linear discursive constructs as tree-like structures of inference, expressed in computational terms (data base + rewrite formulas), and recording them on an electronic support, CD-ROM or web site, in order to take advantage of the navigational facilities of hypertext. No loss of cognitive substance is incurred in the process; and a partial answer is thereby offered to the ‘reading vs. consultation issue’ now widely acknowledged in scientific research, in the humanities as elsewhere.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Gardin","given":"J.-C."}],"citation-key":"gardin2002","container-title":"Archeologia e Calcolatori","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"page":"19–30","source":"Google Scholar","title":"Les modèles logico-discursifs en archéologie","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://eprints.bice.rm.cnr.it/819/","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"gardin2002b","abstract":"All the products of archaeological research can be regarded as theories in the etymological sense of the word: namely points of view concerning events or ways of life in ancient societies, inferred from the analysis of material remains. This is fairly obvious when archaeologists embark upon explanations of complex historical phenomena about which written texts offer little or no evidence, such as the emergence of agriculture at different times in various parts of the world (the so-called Neolithic revolution), the decline and fall of the Maya empire, etc. Ideas differ regarding the weight of various factors in such phenomena—climatic, economic, demographic, etc. We are clearly dealing then with alternative theories of a complex process; but the same is true of the more modest products of archaeological research. Assigning a function to an object of unknown use, for instance, is a way to “explain” it, from a utilitarian or any other viewpoint (social, religious, magical, etc.). More basically still, the attribution of space and time coordinates to archaeological finds is an inevitable component of any explanation in which those finds play a part. Thus, it is impossible to account for the sudden abundance of coarse hand-made pottery in ancient Hellenistic sites of the Black sea unless we are able to demonstrate first that those unexpected potsherds belonged to the traditional ware of the Scytho-Sarmatian tribes that roamed through Eurasia in the last centuries of the 1st millennium B.C. and eventually mixed or traded with Greek settlers in that area. The generality of this process stands out in the interpretation of iconographical monuments; in order to make sense of prehistoric paintings, for instance, one needs to put forward a number of arguments by analogy which are in fact different ways of looking at the painted caves—in other words, different viewpoints, different theories meant to explain the motivations of prehistoric artists or the destination of their works.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Gardin","given":"Jean-Claude"}],"citation-key":"gardin2002b","collection-title":"Methodos Series","container-title":"The Explanatory Power of Models","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-4020-4676-6_13","ISBN":"978-90-481-6122-5 978-1-4020-4676-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"language":"en","page":"267-284","publisher":"Springer, Dordrecht","source":"link.springer.com","title":"The Logicist Analysis of Explanatory Theories in Archaeology","type":"chapter","URL":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-4676-6_13"},

  {"id":"gardner2021","abstract":"Is the ‘material’ or ‘ontological’ turn a major new paradigm in archaeological theory? Or is it another iteration of the cycle of piecemeal innovation which has created a very fragmented discipline? While there are insights from recent scholarship in this vein which are certainly important, this paper will err toward the latter view. Even though ‘symmetrical’ and other object-agency approaches are still growing in mainstream archaeological debate, much of the source literature upon which they draw has been around for several decades, and accumulated a fair amount of critique. At the very least, therefore, we need to learn from the way the materiality debate is playing out in other sub-fields. Beyond that, I will argue, we should go back to the turn before this one—the practice turn—and explore that road a bit more thoroughly, if we are to find the most useful approaches to develop in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Gardner","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"gardner2021","container-title":"Cambridge Archaeological Journal","DOI":"10.1017/S0959774321000196","ISSN":"0959-7743, 1474-0540","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8]]},"language":"en","page":"503-508","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Taking the Wrong Turn?

  {"id":"garofoli2017","abstract":"Evolutionary cognitive archaeology (ECA) is an emerging discipline that attempts to reconstruct the properties of ancient cognitive systems from the study of the material remains found in the archaeological record. Although there has been substantial interest in this area in recent years, scholars have tended to pay little attention to the methodologies used to formulate their theories. This has fostered an unfortunate situation of incommensurability between competing lines of argument. In this paper, I will attempt to provide a way out of this stagnation, using the methodology of “holistic mapping,” which represents a rational tool for theory validation in ECA. The lack of a shared methodology is a symptom of the wider neglect of deeper epistemological aspects of ECA, which in turn has given rise to the even more problematic questioning of the very foundations of the whole ECA enterprise. The absence of direct access to the ancient mind is associated with barriers to empirical testability, which fosters the production of “just so stories,” therefore evoking the specter of relativism. Building upon the previous methodological considerations, I will attempt to defend the epistemic validity of ECA, by discussing how holistic mapping can lead to the acquisition of reliable knowledge even if the object of science can only be indirectly reconstructed. Firmer epistemological foundations for ECA will be established by contextualizing this methodology within a middle-ground position in archaeological theory defined as “realism.” This epistemological perspective allows rejecting both the narrow empiricism and corrosive relativism currently threatening ECA.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Garofoli","given":"Duilio"}],"citation-key":"garofoli2017","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-016-9308-9","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1150-1176","source":"link-springer-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca","title":"Holistic Mapping: Towards an Epistemological Foundation for Evolutionary Cognitive Archaeology","title-short":"Holistic Mapping","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-016-9308-9","volume":"24"},

The objective is to create automated methods for automatically classifying and successively retrieving photographic data leveraging the current breed of AI methods based on Deep Learning paradigm. In this work, the lack of images to be used for the training of the AI system is addressed by testing an approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for automatically synthesizing unrealistic photos, which, in turn, can be used for training image classification and retrieval systems. Specifically, we propose a method to drive the generation of realistic classical order images using GAN approaches anchored to semantic ontology domain representation. More specifically, the proposed AI leverages the advantages of knowledge-based and data-driven methods and foresees a level image generation: the first one that synthesizes isolated objects corresponding to each ontology concept and the second one that, instead, combines the generated objects according to the spatial information provided by the ontology in order to generate realistic scenes. The resulting images can then be employed to train automated classifiers and more reliable retrieval methods by minimizing the efforts usually required by human operators to manually annotate data. In addition, the proposed generative strategy allows for a deeper understanding of cultural heritage visual data enabling the possibility to enhance design capabilities in simulation contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Garozzo","given":"Raissa"},{"family":"Santagati","given":"Cettina"},{"family":"Spampinato","given":"Concetto"},{"family":"Vecchio","given":"Giuseppe"}],"citation-key":"garozzo2021","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2020.102736","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"102736","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Knowledge-based generative adversarial networks for scene understanding in Cultural Heritage","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X20305277","volume":"35"},

  {"id":"garstki2017","abstract":"As new digital technologies now pervade the discipline of archaeology, the practice of creating digital 3D representations of artifacts has become widespread. The rapid growth and acceptance of these technologies into the discipline leaves us in a position where we must engage with how these tools fit our epistemologies. I propose that we look to a much older technology, photography, to inform the way that these digital artifacts are dealt with as we move into an increasingly digital field. In doing so, I will argue that the creation of a 3D digital artifact is a productive process, just as any form of media used to document and interpret the archaeological record. Through this production, the digital form is decoupled from the original physical artifact. The creation of a new representation of the artifact (in the form of a photograph or digital model) provides a new dimension to our interactions with these artifacts. The result of the digital movement in archaeology is a more interactive experience with artifacts, allowing researchers and the public alike digital access to archaeological collections. If the current trend continues, digital artifact modeling will become as indispensable to archaeology as traditional photography. It is therefore necessary for archaeologists to be aware of the subjectivities and biases that exist during this productive act as we move into a more integrated field of digital, representational technologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Garstki","given":"Kevin"}],"citation-key":"garstki2017","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-016-9285-z","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"726-750","source":"link-springer-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca","title":"Virtual Representation: the Production of 3D Digital Artifacts","title-short":"Virtual Representation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-016-9285-z","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"garstki2022","abstract":"Every part of archaeological practice is intimately tied to digital technologies, but how deeply do we really understand the ways these technologies impact the theoretical trends in archaeology, how these trends affect the adoption of these technologies, or how the use of technology alters our interactions with the human past? This volume suggests a critical approach to archaeology in a digital world, a purposeful and systematic application of digital tools in archaeology. This is a call to pay attention to your digital tools, to be explicit about how you are using them, and to understand how they work and impact your own practice. The chapters in this volume demonstrate how this critical, reflexive approach to archaeology in the digital age can be accomplished, touching on topics that include 3D data, predictive and procedural modelling, digital publishing, digital archiving, public and community engagement, ethics, and global sustainability. The scale and scope of this research demonstrates how necessary it is for all archaeological practitioners to approach this digital age with a critical perspective and to be purposeful in our use of digital technologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Garstki","given":"Kevin"}],"citation-key":"garstki2022","ISBN":"978-1-950446-26-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,1]]},"language":"en","source":"escholarship.org","title":"Critical Archaeology in the Digital Age: Proceedings of the 12th IEMA Visiting Scholar’s Conference.

  {"id":"gavryushkina2021","abstract":"3D digital recording technologies have become increasingly popular for rapid, cost-effective, and accurate archaeological documentation in the field. Despite improvements in 3D GIS software, three-dimensional reconstruction of archaeological stratigraphy has been slow to develop and is rarely utilized as a basis for spatial analysis post-excavation. This is partially owing to the technical and methodological challenges of creating accurate reconstructions of excavated stratigraphy, which restricts the analytical potential of 3D datasets. Volumetric 3D modeling could vastly improve how we understand and analyze archaeological deposits and stratigraphies by enabling a quantitative comparative analysis of per-volume density of artifact types between stratigraphic units. The presented case study examines the spatial articulation of the recorded stratigraphic units from three adjacent trenches excavated during the 2015-2017 field season at the Chalcolithic settlement site of Chlorakas-Palloures in Cyprus. Three vector-based 3D modeling methods using the existing 3D Analyst toolkit within the proprietary software ESRI ArcScene are evaluated for their effectiveness in volumetric representation of stratigraphy using total station (TS) data and photogrammetry models of archaeological features. The results of this study indicate that volumetric modeling can enhance the analytical potential of spatial data by visualizing and identifying patterns in excavated deposits and organizing and disseminating information about the excavation process in an intuitive, user-friendly interface. However, accurate volumetric modeling of all types of archaeological features requires a re-evaluation of conventional documentation procedures to capture the volume of excavated deposits rather than just the interfaces between them. Furthermore, efficient workflows using cost-effective and open source software must be developed to make this approach more accessible and effective for a wider archaeological community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Gavryushkina","given":"Marina"}],"citation-key":"gavryushkina2021","container-title":"Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage","container-title-short":"Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage","DOI":"10.1016/j.daach.2021.e00184","ISSN":"2212-0548","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,2]]},"language":"en","page":"e00184","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The Potential and Problems of Volumetric 3D Modeling in Archaeological Stratigraphic Analysis: A Case Study from Chlorakas-Palloures, Cyprus","title-short":"The Potential and Problems of Volumetric 3D Modeling in Archaeological Stratigraphic Analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212054821000138"},
  {"id":"gaye2014","abstract":"Background: Research in modern biomedicine and social science requires sample sizes so large that they can often only be achieved through a pooled co-analysis of data from several studies. But the pooling of information from individuals in a central database that may be queried by researchers raises important ethico-legal questions and can be controversial. In the UK this has been highlighted by recent debate and controversy relating to the UK’s proposed ‘care.data’ initiative, and these issues reflect important societal and professional concerns about privacy, confidentiality and intellectual property. DataSHIELD provides a novel technological solution that can circumvent some of the most basic challenges in facilitating the access of researchers and other healthcare professionals to individual-level data.Methods: Commands are sent from a central analysis computer (AC) to several data computers (DCs) storing the data to be co-analysed. The data sets are analysed simultaneously but in parallel. The separate parallelized analyses are linked by non-disclosive summary statistics and commands transmitted back and forth between the DCs and the AC. This paper describes the technical implementation of DataSHIELD using a modified R statistical environment linked to an Opal database deployed behind the computer firewall of each DC. Analysis is controlled through a standard R environment at the AC.Results: Based on this Opal/R implementation, DataSHIELD is currently used by the Healthy Obese Project and the Environmental Core Project (BioSHaRE-EU) for the federated analysis of 10 data sets across eight European countries, and this illustrates the opportunities and challenges presented by the DataSHIELD approach.Conclusions: DataSHIELD facilitates important research in settings where: (i) a co-analysis of individual-level data from several studies is scientifically necessary but governance restrictions prohibit the release or sharing of some of the required data, and/or render data access unacceptably slow; (ii) a research group (e.g. in a developing nation) is particularly vulnerable to loss of intellectual property—the researchers want to fully share the information held in their data with national and international collaborators, but do not wish to hand over the physical data themselves; and (iii) a data set is to be included in an individual-level co-analysis but the physical size of the data precludes direct transfer to a new site for analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Gaye","given":"Amadou"},{"family":"Marcon","given":"Yannick"},{"family":"Isaeva","given":"Julia"},{"family":"LaFlamme","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Turner","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Elinor M"},{"family":"Minion","given":"Joel"},{"family":"Boyd","given":"Andrew W"},{"family":"Newby","given":"Christopher J"},{"family":"Nuotio","given":"Marja-Liisa"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Butters","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Murtagh","given":"Barnaby"},{"family":"Demir","given":"Ipek"},{"family":"Doiron","given":"Dany"},{"family":"Giepmans","given":"Lisette"},{"family":"Wallace","given":"Susan E"},{"family":"Budin-Ljøsne","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Oliver Schmidt","given":"Carsten"},{"family":"Boffetta","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Boniol","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Bota","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Carter","given":"Kim W"},{"family":"deKlerk","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Dibben","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Francis","given":"Richard W"},{"family":"Hiekkalinna","given":"Tero"},{"family":"Hveem","given":"Kristian"},{"family":"Kvaløy","given":"Kirsti"},{"family":"Millar","given":"Sean"},{"family":"Perry","given":"Ivan J"},{"family":"Peters","given":"Annette"},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Catherine M"},{"family":"Popham","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Raab","given":"Gillian"},{"family":"Reischl","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Sheehan","given":"Nuala"},{"family":"Waldenberger","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Perola","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Heuvel","given":"Edwin","non-dropping-particle":"van den"},{"family":"Macleod","given":"John"},{"family":"Knoppers","given":"Bartha M"},{"family":"Stolk","given":"Ronald P"},{"family":"Fortier","given":"Isabel"},{"family":"Harris","given":"Jennifer R"},{"family":"Woffenbuttel","given":"Bruce HR"},{"family":"Murtagh","given":"Madeleine J"},{"family":"Ferretti","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Burton","given":"Paul R"}],"citation-key":"gaye2014","container-title":"International Journal of Epidemiology","container-title-short":"International Journal of Epidemiology","DOI":"10.1093/ije/dyu188","ISSN":"0300-5771","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",12,1]]},"page":"1929-1944","source":"Silverchair","title":"DataSHIELD: taking the analysis to the data, not the data to the analysis","title-short":"DataSHIELD","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyu188","volume":"43"},

Our new approach is based on the chemical analysis of biotite inclusions in ceramic bodies using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, and enables us to identify the geological origin of the clay used. Spot analysis of the biotite inclusions contained in ceramics made from clay derived from the alteration of rocks can be linked to the original granitic massif. The thin section or rock analysis of biotite inclusions is relatively fast. The dosage of trace elements, such as lithium and vanadium establishes a filiation between the rocks and ceramics. Using this geochemical base, it is possible to establish a link between a granitic batholite and early ceramics and to propose a circumscribed production area.

  {"id":"gentile2019","abstract":"Weaponry is one of the most widespread categories of metalwork from the European Bronze Age. Different lines of evidence point out that violent encounters and martial values played a significant role both in communities' lives and ideologies. Hence, reconstructing the practices surrounding Bronze Age weaponry is pivotal for the understanding of many aspects of coeval societies. Nevertheless, the study of the functionality and use-life of such items has developed rather late compared to other categories of objects (e.g. flint implements). Currently, experimental archaeology and use-wear analysis concerning metalwork are facing the challenge of leaving the stage of ‘infancy’ to become fully developed fields of study. This paper aims at contributing to such a development by illustrating the potential and the results of an experimental framework for the investigation of combat with bronze weaponry (swords in this paper) which offers a viable compromise between actualism and variable control. We provide an in-depth account of the results by describing both the morphology and the formation mechanics of the features obtained supported by extensive photographic documentation. Furthermore, we discuss our observations regarding the relationship between specific combat movements and the type of marks produced on weapons. Finally, the results of a pilot use-wear study on Bronze Age swords are presented in order to assess the validity of our approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Gentile","given":"V."},{"family":"Gijn","given":"A.","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"gentile2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2019.02.004","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,1]]},"page":"130-143","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Anatomy of a notch.

  {"id":"gero2007","abstract":"In this paper I argue that the practice of archaeology over-emphasizes and over-rewards unambiguous certainty in our interpretations, even though our conclusions are usually drawn from necessarily partial, underdetermined and complex evidence. I argue that full or partial erasure of ambiguity from our data and from our interpretive assertions does not serve the long-term interests of the discipline; that a feminist practice aimed at more nuanced understandings of the past and open to more subtle, multivalenced notions of reality, must accept ambiguity as a central feature of archaeological interpretation. After I review familiar strategies that are used to obscure troubling areas of uncertainty in archaeology, I urge feminist practice to resist employing these “mechanisms of closure” in our work. It is only by openly recognizing and preserving the ambiguity that resides in messy data arrangements today that we stand any hope of fuller and richer understandings in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Gero","given":"Joan M."}],"citation-key":"gero2007","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-007-9037-1","ISSN":"1573-7764","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"311-327","source":"Springer Link","title":"Honoring Ambiguity/Problematizing Certitude","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-007-9037-1","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"gerson1986","abstract":"Every office is an open system, and the products of office work are the result of decentralized negotiations. Changing patterns of task organization and alliance inevitably give rise to inconsistent knowledge bases and procedures. This implies that there are no globally correct answers to problems addressed by OISs. Rather, systems must deal with multiple competing, possibly irreconcilable, solutions. Articulating alternative solutions is the problem of due process. This problem and its consequences are illustrated by a case study of a rate-setting group in a large health insurance firm. There is no formal solution to the problem of due process. But it must be solved in practice if distributed intelligent OISs are to be developed. We propose an alternative approach based on the work of social scientists concerned with analyzing analogous problems in human organization. Solution of the due process problem hinges on developing local closures to the problem faced by an organization. This means analyzing (a) local, tacit knowledge and its transfer ability; (b) articulation work, that is, reconciling incommensurate assumptions and procedures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Gerson","given":"Elihu M."},{"family":"Star","given":"Susan Leigh"}],"citation-key":"gerson1986","container-title":"ACM Transactions on Information Systems","container-title-short":"ACM Trans.

To do this, we offer a constructive analysis, focusing on common methods used in open science, including open materials and data, preregistration, and large sample sizes, and illuminate potential benefits and costs from a feminist science perspective. We also offer some solutions and deeper questions both for individual researchers and the feminist psychology and open science communities.

  {"id":"gheorghiade2023","abstract":"The main objective of this paper is to develop quantitative measures for describing the diversity, homogeneity, and similarity of archaeological data. It presents new approaches to characterize the relationship between archaeological assemblages by utilizing entropy and its related attributes, primarily diversity, and by drawing inspiration from ecology. Our starting premise is that diachronic changes in our data provide a distorted reflection of social processes and that spatial differences in data indicate cultural distancing. To investigate this premise, we adopt a parsimonious approach for comparing assemblage profiles employing and comparing a range of (Hill) diversities, which enable us to exploit different aspects of the data. The modelling is tested on two seemingly large datasets: a Late Bronze Age Cretan dataset with circa 13,700 entries (compiled by PG); and a 4th millennium Western Tripolye dataset with circa 25,000 entries (compiled by AD). The contrast between the strongly geographically and culturally heterogeneous Bronze Age Crete and the strongly homogeneous Western Tripolye culture in the Southern Bug and Dnieper interfluve show the successes and limitations of our approach. Despite the seemingly large size of our datasets, these data highlight limitations that confine their utility to non-semantic analysis. This requires us to consider different ways of treating and aggregating assemblages, either as censuses or samples, contingent upon the degree of representativeness of the data. While our premise, that changes in data reflect societal changes, is supported, it is not definitively confirmed. Consequently, this paper also exemplifies the limitations of large archaeological datasets for such analyses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Gheorghiade","given":"Paula"},{"family":"Vasiliauskaite","given":"Vaiva"},{"family":"Diachenko","given":"Aleksandr"},{"family":"Price","given":"Henry"},{"family":"Evans","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Rivers","given":"Ray"}],"citation-key":"gheorghiade2023","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-023-09627-4","ISSN":"1573-7764","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1109-1141","source":"Springer Link","title":"Entropology: an Information-Theoretic Approach to Understanding Archaeological Data","title-short":"Entropology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-023-09627-4","volume":"30"},

Stages 1 and 2 (2009-13) involve collaboration with the University of Sydney Library eScholarship Repository and archaeologists studying colonial historic places and archaeological sites in New South Wales. So far the project has collected and digitised over 1000 hard-copy reports produced mainly before the mid 1990s that document previously unpublished heritage consultancy projects and student research. This ‘grey literature’ is being archived and content made publicly accessible online. The first version of the current NSW AOL sustainable digital archive was launched in March 2011 at http://nswaol.library.usyd.edu.au. This is designed to support preservation of digital content into the future, despite technology change, and is linked to a website with full-text search functionality and facetted-browsing that provides online access to over 600 PDF versions of digitized hard-copy reports. Stage 2 (2011-3) will archive and make further, and different kinds of, information accessible.

  {"id":"gillings2017","abstract":"Since the widespread adoption of GIS by archaeologists in the early 1990s, analyses of visibility have steadily gained traction, becoming commonplace in landscape and regional analysis. This is in large part due to the routine way in which such products can be generated, bolstered by a raft of landscape-based studies that have placed varying degrees of emphasis upon human perception and direct bodily engagement in seeking to understand and explore the past. Despite this seeming popularity, two worrying trends stand out. The first is the lack of any coherent theoretical framework, applications preferring instead to seek justification in the very first wave of experiential landscape approaches that emerged in the early 1990s. Needless to say, the intervening 20 or so years have seen considerable development in the conceptual tools we draw upon in order to make sense of past landscapes, not to mention considerable finessing of the first-wave developments alluded to above. Second is the tendency to relegate viewshed analysis to certain types of predictable problem or question (i.e. viewshed analysis has become typecast). These trends have been compounded by a host of other issues. For example, whilst there have been refinements, tweaks and variations to the basic viewshed (and the frequency with which they are generated and combined), not to mention establishment of robust calibration criteria for controlling them and statistical approaches for assessing the patterns tendered, these have yet to be brought together in any coherent fashion and their veracity critically assessed. Likewise, a failure to establish an agreed vocabulary has resulted in a number of proverbial wheels being reinvented time and again. The argument presented here is that viewsheds have considerably more to offer archaeology but to realise this entails confronting these issues head on. That this is possible and desirable is illustrated through discussion of a new theoretical framework for visibility-studies that draws upon developments in assemblage theory and the author's own work on affordance and relationality. To demonstrate the value of this approach in encouraging different ways of thinking about what viewsheds are and how we might begin to draw creatively upon them, a case-study is described where viewsheds are folded into a detailed exploration of landscape liminality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Gillings","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"gillings2017","collection-title":"Archaeological GIS Today: Persistent Challenges, Pushing Old Boundaries, and Exploring New Horizons","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2017.05.004","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,1]]},"page":"121-128","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Mapping liminality: Critical frameworks for the GIS-based modelling of visibility","title-short":"Mapping liminality","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440317300675","volume":"84"},

  {"id":"giomi2019","abstract":"The Chaco World, centered on the San Juan Basin of New Mexico, in the Southwestern U.S.A., was organized largely around ritual activities, including the use and deposition of a wide range of rare and unusual objects. The great houses of Chaco Canyon were foundational in the development of these ritual activities. Biographical or assemblage-oriented approaches are well suited to studying ritual behavior and have been successfully applied to understanding religious ritual at Chacoan great houses, especially the site of Pueblo Bonito. While formal network analyses (and traditional statistical analyses) are typically used to evaluate relationships between archaeological sites, we argue that network analysis also has great utility in expanding existing biographical approaches to Chacoan ritual. Applying network methods to a network of general artifact classes (like turquoise or pipes) from different room contexts within Pueblo Bonito helps to understand the co-associations of objects grouped together through common use or deposition, likely in the course of ritual activities. These co-associations help expand our knowledge of ritual behavior within Pueblo Bonito, indicating distinctions between architectural spaces based on specialized ritual practices. This analysis also has important implications for Chacoan social organization, supporting existing arguments for a Chacoan house society model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Giomi","given":"Evan"},{"family":"Peeples","given":"Matthew A."}],"citation-key":"giomi2019","container-title":"Journal of Anthropological Archaeology","container-title-short":"Journal of Anthropological Archaeology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jaa.2018.10.002","ISSN":"0278-4165","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,1]]},"page":"22-31","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Network analysis of intrasite material networks and ritual practice at Pueblo Bonito","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278416518301132","volume":"53"},

But that's just the \"History.\" The \"Theory\" focuses on such 20th-century notables as Claude Shannon, Norbert Wiener, Alan Turing, and others who worked on coding, decoding, and re-coding both the meaning and the myriad messages transmitted via the media of their times. In the \"Flood,\" Gleick explains genetics as biology's mechanism for informational exchange--Is a chicken just an egg's way of making another egg?--and discusses self-replicating memes (ideas as different as earworms and racism) as information's own evolving meta-life forms. Along the way, readers learn about music and quantum mechanics, why forgetting takes work, the meaning of an \"interesting number,\" and why \"[t]he bit is the ultimate unsplittable particle.\" What results is a visceral sense of information's contemporary precedence as a way of understanding the world, a physical/symbolic palimpsest of self-propelled exchange, the universe itself as the ultimate analytical engine. If Borges's \"Library of Babel\" is literature's iconic cautionary tale about the extreme of informational overload, Gleick sees the opposite, the world as an endlessly unfolding opportunity in which \"creatures of the information\" may just recognize themselves. --Jason Kirk","author":[{"family":"Gleick","given":"James"}],"citation-key":"gleick2011","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-0-375-42372-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"publisher":"Pantheon Books","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood","title-short":"The Information","type":"book"},
  {"id":"glencross2017","abstract":"The rapid pace of economic, political, and social change over the past 150 years has framed and reframed archaeological practice in Ontario. Indigenous groups have become increasingly involved in and critical of archaeological research. Indigenous peoples who value archaeological investigation of ancestral sites, but also desire to protect their buried ancestors, have restricted archaeological excavation and the analysis of remains. Over the last decade, research and consulting archaeologists in Ontario, Canada, have worked collaboratively with Indigenous peoples with an eye to developing sustainable archaeology practices. In the spirit of sustainable archaeology, a comprehensive research project and field school run by Wilfrid Laurier University is training the next generation of archaeologists to adopt investigative techniques that minimize disturbance of ancestral sites. Here we present the results of our surface, magnetic susceptibility, and metal detecting surveys of a Huron-Wendat village site, which pose minimally invasive solutions for investigating village sites in wooded areas. The water-sieving of midden soils in an attempt to recover 100 percent of cultural materials, and the analysis of archived collections also honor the values of Indigenous descendant communities by limiting additional invasive excavation.\n, \nLe rythme rapide des changements sociaux, politiques et économiques des dernières cent cinquante années a structuré et restructuré les pratiques archéologiques en Ontario.

  {"id":"goff2019","abstract":"There has been—and continues to be—tension between Native peoples and museums in the United States due to past collecting practices and exhibitions that strive to interpret their culture and history without their involvement. Previously, many of these exhibitions stereotyped and lumped Native peoples together, depicting their cultures as static and interpreting them and their material culture from a Western scientific perspective. Changes are being made. Collaboration between Native peoples and museums in all areas of museum work, including exhibitions, is beginning to be considered by many as a best practice. Exhibitions developed in collaboration with Native peoples, with shared curatorial authority, decidedly help ease the historic tension between the two, and they are much more vibrant and accurate than when collaboration is lacking. This article will provide three examples of collaboration, defined with our tribal partners, to develop exhibitions at History Colorado, the state history museum, concluding with lessons learned., Existen ciertas tensiones, actualmente como también han existido en el pasado, entre poblaciones indígenas por un lado y museos en los Estados Unidos por el otro lado, acerca de las prácticas de adquirir ejemplares de culturas indígenas y de preparer exhibiciones de los mismos, sin involucrar a gente indígena. Las exhibiciones de este tipo en el pasado a menudo eran caracterizadas por observaciones estereotipadas que muchas veces agruparon distintas poblaciones indígenas como que fueron una sola. Además, el material cultural de las exhibiciones era presentado como estático y la interpretación del mismo era exclusivamente de la perspectiva científica occidental. Sin embargo, se ven cambios en la actualidad. Ahora muchos consideran que la colaboración entre comunidades indígenas y museos en todos los ámbitos de trabajo en los museos, incluso el de las exhibiciones, es la práctica o método más recommendable. Las exhibiciones preparadas con comunidades indígenas, en la que se comparte la responsabilidad, ayuda mucho en disminuir la falta de confianza entre los indígenas y las profesionales de los museos. Las exhibiciones colaborativas son más llamativas y correctas que las exhibiciones que carecen de esta colaboración. La ponencia actual proporciona tres ejemplos de colaboración, realizados con nuestros socios indígenas, en exhibiciones en History Colorado, el museo estatal de historia, lo cual concluye con lecciones aprendidas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Goff","given":"Sheila"},{"family":"Chapoose","given":"Betsy"},{"family":"Cook","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Voirol","given":"Shannon"}],"citation-key":"goff2019","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2019.11","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8]]},"language":"en","page":"224-233","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Collaborating Beyond Collections: Engaging Tribes in Museum Exhibits","title-short":"Collaborating Beyond Collections","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/collaborating-beyond-collections-engaging-tribes-in-museum-exhibits/AAD39C5293681134F0FC2E3821F0C8B0","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"gold2021","abstract":"There is growing concern that the innovation system's ability to create wealth and attain social benefit is declining in effectiveness. This article explores the reasons for this decline and suggests a structure, the open science partnership, as one mechanism through which to slow down or reverse this decline. The article examines the empirical literature of the last century to document the decline. This literature suggests that the cost of research and innovation is increasing exponentially, that researcher productivity is declining, and, third, that these two phenomena have led to an overall flat or declining level of innovation productivity. The article then turns to three explanations for the decline – the growing complexity of science, a mismatch of incentives, and a balkanization of knowledge. Finally, the article explores the role that open science partnerships – public-private partnerships based on open access publications, open data and materials, and the avoidance of restrictive forms of intellectual property – can play in increasing the efficiency of the innovation system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Gold","given":"E.

Whenever and wherever the sharing of data, instruments, and research is discussed, planned, done, measured, judged, or regulated, there are powerful claims, visions, and action concerning what makes for facticity, legitimacy, and credibility in both research and politics. From these sites, I argue, we can observe changes to disciplinary and popular understandings of epistemic virtue, or what makes for reliable, factual, or adequately transparent knowledge production. Attention to these sites can also yield important perspectives on the ways that visions of proper research conduct are imbricated with visions of governance.

  {"id":"goldstein2019","abstract":"This paper examines theoretical and methodological approaches to measuring and discussing skill in the archaeological record. Focusing specifically on evaluating skill in lithic production, a case study is presented which quantifies production errors in several assemblages of obsidian blades from early pastoralist sites of the Elmenteitan culture in southern Kenya (c. 3000–1400 BP). Analysis of error frequency through the blade core reduction sequence and relationships between error types suggest that production errors in blade production may relate, in part, to the presence of novices’ practice and learning. Comparison among assemblages shows that sites closer to the primary obsidian quarry site display higher proportions of blade production errors. Communities-of-practice theory is drawn upon to interpret these patterns and to generate hypotheses for how early Elmenteitan producing herders may have structured knowledge transmission related to lithic production. Finally, the paper discusses how lithic learning may have been integrated into broader social systems relating to pastoralist resilience in eastern Africa.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Goldstein","given":"Steven T."}],"citation-key":"goldstein2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-018-9387-x","ISSN":"1573-7764","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"679-713","source":"Springer Link","title":"Knowledge Transmission Through the Lens of Lithic Production: a Case Study from the Pastoral Neolithic of Southern Kenya","title-short":"Knowledge Transmission Through the Lens of Lithic Production","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-018-9387-x","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"golumbia2016","abstract":"Open Access (OA) is the movement to make academic research available without charge, typically via digital networks. Like many cyberlibertarian causes OA is roundly celebrated by advocates from across the political spectrum. Yet like many of those causes, OA’s lack of clear grounding in an identifiable political framework means that it may well not only fail to serve the political goals of some of its supporters, and may in fact work against them. In particular, OA is difficult to reconcile with Marxist accounts of labor, and on its face appears not to advance but to actively mitigate against achievement of Marxist goals for the emancipation of labor. In part this stems from a widespread misunderstanding of Marx’s own attitude toward intellectual work, which to Marx was not categorically different from other forms of labor, though was in danger of becoming so precisely through the denial of the value of the end products of intellectual work. This dynamic is particularly visible in the humanities, where OA advocacy routinely includes disparagement of academic labor, and of the value produced by that labor.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Golumbia","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"golumbia2016","container-title":"Workplace: A Journal for Academic Labor","DOI":"10.14288/workplace.v0i28.186213","ISSN":"1715-0094","issue":"28","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,16]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c)","number":"28","source":"ices.library.ubc.ca","title":"Marxism and Open Access in the Humanities: Turning Academic Labor against Itself","title-short":"Marxism and Open Access in the Humanities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ices.library.ubc.ca/index.php/workplace/article/view/186213"},

Despite this recognition, many researchers fail to share their data and code publicly. This pattern may arise from knowledge barriers about how to archive data and code, concerns about its reuse, and misaligned career incentives. Here, we define, categorize and discuss barriers to data and code sharing that are relevant to many research fields. We explore how real and perceived barriers might be overcome or reframed in the light of the benefits relative to costs. By elucidating these barriers and the contexts in which they arise, we can take steps to mitigate them and align our actions with the goals of open science, both as individual scientists and as a scientific community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Gomes","given":"Dylan G.

  {"id":"gonzalez-perez2023b","abstract":"Argumentation-oriented discourse analysis usually focuses on what is being said and how, following the text under analysis quite literally, and paying little attention to the things in the world to which the text refers. However, to perform argumentation-oriented discourse analysis, one must assume certain conceptualisations by the author in order to interpret and reconstruct propositions and argumentation structures. These conceptualisations are rarely captured as a product of the analysis process. In this chapter, we argue that considering the ontology to which a discourse refers as well as the text itself provides a richer and more useful representation of the discourse and its argumentation structures, facilitates intertextual analysis, and improves understandability of the analysis products. To this end, we propose the notions of ontological proxies and denotations, i.e. the conceptual artefacts that connect elements in the argumentation structure to the associated ontology elements, and the propositional segments that anchor these to the text, respectively.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Gonzalez-Perez","given":"Cesar"}],"citation-key":"gonzalez-perez2023b","collection-title":"Quantitative Archaeology and Archaeological Modelling","container-title":"Discourse and Argumentation in Archaeology: Conceptual and Computational Approaches","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-031-37156-1_5","editor":[{"family":"Gonzalez-Perez","given":"Cesar"},{"family":"Martin-Rodilla","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Pereira-Fariña","given":"Martín"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-031-37156-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"93-114","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"What Archaeological Texts Argue About: Denotations and Ontological Proxies","title-short":"What Archaeological Texts Argue About","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-37156-1_5"},

While conducting ethnoarchaeological research in Spain, Ethiopia and Brazil, I have been faced with the theoretical and practical shortcomings of this field, which is too deeply rooted in modernist concerns and prejudices. I propose a reconsideration of ethnoarchaeology as archaeology tout court – an archaeology of the present – which has to be symmetrical in character. This means that present and past must not be hierarchically conceived – the former in the service of the latter or vice versa – nor strictly separated ontologically, and the relations between humans and things have to be properly problematized.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"González‐Ruibal","given":"Alfredo"}],"citation-key":"gonzalez-ruibal2006","container-title":"Norwegian Archaeological Review","DOI":"10.1080/00293650601030073","ISSN":"0029-3652","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",10,1]]},"page":"110-125","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The Past is Tomorrow.

  {"id":"gonzalez-ruibal2013","abstract":"Archaeology has been an important source of metaphors for some of the key intellectuals of the 20th century: Sigmund Freud, Walter Benjamin, Alois Riegl and Michel Foucault, amongst many others. However, this power has also turned against archaeology, because the discipline has been dealt with perfunctorily as a mere provider of metaphors that other intellectuals have exploited. Scholars from different fields continue to explore areas in which archaeologists have been working for over two centuries, with little or no reference to the discipline. It seems that excavation, stratigraphy or ruins only become important at a trans-disciplinary level when people from outside archaeology pay attention to them and somehow dematerialize them. Meanwhile, archaeologists have been usually more interested in borrowing theories from other fields, rather than in developing the theoretical potential of the same concepts that other thinkers find so useful. The time is ripe for archaeologists to address a wider audience and engage in theoretical debates from a position of equality, not of subalternity. Reclaiming Archaeology explores how archaeology can be useful to rethink modernity’s big issues, and more specifically late modernity (broadly understood as the 20th and 21st centuries). The book contains a series of original essays, not necessarily following the conventional academic rules of archaeological writing or thinking, allowing rhetoric to have its place in disclosing the archaeological. In each of the four sections that constitute this book (method, time, heritage and materiality), the contributors deal with different archaeological tropes, such as excavation, surface/depth, genealogy, ruins, fragments, repressed memories and traces. They criticize their modernist implications and rework them in creative ways, in order to show the power of archaeology not just to understand the past, but also the present.  Reclaiming Archaeology includes essays from a diverse array of archaeologists who have dealt in one way or another with modernity, including scholars from non-Anglophone countries who have approached the issue in original ways during recent years, as well as contributors from other fields who engage in a creative dialogue with archaeology and the work of archaeologists.","citation-key":"gonzalez-ruibal2013","editor":[{"family":"González-Ruibal","given":"Alfredo"}],"ISBN":"978-1-135-08353-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,21]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"392","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Google Books","title":"Reclaiming Archaeology: Beyond the Tropes of Modernity","title-short":"Reclaiming Archaeology","type":"book"},

  {"id":"gonzalez2016","abstract":"The discovery of a rock art site in 2008 by an amateur archaeologist spurred a wave of public interest in archaeology in Maragatería, Spain. As new discoveries took place, alternative archaeological discourses thrived facing the inaction of institutional and academic archaeologists. A long-term study of Maragatería carried out by the author serves to explore the construction of archaeological epistemic authority in a context where various social actors compete for dominance. Gieryn’s notion of ‘boundary-work’ serves to analyse the different strategies employed by academic and institutional archaeologists, amateurs and pseudoarchaeologists to build epistemic authority. This article draws on Latour’s affirmation that the legitimisation of scientific objectivity should rely on ‘trust’ rather than on ‘certainty’. Ethnographic research showed that the more archaeologists attempted to legitimise their authority by reclaiming certainty, the more pseudoarchaeology proliferated. In contrast, the work of amateurs restrained the growth of pseudoarchaeology by creating networks of trust.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"González","given":"Pablo Alonso"}],"citation-key":"gonzalez2016","container-title":"Cultural Sociology","container-title-short":"Cultural Sociology","DOI":"10.1177/1749975516640569","ISSN":"1749-9755, 1749-9763","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12]]},"language":"en","page":"483-501","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Between Certainty and Trust: Boundary-Work and the Construction of Archaeological Epistemic Authority","title-short":"Between Certainty and Trust","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1749975516640569","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"goodwin2013","abstract":"Focusing on a range of features that are central to the constitution of action, this article is an empirically based theoretical contribution to the field of research attempting to understand how human sociality is established and sustained. Human action is intensely, perhaps uniquely, co-operative. Individual actions are constructed by assembling diverse materials, including language structure, prosody, and visible embodied displays. Semiotically charged objects, such as maps, when included within local action, incorporate ways of knowing and acting upon the world that have been inherited from predecessors. New action is built by performing systematic, selective operations on these public configurations of resources. The way in which a single action encompasses different kinds of resources makes possible 1) distinctive forms of co-operative social organization as alternatively positioned actors contribute different kinds of structure to a single shared action (e.g., the talk of a speaker and the silent visible displays of hearer work together to construct a turn-at-talk and the utterance emerging within it); and 2) the accumulation and differentiation through time within local co-operative transformation zones of dense substrates that create a multiplicity of settings for action. Each setting for action must be inhabited by competent members who have mastered the culturally specific practices required to perform the activities that animate the lifeworld of a particular community. Through the progressive development of, and apprenticeship within, diverse epistemic ecologies, communities invest their members with the resources required to understand each other in just the ways that make possible the accomplishment of ongoing, situated action. Human beings inhabit each other's actions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Goodwin","given":"Charles"}],"citation-key":"goodwin2013","collection-title":"Conversation Analytic Studies of Multimodal Interaction","container-title":"Journal of Pragmatics","container-title-short":"Journal of Pragmatics","DOI":"10.1016/j.pragma.2012.09.003","ISSN":"0378-2166","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",1,1]]},"page":"8-23","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The co-operative, transformative organization of human action and knowledge","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216612002317","volume":"46"},

  {"id":"govier2019","abstract":"Philosopher and physicist Karen Barad (2003; 2007; 2012) has brought a new understanding of causality to the academic discourse (agential realism theory). Inspired by this new take on causality, I problematize the argument that archaeologists ‘follow’ materials. I begin by challenging the act of ‘following’ on two counts (causality and universalism), and then consider the work of Malafouris (2008a) – a thinker whose ideas have the potential to remediate this issue through his examination of the ‘in-between’ humans and matter. I argue that, despite offering an inspirational approach to mind–matter relationships, the dialectical relationship he evokes remains problematic from a Baradian perspective as it is still rooted in ‘following’. I suggest that Barad’s agential realism offers a valuable conceptual framework for researchers who are weary of ‘unilateral’ linear causality and keen to move beyond dialectical thinking (Barad 2007, 214).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Govier","given":"Eloise"}],"citation-key":"govier2019","container-title":"Archaeological Dialogues","DOI":"10.1017/s1380203819000047","ISSN":"1380-2038, 1478-2294","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6]]},"language":"en","page":"51-55","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Do you follow?

  {"id":"graesch2009","abstract":"Despite increasing concern with the effects of archaeological data recovery methods on the types and quantity of objects extracted from the material record, archaeologists rarely discuss recovery biases attributable to the most basic excavation procedures. In this study I examine how several factors, including variable artifact identification skills, can affect artifact recovery rates in the field. Data from household-level investigations at the Stó:lō (Coast Salish) village of Welqámex (DiRi 15) are presented to show how interobserver variation can compromise interpretations of past behavior when opportunities for artifact recovery are limited to observations at the excavation unit and single-episode (field-only) sieving. Laboratory sorting of screen residue retained in 3.2-mm (one-eighth-inch) mesh sieves is shown to account for the recovery of as much as 87.5 percent of lithic artifacts and nearly 90 percent of archaeofaunal remains. Rates of artifact recovery in the field are highly variable among excavation crews working at Welqámex, and I argue that the application of correction factors is inappropriate unless the magnitude of recovery bias can be measured for specific excavation teams and particular depositional contexts. The results of this study further highlight the importance of documenting and mitigating the unintended effects of methodological decisions on archaeological assemblages.\n, \nRésumé\nA despecho del aumento en la preocupación con los efectos de la recuperación de datos con métodos arqueológicos en los tipos y cantidad de objetos extractados de la anotación material, arqueólogos rara vez discuten los sesgos en recuperación atribuidos a los procedimientos más básicos de excavación. En éste estudio examino cómo varios factores, incluyendo variación en las habilidades para identificar artefactos, pueden afectar la razón de artefactos recuperados en el campo. Datos de investigaciones al raso doméstico en la aldea Stó:lō (Coast Salish) de Welqámex (DiRi 15) son destacados para mostrar cómo variación en habilidad puede comprometer interpretaciones de un comportamiento pasado cuando la oportunidad para recuperar artefactos es limitada a observaciones en la unidad de excavación y un solo (campo únicamente) acontecimiento de harnero. En el laboratorio, separación de residuo retenido en cedazos de 3.2-mm (un octavo de pulgada) cuenta por la recuperación de hasta 87.5 por ciento de artefactos líticos y casi el 90 por ciento de restos de fauna arqueológicas. La razón de artefactos recuperados en el campo se ha presentado altamente variable entre equipos excavadores, y así arguyo que la aplicación de factores rectificadores es inadecuada menos que el impacto del sesgo en recuperación sea específicamente medida para equipos excavadores y los contextos particulares que producen depósitos. Los resultados de este estudio marcan adicionalmente la importancia de documentar y aminorar los efectos inadvertidamente causadas por las decisiones metodológicas en colecciones arqueológicas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Graesch","given":"Anthony P."}],"citation-key":"graesch2009","container-title":"American Antiquity","DOI":"10.1017/s0002731600049040","ISSN":"0002-7316, 2325-5064","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",10]]},"language":"en","page":"759-779","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Fieldworker Experience and Single-Episode Screening as Sources of Data Recovery Bias in Archaeology: A Case Study from the Central Pacific Northwest Coast","title-short":"Fieldworker Experience and Single-Episode Screening as Sources of Data Recovery Bias in Archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/fieldworker-experience-and-singleepisode-screening-as-sources-of-data-recovery-bias-in-archaeology-a-case-study-from-the-central-pacific-northwest-coast/BADF14F94F83B16E54855C2E3514DB1E","volume":"74"},

  {"id":"graham2015a","abstract":"When we find an archaeological network, how can we explore the necessary versus contingent processes at play in the formation of that archaeological network? Given a set of circumstances or processes, what other possible network shapes could have emerged? This is the problem of equifinality, where many different means could potentially arrive at the same end result: the networks that we observe. This paper outlines how agent-based modelling can be used as a laboratory for exploring different processes of archaeological network formation. We begin by describing our best guess about how the (ancient) world worked, given our target materials (here, the networks of production and patronage surrounding the Roman brick industry in the hinterland of Rome). We then develop an agent-based model of the Roman extractive economy which generates different kinds of networks under various assumptions about how that economy works. The rules of the simulation are built upon the work of Bang (2006; 2008) who describes a model of the Roman economy which he calls the ‘imperial Bazaar’. The agents are allowed to interact, and the investigators compare the kinds of networks this description generates over an entire landscape of economic possibilities. By rigorously exploring this landscape, and comparing the resultant networks with those observed in the archaeological materials, the investigators will be able to employ the principle of equifinality to work out the representativeness of the archaeological network and thus the underlying processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Graham","given":"Shawn"},{"family":"Weingart","given":"Scott"}],"citation-key":"graham2015a","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-014-9230-y","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"248-274","source":"link.springer.com","title":"The Equifinality of Archaeological Networks: an Agent-Based Exploratory Lab Approach","title-short":"The Equifinality of Archaeological Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-014-9230-y","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"graham2022","abstract":"In the summer of 2021, a video on TikTok was heavily reposted across a variety of social media platforms (attracting conventional media attention too). Unusually (for TikTok), it was about the trade in human remains. Thus, we were presented with the opportunity to watch how knowledge of the trade exploded into broader public consciousness on a comparatively newer platform. In this article, we scrape TikTok for reactions to that moment. In our previous research on the human remains trade on Instagram, we used a particular suite of digital humanities methods to understand how Instagram was being used by participants in the trade. Here, we employ those same methods to develop a case study for contrast. The original individual, whose TikTok account is used to promote his bricks-and-mortar business buying and selling human remains, has, as a result of this attention, gained an even greater number of followers and views, making the video a “success.” Nevertheless, several users engaged in long discussions in the comments concerning the ethics of what this individual is doing. A number of users created videos to criticize his activities, discussing the moral, ethical, and legal issues surrounding the trade in human remains, which in many ways makes the “success” of this video one of fostering opposition and a wider understanding of the ethical and moral issues around this trade.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Graham","given":"Shawn"},{"family":"Huffer","given":"Damien"},{"family":"Simons","given":"Jaime"}],"citation-key":"graham2022","container-title":"Open Archaeology","DOI":"10.1515/opar-2022-0235","ISSN":"2300-6560","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,1]]},"language":"en","license":"De Gruyter expressly reserves the right to use all content for commercial text and data mining within the meaning of Section 44b of the German Copyright Act.","page":"196-219","publisher":"De Gruyter Open Access","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"When TikTok Discovered the Human Remains Trade: A Case Study","title-short":"When TikTok Discovered the Human Remains Trade","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opar-2022-0235/html?lang=en","volume":"8"},

His work and that of his students and colleagues examined multiple, inter-connected aspects of ceramic variability linked to a variety of social, technological, functional, and economic processes.

The Research Information Network (RIN) report, To share or not to share: Publication and quality assurance of research data outputs (June 2008), investigates whether or not researchers make their research data available to others and the issues they encounter when doing so. Importantly, it seeks to do this by seeking the perspectives of researchers themselves. This paper reflects on how this relates to the more top-down literature on the subject. The discussion of the significance of the RIN's main findings is correlated to the four themes of the RIN report. Firstly, it discusses some distinctions in the types of data that should be shared and preserved and what needs to done to do so effectively. Secondly, it reflects on the motivations for and constraints on researchers publishing their data, and how funders and publishers can address them. Thirdly, it reviews some issues around how data are discovered, accessed and re-used.

  {"id":"grillo2019","abstract":"Although archaeology has become increasingly concerned with engaging diverse publics, and has embraced the internet as a means of facilitating such engagement, attitudes towards Wikipedia have—understandably—been more ambivalent. Nevertheless, we argue here, Wikipedia's popularity and reach mean that archaeologists should actively engage with the website by adding and improving archaeological content. One way to do this is in the classroom: this paper provides a detailed how-to for instructors interested in having students create new Wikipedia content. We provide a case study in Wikipedia engagement from an advanced undergraduate course on African Archaeology, assess a program (Wiki Education) designed to help, and suggest further avenues for future outreach. We conclude that Wikipedia's utopian mission aligns with many of the goals of public archaeology, and argue that archaeology has much to gain by engaging with—rather than ignoring or even shunning—Wikipedia., Aunque la arqueología se preocupe cada vez más por comprometerse con públicos diversos, y aunque se haya acogido a la red como medio que pueda facilitar tal compromiso, la disciplina sigue – por razones comprensibles – ambivalente hacia el rol de Wikipedia.

Un sitio donde se puede realizar tal compromiso es el aula: aquí se proveen instrucciones detalladas por los instructores que se interesan en involucrar a sus estudiantes en la creación y/o mejora de contenido para Wikipedia. Discutimos un caso práctico de este tipo de trabajo con Wikipedia desarrollado en un curso bachiller avanzado en arqueología africana. Por este medio, evaluamos un programa (Wiki Education) diseñado para apoyar tales esfuerzos, y sugerimos otras posibilidades para este compromiso.

  {"id":"grimaud2019","abstract":"Three-dimensional representation is now commonly used in archaeological studies of ancient structures and objects, and, a fortiori, in studies of the neolithic monumental funeral architecture of Western France. This research relies on mastering several scales of representation: engravings and the materials that are engraved, architecture, topography and the geographical area. However, the datasets produced by techniques such as LiDAR, photogrammetry, laser scans, and even structured-light 3D scans are very dense and difficult to process, and information cannot be extracted from them easily. Further, such documents are used for many purposes, some of which are contradictory: the same digital repository is used for research (for it allows for a maximal amount of information to be obtained), for communication (by producing lightweight representations for real-time display that are visually attractive to site visitors), and for the preservation of images of objects in their current states, along with information about the relations among datasets for future reference (which implies using file formats suitable for long-term retention to ensure that documents can be accessed in the future). This article seeks to present a functional workflow that integrates acquisition, processing, documentation, distribution and guidelines for archiving 3D archaeological data, with a workflow based almost exclusively on free and open-source software. To this end, the authors begin by considering the relationships among three-dimensional datasets, surveying and the documentation of historical sites and artifacts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Grimaud","given":"Valentin"},{"family":"Cassen","given":"Serge"}],"citation-key":"grimaud2019","container-title":"Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage","container-title-short":"Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage","DOI":"10.1016/j.daach.2019.e00096","ISSN":"2212-0548","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,1]]},"page":"e00096","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Implementing a protocol for employing three-dimensional representations in archaeology (PETRA) for the documentation of neolithic funeral architecture in Western France","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212054818300444","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"grimstead2017","abstract":"Since initial applications of strontium isotope human sourcing in the early 1990s, the use of the method has steadily increased in archaeology and in anthropology more broadly. Despite this trend, the collection of necessary baseline environmental data has not been standardized and sometimes does not occur at all. A thorough environmental sampling strategy will ensure that all the variability within a selected region is documented, which is a critical step to improving the accuracy of sourcing studies. Furthermore, shared strontium baseline data collections are needed to improve the intercomparability of datasets and results. This paper provides a case study from a semiarid region in northwestern New Mexico, USA, highlighting the need for a bottom-up approach to baseline data collection (from bedrock to animal) and describes the methods of pre-field planning and collecting, including rationales for what samples to collect for Sr isotope baseline data. The authors hope that this paper will lay a foundation for the implementation and standardization of Sr isotope baseline data collecting, which does not currently exist.\n, \nDesde las primeras aplicaciones del estudio de isótopos de estroncio para determinar la procedencia de restos humanos en la década de 1990, el uso de este método ha incrementado de manera constante en la arqueología y la antropología en general. A pesar de tal aumento, la colección de datos ambientales de referencia no ha sido estandarizada y a veces no ocurre. Una estrategia de muestreo ambiental exhaustiva garantiza que se documente toda la variabilidad dentro de una región, lo que es un paso crítico para mejorar la precisión de los estudios de procedencia. Además, es necesario mantener bases de datos de referencia compartidas para mejorar la comparabilidad de datos y resultados. En este artículo se presenta un estudio de caso desde la zona semiárida del noroeste de Nuevo México, EE.UU., donde se destaca la necesidad de un enfoque ascendente a la colección de datos de referencia, desde la roca madre hacia los animales. También se describen los métodos para la planificación pre-campo y la recolección de datos. Se describe el uso conjunto de las muestras de estroncio, oxígeno y carbono, y los factores que se deben considerar en la selección de muestras de referencia.

  {"id":"gruber2011","abstract":"This paper describes the ongoing efforts of the authors to present ancient Greek and Roman numismatic data on the public internet, with an emphasis on efforts to integrate information from multiple sources using Linked Data and Semantic Web techniques. By way of very modern metaphor, it is useful to think of coins as intentionally created packages of 'named entities'. Each coin was struck by a particular authority, often at a known site, and coins often make reference to familiar concepts such as deities, historical events, or symbols that were widely recognized in the ancient world. The institutions represented among the authors have deployed search interfaces that allow users to take advantage of this aspect of numismatic databases. The American Numismatic Society's database provides faceted search to its collection of over 550,000 objects. The Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) in the UK presents individual finds (and hoards) recorded throughout the country. The R&ouml;misch-Germanische Kommission and the University of Frankfurt (DBIS) are developing a prototype metaportal (INTERFACE) that accesses national databases of coin finds held in in Frankfurt, Vienna and Utrecht. Each of these resources is beginning to explore Semantic Web/Linked data approaches so that the role of numismatic standards is immediately coming to the fore. DBIS and INTERFACE are developing a numismatic ontology. At the ANS and PAS, the public database already presents RDF serializations based on Dublin Core. Together, the authors have begun to explore standardization of conceptual names on the basis of the vocabulary presented at the site http://nomisma.org . Nomisma.org is a collaborative effort to provide stable digital representations of numismatic concepts and entities. It provides URIs for such basic concepts as 'coin', 'mint', 'axis'. All of these are defined within the scope of numismatics but are already being linked to other stable resources where available. This is particularly the case for mints. For example, the URI http://nomisma.org/id/corinth is intended to represent that ancient city in its role as a minter/issuer of coins. The URI is linked via the SKOS ontology to the&nbsp; Pleiades Gazetteer of ancient places. This allows Nomisma to be the basis for a common representation of the concept that an object is a coin minted at Corinth. The ANS has already deployed such relationships in its public database. The work of all these projects is very much in progress so that this paper hopes to generate discussion on how multiple large projects can move forward in their own work while encouraging sufficient commonality to support large scale research questions undertaken by diverse audiences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Gruber","given":"Ethan"},{"family":"Heath","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Meadows","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Pett","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Tolle","given":"Karsten"},{"family":"Wigg-Wolf","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"gruber2011","container-title":"CAA 2012","event-title":"CAA 2012","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",12,17]]},"language":"en","source":"www.ocs.soton.ac.uk","title":"Semantic Web Technologies Applied to Numismatic Collections","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://www.ocs.soton.ac.uk/index.php/CAA/2012/paper/view/707"},
  {"id":"gualandi2021","abstract":"In the last ten years, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been applied in archaeology. The ArchAIDE project realised an AI-based application to recognise archaeological pottery. Pottery is of paramount importance for understanding archaeological contexts. However, recognition of ceramics is still a manual, time-consuming activity, reliant on analogue catalogues. The project developed two complementary machine-learning tools to propose identifications based on images captured on-site, for optimising and economising this process, while retaining key decision points necessary to create trusted results. One method relies on the shape of a potsherd; the other is based on decorative features. For the shape-based recognition, a novel deep-learning architecture was employed, integrating shape information from points along the inner and outer profile of a sherd. The decoration classifier is based on relatively standard architectures used in image recognition. In both cases, training the algorithms meant facing challenges related to real-world archaeological data: the scarcity of labelled data; extreme imbalance between instances of different categories; and the need to take note of minute differentiating features. Finally, the creation of a desktop and mobile application that integrates the AI classifiers provides an easy-to-use interface for pottery classification and storing pottery data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Gualandi","given":"Maria Letizia"},{"family":"Gattiglia","given":"Gabriele"},{"family":"Anichini","given":"Francesca"}],"citation-key":"gualandi2021","container-title":"Heritage","container-title-short":"Heritage","DOI":"10.3390/heritage4010008","ISSN":"2571-9408","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,13]]},"language":"en","page":"140-159","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An Open System for Collection and Automatic Recognition of Pottery through Neural Network Algorithms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2571-9408/4/1/8","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"guarino1995","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to defend the systematic introduction of formal ontological principles in the current practice of knowledge engineering, to explore the various relationships between ontology and knowledge representation, and to present the recent trends in this promising research area. According to the \"modelling view\" of knowledge acquisition proposed by Clancey, the modelling activity must establish a correspondence between a knowledge base and two separate subsystems: the agent's behaviour (i.e. the problem-solving expertise) and its own environment (the problem domain ). Current knowledge modelling methodologies tend to focus on the former sub-system only, viewing domain knowledge as strongly dependent on the particular task at hand: in fact, AI researchers seem to have been much more interested in the nature of reasoning rather than in the nature of the real world. Recently, however, the potential value of task-independent knowledge bases (or \"ontologies\") suitable to large scale integration has been underlined in many ways. In this paper, we compare the dichotomy between reasoning and representation to the philosophical distinction between epistemology and ontology. We introduce the notion of the ontological level, intermediate between the epistemological and the conceptual levels discussed by Brachman, as a way to characterize a knowledge representation formalism taking into account the intended meaning of its primitives. We then discuss some formal ontologic distinctions which may play an important role for such purpose.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Guarino","given":"Nicola"}],"citation-key":"guarino1995","container-title":"International Journal of Human-Computer Studies","container-title-short":"International Journal of Human-Computer Studies","DOI":"10.1006/ijhc.1995.1066","ISSN":"1071-5819","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995",11,1]]},"page":"625-640","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Formal ontology, conceptual analysis and knowledge representation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S107158198571066X","volume":"43"},

The most radical difference is perhaps between the philosophical sense, which has of course a well-established tradition, and the computational sense, which emerged in the recent years in the knowledge engineering community, starting from an early informal definition of (computational) ontologies as “explicit specifications of conceptualizations”.

  {"id":"gugora2018","abstract":"Between 2005 and 2009, 125 skeletons were excavated from the medieval (13th century CE) Hungarian archaeological site of Solt-Tételhegy. While previous stable isotopic research has examined the diet of medieval European peoples, here we present the first such research conducted on a medieval Hungarian population. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses were conducted on dental enamel and dentin from first and second molars from 24 individuals to reconstruct their childhood diet, as well as from the rib bones of 21 of the same individuals to reconstruct their adulthood diet. The average enamel δ13C values is −11.1‰, and the average for dentin δ13C values is 17.4‰. The bone apatite δ13C values have a mean of −10‰, while the bone collagen δ13C values have a mean of −17.1‰. These data suggest that C3 plants were the dominant plant type consumed by the majority of the study population, although varying quantities of C4 plants were also eaten, supporting other archaeological evidence that C3 plants were consumed more often than C4 plants in medieval Europe. The dentin δ15N values average at 10.6‰, and the bone δ15N values average at 9.8‰, showing that animal protein constituted a moderate proportion of the diet. Despite signs of status differences indicated by burial location, stable nitrogen isotope values also suggest that the individuals had relatively egalitarian access to animal protein.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Gugora","given":"Ariana"},{"family":"Dupras","given":"Tosha L."},{"family":"Fóthi","given":"Erzsébet"}],"citation-key":"gugora2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2017.12.036","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,1]]},"page":"151-160","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Pre-dating paprika: Reconstructing childhood and adulthood diet at medieval (13th century CE) Solt-Tételhegy, Hungary from stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses","title-short":"Pre-dating paprika","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X17304340","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"guilfoyle2015","abstract":"Collaborative archaeology is a growing field within the discipline, albeit one that is rarely analyzed. Although collaborative approaches are varied and diverse, we argue that they can all share a single methodological framework. Moreover, we suggest that collaborative archaeology projects can be evaluated to determine the variety among projects and to identify the elements of engaged research. We provide two case studies emphasizing project evaluation: (1) inter-project evaluation of community-engagement in British Columbia archaeology and (2) intra-project evaluation of co-management archaeology projects in Western Australia. The two case studies highlight that project evaluation is possible and that a single framework can be applied to many different types of projects. Collaborative archaeology requires analysis and evaluation to determine what facilitates engagement to further the discipline and to create better connections between archaeologists and community members. The discussed case studies illustrate two shared methods for accomplishing this. The paper argues that collaborative approaches are necessary for advancing archaeological practice.\n, \nLa arqueología colaborativa es un área de estudio que se ha desarrollado dentro de esta disciplina, no obstante los limitados análisis que existen en torno a ella.

  {"id":"gupta2017","abstract":"Archaeologists are often considered frontrunners in employing spatial approaches within the social sciences and humanities, including geospatial technologies such as geographic information systems (GIS) that are now routinely used in archaeology. Since the late 1980s, GIS has mainly been used to support data collection and management as well as spatial analysis and modeling. While fruitful, these efforts have arguably neglected the potential contribution of advanced visualization methods to the generation of broader archaeological knowledge. This paper reviews the use of GIS in archaeology from a geographic visualization (geovisual) perspective and examines how these methods can broaden the scope of archaeological research in an era of more user-friendly cyber-infrastructures. Like most computational databases, GIS do not easily support temporal data. This limitation is particularly problematic in archaeology because processes and events are best understood in space and time. To deal with such shortcomings in existing tools, archaeologists often end up having to reduce the diversity and complexity of archaeological phenomena. Recent developments in geographic visualization begin to address some of these issues and are pertinent in the globalized world as archaeologists amass vast new bodies of georeferenced information and work towards integrating them with traditional archaeological data. Greater effort in developing geovisualization and geovisual analytics appropriate for archaeological data can create opportunities to visualize, navigate, and assess different sources of information within the larger archaeological community, thus enhancing possibilities for collaborative research and new forms of critical inquiry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Gupta","given":"Neha"},{"family":"Devillers","given":"Rodolphe"}],"citation-key":"gupta2017","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-016-9298-7","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"852-885","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Geographic Visualization in Archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-016-9298-7","volume":"24"},

These compilations of data are at the interface of data management and data visualization. Yet issues of data governance such as the nature, management, quality, ownership, security, and accessibility of archaeological spatial databases are under examined in archaeology, a situation that can affect data intensive methods and “big” data approaches. Data governance including laws and policies associated with data have bearing on archaeological practices which, in turn, can impact map visualizations and subsequent decision-making. With the growth of the geospatial web and Web 2.0 technologies, there are increasing opportunities for archaeologists and the general public to collect and engage with digital archaeological data. In Canada, greater numbers of specialists from different sectors (research and education, government, private companies) now accumulate, store, and process digital archaeological data. We draw from the OCAP® (ownership, control, access, possession) principles to shed light on data governance in archaeology, with a focus on archaeological spatial databases in Canadian archaeology. In this context, we draw attention to the rights of Indigenous peoples, the legal and policy issues associated with archaeological spatial databases, and a need for greater engagement with Indigenous data governance principles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Gupta","given":"Neha"},{"family":"Blair","given":"Sue"},{"family":"Nicholas","given":"Ramona"}],"citation-key":"gupta2020","container-title":"Journal of Field Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00934690.2020.1713969","ISSN":"0093-4690","issue":"sup1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,20]]},"page":"S39-S50","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"What We See, What We Don’t See: Data Governance, Archaeological Spatial Databases and the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in an Age of Big Data","title-short":"What We See, What We Don’t See","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00934690.2020.1713969","volume":"45"},

  {"id":"gupta2023","abstract":"Reuse and sharing of archaeological data are tied to ethics in data practice, research design, and the rights of Indigenous peoples in decision-making about their heritage. In this article, the authors discuss how the CARE (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics) principles and Indigenous data governance create intellectual space for archaeological research. We show how archaeologists can use this framework to highlight hidden costs and labor associated with the “data ecosystem,” which are often borne by Indigenous nations and communities. The CARE framework gives voice to Indigenous peoples’ concerns around data sharing, curation, and reuse; ways we can redress these issues; and strategies that facilitate Indigenous nations and communities in deriving collective benefit from research. In archaeology, these efforts include greater work on heritage legislation and policy, repositioning Indigenous peoples as active stewards of their data, and building capacity in digital methods and ethical data practice. Each Indigenous nation and community has its own interests, values, and protocols, and we suggest paths to bring data practice into alignment with the CARE framework.\n, \nLa reutilización y el intercambio de datos arqueológicos están vinculados a la ética en la práctica de datos, el diseño de la investigación y los derechos de los pueblos indígenas en la toma de decisiones sobre su patrimonio.

  {"id":"gutierrez-rodriguez2018","abstract":"Geoarchaeology, as a significant discipline within archaeology and the geosciences, operates at many different scales and encompasses several analytical methods and techniques, including what we highlight here: (archaeological) soil micromorphology. Communication practices of micromorphological researchers have not evolved significantly or, at least, at the same rate as archaeology as a whole, which has recently experienced an explosion of technological applications related to documentation. This paper aims to explore and illustrate a new methodological proposal for thin section digitalization and for the presentation of micromorphological data in scientific articles. We started from a premise: micromorphology should be a discipline based on images, since they provide the essential data of micromorphological observation and inference. The proposal combines existing tools and techniques, as well as those from other disciplines, to increase the standard quality of images used in scientific publications and produce dynamic and contextualized illustrations of research results in micromorphology. The final goal of the workflow is to provide keys and tools that allow researchers, as producers of information, to present their data in a more effective, contextualized and informative way as article enrichments or linked illustrations in their papers. To illustrate the procedure, we use two samples from different archaeological contexts: the Palaeolithic site of Roc de Marsal (France) and the Roman city of Baelo Claudia (Spain). The benefits of this proposal are multiple: a) access and objectivity to raw research data, b) improvement in the interaction among micromorphologists, c) spreading of the informative potential of micromorphology to the research community, and, finally, d) making the reader an active participant in the information. Although there are different eligible ways of image scanning and data sharing, the combination of gigapixel thin sections and article enrichments define a step forward in communicating research results and sharing raw data, an opportunity that should be fostered and not be missed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Gutiérrez-Rodríguez","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Toscano","given":"Maurizio"},{"family":"Goldberg","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"gutierrez-rodriguez2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2018.05.025","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,1]]},"page":"565-575","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"High-resolution dynamic illustrations in soil micromorphology: A proposal for presenting and sharing primary research data in publication","title-short":"High-resolution dynamic illustrations in soil micromorphology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18301251","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"haak2018","abstract":"An evaluator's task is to connect the dots between program goals and its outcomes. This can be accomplished through surveys, research, and interviews, and is frequently performed post hoc. Research evaluation is hampered by a lack of data that clearly connect a research program with its outcomes and, in particular, by ambiguity about who has participated in the program and what contributions they have made. Manually making these connections is very labor-intensive, and algorithmic matching introduces errors and assumptions that can distort results. In this paper, we discuss the use of identifiers in research evaluation—for individuals, their contributions, and the organizations that sponsor them and fund their work. Global identifier systems are uniquely positioned to capture global mobility and collaboration. By leveraging connections between local infrastructures and global information resources, evaluators can map data sources that were previously either unavailable or prohibitively labor-intensive. We describe how identifiers, such as ORCID iDs and DOIs, are being embedded in research workflows across science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics; how this is affecting data availability for evaluation purposes: and provide examples of evaluations that are leveraging identifiers. We also discuss the importance of provenance and preservation in establishing confidence in the reliability and trustworthiness of data and relationships, and in the long-term availability of metadata describing objects and their inter-relationships. We conclude with a discussion on opportunities and risks for the use of identifiers in evaluation processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Haak","given":"Laurel L."},{"family":"Meadows","given":"Alice"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Josh"}],"citation-key":"haak2018","container-title":"Frontiers in Research Metrics and Analytics","DOI":"10.3389/frma.2018.00028","ISSN":"2504-0537","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Using ORCID, DOI, and Other Open Identifiers in Research Evaluation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frma.2018.00028","volume":"3"},

Following an overview of collaborative mapping and its current state in today‘s increasingly online and digital world, four potential modes are introduced through which collaborative mapping in archaeology can be carried out: psychogeography, local community involvement, an online archaeology map system and spatial narratives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Hacıgüzeller","given":"Piraye"}],"citation-key":"haciguzeller2017","container-title":"Digital Classics Online","DOI":"10.11588/dco.2017.0.35670","ISSN":"2364-7957","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,2]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2017","page":"5-16","source":"journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de","title":"Collaborative Mapping in the Age of Ubiquitous Internet: An Archaeological Perspective","title-short":"Collaborative Mapping in the Age of Ubiquitous Internet","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/dco/article/view/35670"},

  {"id":"haciguzeller2021","abstract":"While the epistemological affordances and varied impacts of different media on archaeological knowledge production have been scrutinized by many practitioners in recent decades, sources of digital structured data (e.g., spreadsheets, traditional relational databases, content management systems) have seen far less critical enquiry. Structured digital data are often venerated for their capacities to facilitate interoperability, equitable data exchange, democratic forms of engagement with, and widespread reuse of archaeological records, yet their constraints on our knowledge formation processes are arguably profound and deserving of detailed interrogation. In this article, we discuss what we call the emerging supremacy of structured digital data in archaeology and seek to question the consequences of their ubiquity. We ground our argument in a case study of a range of texts produced by practitioners working on the Çatalhöyük Research Project. We attempt to map short excerpts from these texts to structured data via the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model. This exercise allows making preliminary observations about the representational affordances and resistances of texts (which can be considered as a type of semi- or unstructured data) and structured data. Ultimately, we argue that the push to create more and more structured and structurable data needs to be tempered by a more inclusive digital practice in archaeology that protects difference, incommensurability, and interpretative nuance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Hacıgüzeller","given":"Piraye"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"James Stuart"},{"family":"Perry","given":"Sara"}],"citation-key":"haciguzeller2021","container-title":"Open Archaeology","DOI":"10.1515/opar-2020-0220","ISSN":"2300-6560","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1709-1730","publisher":"De Gruyter Open Access","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"On the Emerging Supremacy of Structured Digital Data in Archaeology: A Preliminary Assessment of Information, Knowledge and Wisdom Left Behind","title-short":"On the Emerging Supremacy of Structured Digital Data in Archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opar-2020-0220/html","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"hacking2004a","abstract":"With the unusual clarity, distinctive and engaging style, and penetrating insight that have drawn such a wide range of readers to his work, Ian Hacking here offers his reflections on the philosophical uses of history. The focus of this volume, which collects both recent and now-classic essays, is the historical emergence of concepts and objects, through new uses of words and sentences in specific settings, and new patterns or styles of reasoning within those sentences. In its lucid and thoroughgoing look at the historical dimension of concepts, the book is at once a systematic formulation of Hacking's approach and its relation to other types of intellectual history, and a valuable contribution to philosophical understanding. Hacking opens the volume with an extended meditation on the philosophical significance of history. The importance of Michel Foucault--for the development of this theme, and for Hacking's own work in intellectual history--emerges in the following chapters, which place Hacking's classic essays on Foucault within the wider context of general reflections on historical methodology. Against this background, Hacking then develops ideas about how language, styles of reasoning, and \"psychological\" phenomena figure in the articulation of concepts--and in the very prospect of doing philosophy as historical ontology.","author":[{"family":"Hacking","given":"Ian"}],"citation-key":"hacking2004a","ISBN":"978-0-674-01607-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"292","publisher":"Harvard University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Historical Ontology","type":"book"},
  {"id":"hacking2015","abstract":"The trajectory of objectivity, as an idea, is the triumph of bumbling public good sense over great but bad European philosophy (Descartes, Kant). The public in question is primarily that of querulous western democracies as they entered the age of technocracy, and it did a good if unplanned job of dealing with novelty. It is often hard to be objective in the face of a real-life debate, but there is no problem about objectivity itself—except what is foisted on it by highbrow idealization and misguided polemics. The adjective “objective” does the work for the abstract noun, “objectivity”, but in a negative way: in any single situation, one or more of the host of ways to fail to be objective is what matters. Objectivity is not a virtue: it is the proclaimed absence of this or that vice. When public virtues compete—evidence-based versus clinical medicine, for example—we need to think harder, not more objectively. When objectivity is declared to be the cardinal virtue of science, it at once gets bashed (rightly)—or else abused (deservedly), as in “NAOS: The National Association for Objectivity in Science” (q.v.). So let’s get down to work on cases, not generalities.","author":[{"family":"Hacking","given":"Ian"}],"citation-key":"hacking2015","container-title":"Objectivity in Science","editor":[{"family":"Tsou","given":"Jonathan Y."},{"family":"Richardson","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Padovani","given":"Flavia"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"19-33","publisher":"Springer Verlag","source":"PhilPapers","title":"Let’s Not Talk About Objectivity","type":"chapter"},

To date, no examples of this practice are available for the Near East during this timeframe. This contribution presents three human teeth from Neolithic Çatalhöyük (Central Anatolia, Turkey; 7100–6000 cal BC) that appear to have been modified for use as pendants. Macroscopic, microscopic and radiographic analyses confirm the modification and use of two out of three of these finds. The two confirmed pendants were likely extracted from the skeletonised remains of mature and old adults, carefully drilled, and worn for a variable period of time. The rarity of such artefacts in the prehistoric Near East suggests a profound symbolic meaning for this practice and these objects, and provides new insights into the funerary customs and symbolic importance of the use of human body parts during the Neolithic of the Near East.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Haddow","given":"Scott D."},{"family":"Tsoraki","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Vasić","given":"Milena"},{"family":"Dori","given":"Irene"},{"family":"Knüsel","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Milella","given":"Marco"}],"citation-key":"haddow2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.102058","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"102058","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"An analysis of modified human teeth at Neolithic Çatalhöyük, Turkey","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X19304894","volume":"28"},

Overviews of archaeological sites and analyses of assemblages and contexts explore how new forms of data; methods of data recovery and analysis; and sampling strategies have affected the discourse in classical archaeology and the range of research questions and strategies at our disposal. Recent excavations and field practices are steering the way that we approach Greek cultural landscapes and form broader theoretical perspectives, while generating new research questions and interpretive frameworks that in turn affect how we sample sites, collect and study material remains, and ultimately construct the archaeological record. The book confronts the implications of an integrated dialogue between realms of data and interpretive methodologies, addressing how reengagement with the site, assemblage, or artifact, from the excavation context can structure the way that we link archaeological and systemic contexts in classical archaeology.","author":[{"family":"Haggis","given":"Donald"},{"family":"Antonaccio","given":"Carla"}],"citation-key":"haggis2015","ISBN":"978-1-934078-47-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",5,19]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"440","publisher":"Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG","source":"Google Books","title":"Classical Archaeology in Context: Theory and Practice in Excavation in the Greek World","title-short":"Classical Archaeology in Context","type":"book"},

As a result, above-average engagement rates with few impressions were observed. Compared with that, status updates focusing on actual fieldwork and other research activities gain high numbers of impressions with below-average engagement rates.

This bears both striking similarities and significant differences to the big data paradigm and – as such – offers the potential to do big data analytics differently. This offers value to those already working with big data – for whom the difficulties of making useful and sustainable claims about the social are increasingly apparent – and to sociologists, offering a mode of practice that might shape big data analytics for the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Halford","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Savage","given":"Mike"}],"citation-key":"halford2017","container-title":"Sociology","container-title-short":"Sociology","DOI":"10.1177/0038038517698639","ISSN":"0038-0385","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1132-1148","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Speaking Sociologically with Big Data: Symphonic Social Science and the Future for Big Data Research","title-short":"Speaking Sociologically with Big Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0038038517698639","volume":"51"},
  {"id":"hall1968","abstract":"Virtually everything that man is and does is associated with space. Man's sense of space is a synthesis of many sensory inputs: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory, and thermal. Not only does each of these constitute a complex system (as for example, the dozen or more different ways of experiencing depth visually), but each is molded and patterned by culture. Hence people reared in different cultures live in different sensory worlds. What is more, they are generally unaware of the degree to which the worlds may differ. From the study of culture we learn that the patterning of perceptual worlds is a function not only of the specific culture but of the relationship, activity, and emotions present in a given situation. Therefore, when two people of different cultures interact, each uses different criteria to interpret the other's behavior, and each may easily misinterpret the relationship, the activity, or the emotions involved. The study of culture in the proxemic sense is the study of peoples' use of their perceptual apparatus in different emotional states during different activities, in different relationships, settings, and contexts. No single research technique is sufficient in scope to investigate this complex, multi-dimensional subject. The research technique is, therefore, a function of the particular facet under examination at the time and many call for the involvement of many disciplines. Like all basic studies of the communicative process, proxemics, as I think of it, is more concerned with how than why, and more concerned with structure than content. The work is admittedly detailed and is apt to be routine. It addresses itself to basic human situations in an area of culture that is ordinarily hidden from conscious awareness. For this reason, proxemics frequently leads to new insights about specific cultures, as well as to insights into the generalized concept of culture itself. In formulating my thinking concerning proxemics, I have maintained that culture is an extension of basic biological processes. While man's extensions as they evolve may mask the underlying relationships which maintain the equilibrium of biological systems, the relationships and systems are no less real by virtue of being hidden. In the words of Ian McHarg (1963): ...no species can exist without an environment, no species can exist in an environment of its exclusive creation, no species can survive, save as a nondisruptive member of an ecological community. Every member must adjust to other members of the community and to the environment in order to survive. Man is not excluded from this test.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Hall","given":"Edward T."},{"family":"Birdwhistell","given":"Ray L."},{"family":"Bock","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"Bohannan","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Diebold","given":"","suffix":"A.

  {"id":"hamilakis2009","abstract":"In this introductory essay to this volume, we chart and survey an emerging field, that of archaeological ethnography. We show its links and associations with both disciplinary and social-political trends in archaeology and in social anthropology in the last decades, and discuss some of the key recent work that has been carried out under this rubric. We argue that archaeological ethnography needs to be defined broadly, as a trans-disciplinary and transcultural space that enables researchers and diverse publics to engage in various conversations, exchanges, and interventions. Material traces from various times are at the centre of this emerging space. The production of his space requires a radical rethinking of the ontological and epistemological basis of archaeology, questioning the modernist roots of official archaeologies, and demonstrating the existence of other, public discourses, practices and engagements with the material past which can be defined as alternative archaeologies. Archaeological ethnography can bring to the fore these alternative engagements without necessarily endorsing their premises, being constantly alert to their political connotations and renderings. The main interconnected facets of archaeological ethnography as we propose it here are its critical reflexivity, its holistic and multi-sited nature, its multi-temporal rather than presentist character, its sensuous and sensory engagement with the world, its political commitment, and its conception as collective and team practice, which transcends the boundaries between the researcher and his or her diverse publics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Hamilakis","given":"Yannis"},{"family":"Anagnostopoulos","given":"Aris"}],"citation-key":"hamilakis2009","container-title":"Public Archaeology","DOI":"10.1179/175355309X457150","ISSN":"1465-5187","issue":"2-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",8,1]]},"page":"65-87","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"What is Archaeological Ethnography?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1179/175355309X457150","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"hamilakis2011","abstract":"Archaeology and anthropology, despite their commonalities, have had a rather asymmetrical relationship, and the periodic attempts at closer collaboration resulted in mutual frustration. As both disciplines have recently undergone significant changes, however, with anthropology embracing more fully materiality and historicity, and archaeology engaging in contemporary research, often involving ethnography, the time is ripe for a new rapprochement. Archaeological ethnography, an emerging transdisciplinary field, offers such an opportunity. Archaeological ethnography is defined here as a transcultural space for multiple encounters, conversations, and interventions, involving researchers from various disciplines and diverse publics, and centered around materiality and temporality. It is multitemporal rather than presentist, and although many of its concerns to date are about clashes over heritage, this article argues that its potential is far greater because it can dislodge the certainties of conventional archaeology and question its ontological principles, such as those founded on modernist, linear, and successive temporality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Hamilakis","given":"Yannis"}],"citation-key":"hamilakis2011","container-title":"Annual Review of Anthropology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-anthro-081309-145732","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"page":"399-414","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Archaeological Ethnography: A Multitemporal Meeting Ground for Archaeology and Anthropology","title-short":"Archaeological Ethnography","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-anthro-081309-145732","volume":"40"},
  {"id":"hamilakis2015","abstract":"The recent (2008- present) crisis of financial capitalism is having an enormous impact on the lives of working people all over the world, but it has also hit the largest sector of archaeological activity which has been called commercial archaeology, or contract or developer-funded archaeology. Despite its detrimental effects, the situation has provided an opening for a radical rethinking and reflection on the underlying assumptions of this sector, its ethical and political premises, its long-term viability, and more importantly, the need for alternatives. Within this context, this paper aims to show that the logic of capital was embedded in the process of the constitution of modernist archaeology, right from the start. It also demonstrates the highly problematic operation of commercial archaeology for archaeologists, material culture, and the vast majority of the public. It proposes that what it needs to change radically is the foundational logic of modernist archaeology which makes it part of the framework of capital: its fetishization of things, and their treatment as autonomous objects, divorced from the relationships, flows and connections that have led to their constitution. The paper concludes by outlining briefly an alter-modern archaeology that resides in the in-between spaces, rather than on objectified, reified, and thus easily commodified entities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Hamilakis","given":"Yannis"}],"citation-key":"hamilakis2015","container-title":"International Journal of Historical Archaeology","container-title-short":"Int J Histor Archaeol","DOI":"10.1007/s10761-015-0307-4","ISSN":"1573-7748","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"721-735","source":"Springer Link","title":"Archaeology and the Logic of Capital: Pulling the Emergency Break","title-short":"Archaeology and the Logic of Capital","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10761-015-0307-4","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"hamilton2019","abstract":"North America was initially colonized by humans during the late Pleistocene, and over the course of the Holocene material culture diversified as local populations adapted to regional environments. However, to date, while anthropologists and archaeologists have long been interested in diversity, little is known of the process of diversification over space and time. Here, we focus on the diversification of the archaeological record of western North America over 13,000 years. By compiling time series of projectile point types and their spatial distribution, we quantify the empirical record of diversification in this region. Our results show that projectile point diversity increases exponentially over time, consistent with a simple evolutionary branching process. The spatial extent of projectile points decreases exponentially over time at a similar rate. Therefore, the evolutionary diversification of projectile point types in western North America is a fractal-like space-filling process, likely reflecting increasingly localized adaptations to regional environments and a consequent reduction in the spatial extent of cultural networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Hamilton","given":"Marcus J."},{"family":"Buchanan","given":"Briggs"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Robert S."}],"citation-key":"hamilton2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.01.029","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"page":"486-495","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Spatiotemporal diversification of projectile point types in western North America over 13,000 years","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18305650","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"hammer2019","abstract":"Recently declassified photographs taken by U2 spy planes in the 1950s and 1960s provide an important new source of historical aerial imagery useful for Eurasian archaeology. Like other sources of historical imagery, U2 photos provide a window into the past, before modern agriculture and development destroyed many archaeological sites. U2 imagery is older and in many cases higher resolution than CORONA spy satellite imagery, the other major source of historical imagery for Eurasia, and thus can expand the range of archaeological sites and features that can be studied from an aerial perspective. However, there are significant barriers to finding and retrieving U2 imagery of particular locales, and archaeologists have thus not yet widely used it. In this article, we aim to reduce these barriers by describing the U2 photo dataset and how to access it. We also provide the first spatial index of U2 photos for the Middle East. A brief discussion of archaeological case studies drawn from U2 imagery illustrates its merits and limitations. These case studies include investigations of prehistoric mass-kill hunting traps in eastern Jordan, irrigation systems of the first millennium BC Neo-Assyrian Empire in northern Iraq, and twentieth-century marsh communities in southern Iraq., Las fotografías tomadas por aviones espía U-2 durante los años 50 y 60, recientemente desclasificadas, son una nueva fuente de imágenes aéreas muy útil para la arqueología euroasiática. Tal como otras fuentes de imágenes históricas, las fotografías de los U-2 son una ventana hacia un pasado antes de la destrucción de muchos sitios arqueológicos a manos de la agricultura y el desarrollo modernos. Las imágenes de los U-2 preceden aquellas tomadas por los satélites espía CORONA, la otra fuente principal de imágenes históricas de Eurasia, y en muchos casos son de más alta resolución. Por lo mismo, expanden el rango de sitios y rasgos arqueológicos que se pueden estudiar desde una perspectiva aérea. Sin embargo, existen obstáculos significativos para conseguir y acceder a imágenes de localidades particulares, y por lo tanto los arqueólogos todavía no acostumbran a valerse de ellas. En este artículo tenemos como meta disminuir estos obstáculos a través de una descripción del conjunto de imágenes de los U-2 y de un método para acceder a ellas. También proveemos el primer índice espacial de fotografías de los U-2 del Medio Oriente. Una breve discusión de casos prácticos usando estas imágenes demuestra sus ventajas y limitaciones. Estos casos incluyen investigaciones de trampas de caza prehistóricas en el este de Jordania, sistemas de irrigación del imperio Neo-asirio del primer milenio a.C. en el norte de Irak y de comunidades del siglo XX que habitaban en los humedales del sur de Irak.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Hammer","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Ur","given":"Jason"}],"citation-key":"hammer2019","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2018.38","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5]]},"language":"en","page":"107-126","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Near Eastern Landscapes and Declassified U2 Aerial Imagery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/near-eastern-landscapes-and-declassified-u2-aerial-imagery/A16A04FB4990B74B9FF750DCCF31A141","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"hammersley2010","abstract":"Audio- and video-recordings are the major sources of data in qualitative research today. There is now a substantial literature about the task of transcribing these recordings, though this mainly relates to socio-linguistic and discourse analysis. In general, this takes the view that transcripts construct the talk or action that they portray rather than reproducing what is given. In this article I argue that while this is true in important respects, in that many decisions are involved in producing transcripts, there is also an important sense in which both the strict transcription of words used and the descriptions of speakers’ behaviour are aimed at capturing something that exists independently of the transcription process. ‘Construction’ and ‘givenness’ are both metaphors and we must take care not to be misled by either of them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hammersley","given":"Martyn"}],"citation-key":"hammersley2010","container-title":"Qualitative Research","container-title-short":"Qualitative Research","DOI":"10.1177/1468794110375230","ISSN":"1468-7941","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"553-569","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Reproducing or constructing?

We also assess peer review and editorial decision-making in relation to author gender, finding no evidence of bias and, using the 2020 data, we look for any potential gendered impact of Covid-19, finding solo female authors may have been more affected than those working in teams.

  {"id":"hansen2019","abstract":"In the mid-1980s, the Anthropology Division of the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) began the creation of digital resources as a means of collections access. Much of the database work was a secondary component of projects funded by outside grants and driven by new accountability mandates. The ongoing upgrading process was sporadic in its progress, but it still accomplished the primary goals of improved housing for collections and an exhaustive database. This paper discusses how the historical complications of the data, the scale of the database, its irregular schedule of funding, and deadline-driven projects resulted in inconsistency in data and difficulty in use. Although the examples provided will be specific to the AMNH Anthropology database, the circumstances and issues are common to many databases and the approaches presented broadly applicable. The discussion includes the practices used to mitigate the negative impact of these problems and the way the Division is positioning itself for the future, even as the database continues to provide unprecedented public and institutional access to and utility for the AMNH Anthropology collections., A mediados de la década de 1980, la División de Antropología del Museo Americano de Historia Natural comenzó la creación de recursos digitales como medio de acceso a las colecciones.

  {"id":"hara2003","abstract":"Collaboration is often a critical aspect of scientific research, which is dominated by complex problems, rapidly changing technology, dynamic growth of knowledge, and highly specialized areas of expertise. An individual scientist can seldom provide all of the expertise and resources necessary to address complex research problems. This paper describes collaboration among a group of scientists, and considers how their experiences are socially shaped. The scientists were members of a newly formed distributed, multi-disciplinary academic research center that was organized into four multi-disciplinary research groups. Each group had 14 to 34 members, including faculty, postdoctoral fellows and students, at four geographically dispersed universities. To investigate challenges that emerge in establishing scientific collaboration, data were collected about members' previous and current collaborative experiences, perceptions regarding collaboration, and work practices during the center's first year of operation. The data for the study includes interviews with members of the center, observations of videoconferences and meetings, and a center-wide sociometric survey. Data analysis has led to the development of a framework that identifies forms of collaboration that emerged among scientists (e.g., complementary and integrative collaboration) and associated factors, which influenced collaboration including personal compatibility, work connections, incentives, and infrastructure. These results may inform the specification of social and organizational practices, which are needed to establish collaboration in distributed, multi-disciplinary research centers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hara","given":"Noriko"},{"family":"Solomon","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Seung-Lye"},{"family":"Sonnenwald","given":"Diane H."}],"citation-key":"hara2003","container-title":"Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology","container-title-short":"J.

At once a social reality and a science fiction, the cyborg--a hybrid of organism and machine--represents transgressed boundaries and intense fusions of the nature/culture split. By providing an escape from rigid dualisms, the cyborg exists in a post-gender world, and as such holds immense possibilities for modern feminists.

Using the modern analogue technique, this paper reconstructs temperature, precipitation, and growing degree-day trends in Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania from a set of 20 pollen cores in order to explicate the regional impact of the 6.0–5.0ka BP rapid climate change interval observed in the GISP2 K+ glacio-chemical sequence. Results are compared against a model of regional demographic development covering the time span of 6000–3000BCE. This study indicates that, while macro-scale trends are discernible in Eastern Europe, climatic instability during the fourth millennium BCE was regionally variable and resultant demographic responses were highly targeted and heterogeneous in nature. A period of cooling ca. 3825–3650calBCE resulted in the fracturing of Eneolithic complexes in Romania and generally spurred adaptation to more mobile systems of settlement and subsistence. However, a contemporaneous alternative response involved large-scale migrations to peripheral regions, including the establishment of the Tripolye giant-settlements in Central Ukraine. The methods used illustrate the need for obtaining more proximate confirmation when applying large-scale climate processes to explanations of local and regional archaeological contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Harper","given":"Thomas K."}],"citation-key":"harper2017","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2017.06.010","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,20]]},"source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Demography and climate in Late Eneolithic Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania: Multiproxy evidence and pollen-based regional corroboration","title-short":"Demography and climate in Late Eneolithic Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X17302547"},

  {"id":"harrison2011","abstract":"AbstractThis paper explores a central paradox in the aims of the archaeology of the contemporary past as they have been articulated by its practitioners. On the one hand, its aim has been expressed as one of making the familiar ‘unfamiliar’, of distancing the observer from their own material world; a work of alienation. On the other hand, it has also aimed to make the past more accessible and egalitarian; to recover lost, subaltern voices and in this way to close the distance between past and present. I suggest that this paradox has stymied its development and promoted a culture of self-justification for a subfield which has already become well established within archaeology over the course of three decades. I argue that this paradox arises from archaeology's relationship with modernity and the past itself, as a result of its investment in the modernist trope of archaeology-as-excavation and the idea of a past which is buried and hidden. One way of overcoming this paradox would be to emphasize an alternative trope of archaeology-as-surface-survey and a process of assembling/reassembling, and indeed to shift away from the idea of an ‘archaeology of the contemporary past’ to speak instead of an archaeology ‘in and of the present’. This would reorient archaeology so that it is seen primarily as a creative engagement with the present and only subsequently as a consideration of the intervention of traces of the past within it. It is only by doing this that archaeology will develop into a discipline which can successfully address itself to the present and future concerns of contemporary societies. Such a move not only has implications for archaeologies of the present and recent past, but concerns the very nature and practice of archaeology as a discipline in its broadest sense in the 21st century.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Harrison","given":"Rodney"}],"citation-key":"harrison2011","container-title":"Archaeological Dialogues","DOI":"10.1017/S1380203811000195","ISSN":"1478-2294, 1380-2038","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",12]]},"page":"141-161","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Surface assemblages.

Yet, the characterization of ceramic variations and their meaning receives little attention in the archaeological study. In the present research, we wished to monitor small-scale variations, searching for the unique signature of the individual potter during production. We thus examined new parameters for distinguishing between trainee potters and monitoring their distinct styles as part of an integrated experimental archaeological study. For the purposes of this research, ceramic students were instructed to produce the same part of a storage jar repeatedly for several days following a strict protocol—with a single prototype and using the same technique in the same workspace. All the produced items were 3-D scanned to extract accurate geometric parameters for classification. Cluster analysis was used to analyze the digital data, in addition to a novel data visualization technique that was developed for detecting ceramic variations. These methods enabled us to distinguish the potters by their individual styles, probably already established in the early stages of learning. Our results show that the novel visualization approach, together with the quantitative method, allows us to efficiently identify the location, on the vessels, of the potters' stylistic fingerprint.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Harush","given":"Ortal"},{"family":"Glauber","given":"Naama"},{"family":"Zoran","given":"Amit"},{"family":"Grosman","given":"Leore"}],"citation-key":"harush2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2019.104973","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,1]]},"page":"104973","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"On quantifying and visualizing the potter's personal style","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440319300627","volume":"108"},

  {"id":"hassan2019","abstract":"Tree-ring dating involves matching sequences of ring widths from undated timbers to dated sequences known as ‘master’ chronologies. Conventionally, the undated timbers (from a building or woodland) are sequentially matched against one another, using t-tests to identify the relative offsets with the ‘best’ match, thus producing a ’site’ chronology. A date estimate is obtained when this is matched to a local master chronology of known calendar age. Many tree-ring sequences in the UK produce rather low t-values and are thus declared not to have a ‘best’ match to a master chronology. Motivated by this and the routine use of Bayesian statistical methods to provide a probabilistic approach to radiocarbon dating, this paper investigates the practicality of Bayesian dendrochronology. We explore a previously published model for the relationship between ring widths and the underlying climatic signal, implementing it within the Bayesian framework via a simulation-based approach. Probabilities for a match at each offset are produced, removing the need to identify a single ‘best’ match. The Bayesian model proves successful at matching in both simulated and real examples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Hassan","given":"M.

  {"id":"hauptmann2016","abstract":"Abstract We report on the texture, phase content and on the making of Late Bronze Age copper oxhide ingots as excavated from the shipwreck of Uluburun. This type of ingot represented the “world market” bulk metal in the Mediterranean and beyond. The ingots are characterized by a high porosity, by inclusions of slag fragments and cuprite which result from casting raw copper smelted before from ores. The ingots were cast from several batches of copper. The shape of the oxhide ingots was never fully understood, and the way of casting was uncertain due to the absence of casting moulds. It is the aim of this paper to discuss the making of these ingots. We will present an alternative model on how to cast such ingots using four crucibles. The experiments will show that the texture of the ingots is created by gases such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide and water vapour. The high porosity is shown to be advantageous for breaking the ingots into fragments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Hauptmann","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Laschimke","given":"Ralf"},{"family":"Burger","given":"Maria"}],"citation-key":"hauptmann2016","container-title":"Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences","container-title-short":"Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences","DOI":"10.1007/s12520-015-0255-2","ISSN":"1866-9557","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"751-761","source":"Scholars Portal Journals","title":"On the making of copper oxhide ingots: evidence from metallography and casting experiments","title-short":"On the making of copper oxhide ingots","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.scholarsportal.info/detailsundefined","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"hawkins2003","abstract":"In case studies of enumerated survey data from Cyprus and Egypt, it is possible to attribute interobserver variation in the detection of lithic findspots and recovery of lithics to sources of bias. The reliability of data on the presence and density of lithic scatters depends on careful evaluation, but straightforward evaluation depends on thoughtful research design. In well-designed strategies, testing for bias is straightforward but, when certain classes of data are not available, it may be impossible to determine whether variation in the apparent density of artifacts is simply a function of who collected where. We present alternatives for evaluation of survey results and presentation of survey data, including exhaustion maps and corrected density maps.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Hawkins","given":"A.

BC) account for about 18%, or some 10,000 artefacts, of the chipped stone assemblage. Obsidian is one of the few non-local materials at Domuztepe and as well as being used to make tools it is also used to make items of jewellery, mirrors, bowls and axe-like objects. We know from the geochemical analysis of a relatively small number of artefacts that the obsidian was imported from eight different and widely separated sources in Central, NE and SE Anatolia. These sources are between 200 and 900km distant from Domuztepe.\n\nAll these factors suggest that obsidian was valued not only as a raw material for tool manufacture but also as a material from which to make luxury items. As an exotic material it is also likely to have a key role in forging and maintaining social and economic relationships, both within the site and more widely. Understanding of the origins of the obsidians and the form in which they were obtained, worked and used, context by context, is key to this. However, difficulties arise with provenancing such a large assemblage, not least because conventional geo-chemical methods are unfeasibly expensive. This article documents the approaches we have developed to overcome this problem.","author":[{"family":"Healey","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Campbell","given":"Stuart"}],"citation-key":"healey2009","container-title":"Internet Archaeology","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"title":"The Challenge of Characterising Large Assemblages of Exotic Materials: a case study of the obsidian from Domuztepe, SE Turkey","type":"article-journal","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"heath-stout2020","abstract":"Field schools are essential for undergraduate students pursuing careers in archaeology, but they are expensive and, consequently, inaccessible to many. Although there have been efforts to rectify this through the creation of scholarships, there have been no systematic studies of the full cost of archaeological field schools. Here, we present a study of 208 field schools from 2019, including their tuition, room and board, and airfare, as well as the wages that students may lose by participating in them rather than working. We also explore how archaeologists interviewed for Heath-Stout's dissertation study of diversity issues in the discipline have navigated finding field experiences. We argue that scholarships are an ineffective and insufficient means of promoting equity and accessibility in the field because the root of the problem lies in institutionalized inequality and exclusivity. We provide strategies that students and faculty can use to address these problems on both individual and systemic levels. By making field schools affordable and accessible to a more diverse set of undergraduate students, we can create a more just and inclusive discipline., Las escuelas de campo son esenciales para los estudiantes universitarios en arqueología, pero son muy caras y por tanto inaccesibles para muchos de ellos. Aunque hay iniciativas para solucionar este problema mediante la creación de becas, no se ha realizado ningún estudio sistemático sobre los costos completos de estas escuelas de campo. En este artículo presentamos un análisis de 208 programas del año 2019, teniendo en cuenta sus matrículas, costos de alojamiento y comida, costos de transporte aéreo y los salarios que los estudiantes dejan de ganar por participar en vez de trabajar. También exploramos cómo los arqueólogos entrevistados para la tesis de Heath-Stout (un estudio sobre la diversidad en la disciplina) han navegado la búsqueda de experiencias de trabajo de campo. Sostenemos que las becas son un instrumento ineficaz e insuficiente para promover la equidad y la accesibilidad en la disciplina porque las raíces del problema son la desigualdad y la exclusividad institucionalizadas. Ofrecemos estrategias que pueden ser utilizadas por los estudiantes y profesores para abordar estos problemas tanto a nivel individual como sistémico.

  {"id":"heath-stout2023","abstract":"Since Gero’s (1985) germinal article on gender inequities in archaeology, feminist archaeologists have theorized that research processes are gendered: fieldwork is masculine-coded, and lab and museum work are feminine-coded. Goldstein and colleagues (2018) revealed that while more men submit grant applications to the National Science Foundation (NSF) overall, both men and women submit more post-Ph.D. proposals for field-based than for lab-based projects. This paper expands on these data by presenting an analysis of NSF-funded project abstracts (1955–2020) focusing on 1) methods employed, 2) primary regions where research is conducted, and 3) genders and organizational affiliations of principal investigators. We demonstrate that in this dataset, the gendered lab/field divide is not statistically significant; however, there are significant correlations between the genders of PIs and the regions they study. We conclude that the gendering of archaeological methods is in flux but that inequities and gendered patterns continue to shape archaeological research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Heath-Stout","given":"Laura E."},{"family":"Jalbert","given":"Catherine L."}],"citation-key":"heath-stout2023","container-title":"Journal of Field Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00934690.2022.2154999","ISSN":"0093-4690","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,17]]},"page":"102-112","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Funding in the “Field:” An Analysis of Demographics and Methods in National Science Foundation Archaeology Grants (1955–2020)","title-short":"Funding in the “Field","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00934690.2022.2154999","volume":"48"},

The goal of this paper is to develop some of the tools to conceptualize this complementary integration between agents and artifacts. It does so by proposing a multidimensional framework, including the dimensions of information flow, reliability, durability, trust, procedural transparency, informational transparency, individualization, and transformation. The proposed dimensions are all matters of degree and jointly they constitute a multidimensional space in which situated cognitive systems can be located and have certain dimensional configurations. These dimensions provide a new perspective on the conditions for cognitive extension. They are, however, not meant to provide a set of necessary and sufficient conditions, but to provide a toolbox for investigating the degree and nature of the integration of agent and artifact into “new systemic wholes”. The higher a situated system scores on the proposed dimensions, the more functional integration occurs, and the more tightly coupled the system is.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Heersmink","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"heersmink2015","container-title":"Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences","container-title-short":"Phenom Cogn Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s11097-014-9355-1","ISSN":"1572-8676","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"577-598","source":"Springer Link","title":"Dimensions of integration in embedded and extended cognitive systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11097-014-9355-1","volume":"14"},

Five institutions participated in this study, using nine tube-based instruments of seven types. A set of 12 reference materials not used for calibration was analysed according to the protocol. The results show an improvement in reproducibility of between 65% and 83%, depending on the element, in comparison with a similar study carried out in 2010. The protocol allowed the consistent reporting of concentrations for 15 elements, in contrast to only eight elements that were reported in the 2010 study. Finally, the protocol was shown to generate accurate quantitative results with a well-characterized precision. It is hoped the information presented here can help researchers studying heritage copper alloys to collaborate more effectively and with greater confidence in the reproducibility of their results.

  {"id":"hegmon2003","abstract":"Theory in North American archaeology is characterized in terms of foci and approaches manifested in research issues, rather than in explicit or oppositional theoretical positions. While there are some clear-cut theoretical perspectives—evolutionary ecology, behavioral archaeology, and Darwinian archaeology—a large majority of North American archaeology fits a broad category here called “processual-plus.” Among the major themes that crosscut many or all of the approaches are interests in gender, agency/practice, symbols and meaning, material culture, and native perspectives. Gender archaeology is paradigmatic of processual-plus archaeology, in that it draws on a diversity of theoretical approaches to address a common issue. Emphasis on agency and practice is an important development, though conceptions of agency are too often linked to Western ideas of individuals and motivation. The vast majority of North American archaeology, including postprocessual approaches, is modern, not postmodern, in orientation. The relative dearth of theoretical argument positively contributes to diversity and dialogue, but it also may cause North American theory to receive inadequate attention and unfortunate misunderstandings of postmodernism.\n          , \n            Résumé\n            La teoría en la arqueología de Norte América está caracterizada en términos de enfoques y consideraciones manifestados en problemáticas de investigación, más que en posiciones teóricas explícitas u opuestas. En tanto que hay algunas perspectivas teóricas definidas—ecología evolucionaria, arqueología del comportamiento, y arqueología Darviniana—la gran mayoría de la arqueología de Norte América encaja en una categoría amplia que aquí se denomina como “procesual-plus.” Entre los temas principales que entrecruzan muchos o todos los enfoques están los que se interesan en el género, en el organismo o en la práctica, el que se centra en los símbolos y significados, el enfocado en la cultura material, y en las perspectivas indígenas. La arqueología de género es paradigmá tica de la arqueología procesual-plus, en la medida en que se extiende en la diversidad de enfoques teóricos para atender a una problemática común. El énfasis en el organismo y la práctica es un desarrollo importante, aunque las concepciones sobre el agente son vinculadas con mucha frecuencia a las ideas occidentals de individuos y de motivación. La gran mayoría de la arqueología de Norte América, incluyendo el enfoque postprocesual, es moderno, pero no postmoderno, en orientación. La relativa escasez de argumentos teó ricos contribuye positivamente a la diversidad y al diálogo, pero también puede causar a la teoría Norteamericana el recibir una atención inadecuada y puede llevar desafortunadamente a malentender el postmodernismo.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Hegmon","given":"Michelle"}],"citation-key":"hegmon2003","container-title":"American Antiquity","container-title-short":"Am. antiq.","DOI":"10.2307/3557078","ISSN":"0002-7316, 2325-5064","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",4]]},"language":"en","page":"213-243","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Setting Theoretical Egos Aside: Issues and Theory in North American Archaeology","title-short":"Setting Theoretical Egos Aside","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0002731600048344/type/journal_article","volume":"68"},
  {"id":"hegmon2017","abstract":"Archaeologists’ newfound ability to access vast digital collections creates opportunities but also presents challenges when those collections are from varied sources, including public institutions and private collectors. We illustrate these challenges by comparing two analyses of gender in Mimbres pottery images. Both analyses used the same procedures, but one included material in private collections, while the second drew on a smaller but more controlled sample. Gender distinctions and division of labor were revealed by the first analysis, but the results were not duplicated in the reanalysis using the controlled sample. We consider reasons for the difference, addressing how collectors’ interests may skew collections and suggesting that some particularly desirable Mimbres pottery designs were created using modern paint. The article concludes with recommendations for how archaeologists can best use mixed collections. These include considering how collections might be skewed and designing analyses to counterbalance likely issues, more chemical analyses with representative samples to gauge the extent of modern manipulation of Mimbres vessels, collecting data on the provenance (i.e., collection history) of material in order to try to trace the likelihood of post-excavation modifications, and studying the process of collecting as a means of understanding the authenticity of artifacts.\n, \nLa recién adquirida habilidad de los arqueólogos de acceder a vastas colecciones digitales crea oportunidades pero también presenta desafíos cuando esas colecciones provienen de diversas fuentes, incluyendo instituciones públicas y coleccionistas privados. Ilustramos estos cambios por medio de la comparación de dos análisis de género en imágenes de la cerámica mimbres. Ambos análisis usaron los mismos procedimientos, pero uno incluyó material de una colección privada, en tanto que el segundo se basó en una muestra de material más pequeña pero mejor controlada. El primer análisis detectó distinciones de género y división de trabajo, pero estos resultados no fueron replicados por el reanálisis que usó la muestra controlada. Consideramos las razones que explican esta diferencia, proponiendo que los intereses de los coleccionistas pueden distorsionar la obtención de las colecciones. Sugerimos que algunos diseños particularmente deseables en la cerámica mimbres fueron creados usando pintura moderna. El artículo concluye con algunas recomendaciones para un mejor uso de las colecciones mezcladas por parte de los arqueólogos. Estas incluyen considerar los posibles sesgos o distorsiones existentes en colecciones y como diseñar análisis para contrarrestar probables problemas; implementar más análisis químicos con muestras representativas para evaluar la extensión de la manipulación moderna de las vasijas mimbres; reunir datos sobre la procedencia del material (es decir, la historia de las colecciones) para tratar de rastrear la probabilidad de modificaciones post-excavación; y estudiar los procesos de coleccionar como una manera de evaluar la autenticidad de los artefactos.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Hegmon","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"McGrath","given":"James R."},{"family":"Munson","given":"Marit K."}],"citation-key":"hegmon2017","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2017.2","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",5]]},"language":"en","page":"138-146","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"The Potential and Pitfalls of Large Multi-Source Collections: Insights from the Analysis of Mimbres Gender Imagery","title-short":"The Potential and Pitfalls of Large Multi-Source Collections","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/potential-and-pitfalls-of-large-multisource-collections/59D8C43F42EEE7D6A04F36E4D62D09CC","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"heilen2013","abstract":"Archaeologists have traditionally collected artifacts during survey in order to analyze them in a laboratory setting and curate the artifacts and associated documentation for future analysis, interpretation, and preservation. In recent decades, however, there has been a trend in the western United States to avoid collection during survey and to relegate most artifact analysis to the field, typically conducted by field crew. Despite heavy reliance on in-field analysis to characterize sites during survey, very little is known about how accurate and adequate in-field analysis is for site interpretation and management. This article presents the findings of a pilot experiment that tested in-field analysis and digital photograph analysis at two sites in the western United States using multiple quantitative measures and qualitative assessments. The results of the analysis show that in-field analysis has a strong potential to yield inaccurate and highly variable results that can lead to the misidentification and misinterpretation of important site components. We recommend that sample collections be made during survey, where possible, and properly curated. For projects in which in-field analysis is used, we recommend that in-field analysis be tested using similar methods to determine whether it can meet an acceptable standard.\n, \nTradicionalmente, los arqueólogos recolectaron artefactos durante las investigaciones de campo con el fin de analizarlos en el laboratorio, resguardándolos junto con la documentación asociada a ellos para su posterior análisis, interpretación, y conservación. En las últimas décadas, sin embargo, ha existido una tendencia en el oeste de los Estados Unidos de prescindir de la recolección de artefactos durante las investigaciones de campo, dejando en manos del equipo de investigación de campo la tarea del análisis de los artefactos al ser estos localizados. A pesar de la fuerte dependencia del análisis de campo para determinar sitios durante las prospecciones, muy poco se conoce sobre la precisión de este tipo de análisis para la identificación de sitios arqueológicos, su interpretación y manejo. Este artículo presenta los resultados de un experimento piloto que puso a prueba el análisis de campo y análisis de fotografía digital en dos sitios localizados en el oeste de Estados Unidos, utilizando múltiples medidas cuantitativas y evaluaciones cualitativas. Los resultados de la experiencia piloto muestran que el análisis sobre el terreno es propenso a producir resultados muy variados e imprecisos que pueden conducir a una identificación errónea e interpretación equivocada de los componentes importantes de un sitio arqueológico. Nuestra recomendación es que se realicen recolecciones de muestras durante el reconocimiento, siempre que sea posible, y que estas sean debidamente procesadas. Para los proyectos en los que se utilice el análisis en el campo, se recomienda que este análisis sobre el terreno sea comprobado utilizando métodos similares para determinar si cumplen con un estándar aceptable de precisión.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Heilen","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Altschul","given":"Jeffrey H."}],"citation-key":"heilen2013","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.7183/2326-3768.1.2.121","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",11]]},"language":"en","page":"121-138","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"The Accuracy and Adequacy of In-Field Artifact Analysis: An Experimental Test at Two Archaeological Sites in the Western United States","title-short":"The Accuracy and Adequacy of In-Field Artifact Analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/accuracy-and-adequacy-of-infield-artifact-analysis/5E9A0C32103635A680DB3BDDD3137BA6","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"heilen2023","abstract":"Most archaeological investigations in the United States and other countries must comply with preservation laws, especially if they are on government property or supported by government funding. Academic and cultural resource management (CRM) studies have explored various social, temporal, and environmental contexts and produce an ever-increasing volume of archaeological data. More and more data are born digital, and many legacy data are digitized. There is a building effort to synthesize and integrate data at a massive scale and create new data standards and management systems. Taxpayer dollars often fund archaeological studies that are intended, in spirit, to promote historic preservation and provide public benefits. However, the resulting data are difficult to access and interoperationalize, and they are rarely collected and managed with their long-term security, accessibility, and ethical reuse in mind. Momentum is building toward open data and open science as well as Indigenous data sovereignty and governance. The field of archaeology is reaching a critical point where consideration of diverse constituencies, concerns, and requirements is needed to plan data collection and management approaches moving forward. This theme issue focuses on challenges and opportunities in archaeological data collection and management in academic and CRM contexts.\n, \nLa mayoría de las investigaciones arqueológicas en los Estados Unidos y otros países deben cumplir con las leyes de preservación, si se encuentran en propiedad del gobierno o cuentan con el apoyo de fondos del gobierno. Los estudios académicos y de gestión de recursos culturales (en inglés, CRM) han explorado varios contextos sociales, temporales y ambientales y producen un creciente volumen de datos arqueológicos. Cada vez más datos son de origen digital y muchos datos heredados se digitalizan. Existe un creciente esfuerzo para sintetizar e integrar datos a gran escala y crear nuevos estándares de datos y sistemas de gestión. Los dólares de los contribuyentes a menudo financian estudios arqueológicos cuyo objetivo es, en espíritu, promover la preservación histórica y proporcionar beneficios públicos. Sin embargo, los datos resultantes son difíciles de acceder e más difíciles de poner en práctica y rara vez son recopilados y gestionados tomando en cuenta la seguridad, accesibilidad y reutilización ética de los datos a largo plazo. Un impulso está creciendo para apoyar los datos abiertos y “ciencia pública”, además de reconocer la soberanía de los pueblos indígenas sobre la gobernanza de los datos indígenas. El campo de la arqueología está llegando a un punto crítico donde es necesario considerar diversos grupos, preocupaciones y requisitos para planificar la recopilación de datos y los enfoques de gestión en el futuro. El tema de este número se centra en los desafíos y oportunidades en la recopilación y gestión de datos arqueológicos en contextos académicos y de gestión de recursos culturales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Heilen","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Manney","given":"Shelby A."}],"citation-key":"heilen2023","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2022.41","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2]]},"language":"en","page":"1-10","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Refining Archaeological Data Collection and Management","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/refining-archaeological-data-collection-and-management/34DFDF1CDFE9EF01FCFB563787724EA7","volume":"11"},

Specifically, we study the use of Gabor filter-based texture features, Laws' texture measures, and Haralick's texture measures for automated classification of a set of archaeological ceramic samples from two different Egyptian source materials: Marl clay and Nile clay. The motivation behind this work is the desire to pioneer the introduction of fully automated methods for pattern classification into the domain of archaeological science, where these can be extremely useful. The texture features are all extracted in a completely automated fashion and the classification is performed via a simple classification algorithm, the k-NN classifier. An accuracy of nearly 74% was obtained with base on the Laws' texture features.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hein","given":"Irmgard"},{"family":"Rojas-Domínguez","given":"Alfonso"},{"family":"Ornelas","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"D'Ercole","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Peloschek","given":"Lisa"}],"citation-key":"hein2017","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2017.12.032","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,27]]},"source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Automated classification of archaeological ceramic materials by means of texture measures","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X17308520"},

  {"id":"henrikson2015","abstract":"A statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate whether sport climbing has contributed to de-vegetation at the base of basalt cliffs within the American Falls Archaeological District (AFAD), located along the Snake River in southern Idaho and currently managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR). The increasing popularity of sport climbing has created challenging conflicts between public recreation and cultural resource protection. The loss of vegetation in the AFAD’s dune environment, from both recreation and natural processes, has already displaced and damaged significant archaeological resources. The Access Fund acknowledges that staging areas at the base of climbs are susceptible to vegetation loss and erosion, especially in arid environments. Since numerous “bare spots” occur under and along basalt cliffs throughout the AFAD, this analysis was designed to quantify these un-vegetated areas. The results of the analysis, which indicate that bare spots directly associated with climbing walls are significantly larger than those that appear to be natural, will be applied in management decisions regarding the protection and preservation of federally managed cultural resources within the AFAD. Hopefully, these results will assist other land management agencies in making proactive decisions regarding recreational use in archaeologically sensitive areas.\n, \nSe realizó un análisis estadístico para evaluar si los deportes de escalada han contribuido a la pérdida de vegetación de los acantilados de basalto en American Falls Archaeological District (AFAD), localizado a lo largo del río Snake en el sur de Idaho y que es actualmente administrado por las oficinas del Bureau of Land Management (BLM) y del Bureau of Reclamation (USBR). La creciente popularidad de los deportes de escalada han creado conflictos desafiantes para la recreación pública y la protección de los recursos culturales. La pérdida de vegetación en el medio ambiente de dunas del AFAD, por ambos procesos recreativos y naturales, ya ha desplazado y dañado recursos arqueológicos importantes. El Access Fund reconoce que las áreas de montaje al pie de los ascensos son susceptibles de pérdida de vegetación y de erosión, especialmente en los medios áridos. Dado que se presentan zonas desnudas debajo y a lo largo de los acantilados de basaltos de AFAD, este análisis se diseño para cuantificar estas áreas sin vegetación. Los resultados del análisis, que indican que las zonas desnudas asociadas a la subida de paredes son mucho más grandes que aquellas que parecen ser naturales , podrán implementarse en la toma de decisiones relacionadas a la protección y preservación de los recursos culturales federalmente administrados dentro de la AFAD. Ojalá, estos resultados ayuden a otras agencias dedicadas a la administración del territorio a tomar decisiones preventivas en torno a las actividades recreativas en áreas arqueológicamente sensibles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Henrikson","given":"Lael Suzann"},{"family":"Camp","given":"Amanda M."}],"citation-key":"henrikson2015","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.7183/2326-3768.3.2.153","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",5]]},"language":"en","page":"153-165","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Evaluating the Physical Effects of Sport Climbing on Archaeological Sites","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/evaluating-the-physical-effects-of-sport-climbing-on-archaeological-sites/96DE08C351F767AB065CA692359BC12E","volume":"3"},

Even though these methods are an increasing part of archaeological research worldwide, there have been few conferences, meetings, or workshops dedicated to sharing methods and applications in digital archaeology in North America or even in the Western Hemisphere, with the exception of a few special sessions in regional or general archaeological conferences.

  {"id":"herrmann2019","abstract":"Bronze and Iron Age fortresses in South Caucasia have long been interpreted as evidence for the region's first territorial polities with complex bureaucracies, but it has only been through recent intensive survey and examination of settlements beside fortresses that archaeologists have developed a better understanding of the inhabitants of fortress-polities and their landscapes. Near-surface geophysical prospection near two hillforts overlooking the Arpaçay river valley, Naxçıvan Autonomous Republic, Azerbaijan, evaluated previously published hypotheses about Bronze and Iron Age fortresses. These two forts, Oğlanqala, a 12-hectare hilltop fortress inhabited in the Iron Age, and Qızqala 1, a 2-hectare fort with Middle Bronze Age and Iron Age pottery, were previously documented through survey and excavations as part of the Naxçıvan Archaeological Project (NAP). Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and magnetic gradiometry surveys focused on areas of potential significance identified in the NAP. Magnetic gradiometry survey in the plain between Oğlanqala and Qızqala located a fortification wall segment that connects to previously recorded surface features argued to date to the Middle Iron Age; the path of this wall lends support to the hypothesis that it enclosed least 324 ha surrounding Oğlanqala and Qızqala and limited access to a narrow mountain pass and fertile lands in the river valley. Geophysical prospection at a settlement site on a bedrock shelf near Qızqala 1 suggests that architectural remains are preserved within part of the large enclosure. Geophysical prospection elsewhere in the alluvial plain did not reveal evidence for preserved architecture within or outside of the hypothesized enclosure, though this could be a result of soil conditions. Magnetic gradiometry of a Middle Bronze Age kurgan field outside of the enclosure identified the potential locations of burials that were not identified during surface survey. New sources of historical satellite imagery aided interpretation of geophysics results from highly-disturbed alluvial areas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Herrmann","given":"Jason T."},{"family":"Hammer","given":"Emily Louise"}],"citation-key":"herrmann2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.02.019","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"page":"663-676","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Archaeo-geophysical survey of Bronze and Iron Age fortress landscapes of the South Caucasus","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18306254","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"hill2019","abstract":"In the last few years Unpiloted Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, have been widely adopted by archaeologists as an important tool for archaeological survey, excavation recording, and heritage site management. As the technology has improved and costs plummeted, it has become possible to record increasingly large areas at high resolution. Now that drones are a common part of the archaeological toolkit, there is increasing interest in affordable ways to improve accuracy and survey efficiency in the field. This paper presents quantifiable results comparing multiple strategies for drone data collection from a local test site in New Hampshire, as well as a pair of examples of deploying such systems in the field. Results demonstrate low-cost methods using DIY-style drones and Post Processed Kinematic GNSS data recording can increase fieldwork efficiency and produce high-resolution ortho-imagery with better than decimeter accuracy without the need for ground control.

  {"id":"hill2019a","abstract":"Archaeologists have long recognized that precise three-dimensional coordinates are critical for recording objects and features across sites and landscapes. Traditionally, for relatively small areas, an optical transit or, more recently, an electronic distance measurement device (EDM) has been used to acquire these three-dimensional points. While effective, such systems have significant limitations in that they require a clear line of site. Real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS/GNSS systems (Global Positioning System/Global Navigation Satellite Systems) have been available for well over a decade, and can provide quick and accurate point measurements over a wide area without many of the limitation of older technologies. The cost of such systems, however, has generally been prohibitive for archaeologists, and so their use has been rare. Recently, a new generation of low-cost systems has become available, making this technology more accessible to a wider user base. This article describes the use, accuracy, and limitations of one such low-cost system, the Emlid Reach RS, to show why this is an important tool for archaeological fieldwork., Desde hace tiempo los arqueólogos han reconocido que las coordenadas tridimensionales exactas son cruciales para registrar la ubicación de rasgos y objetos en relación a sitios y paisajes. Tradicionalmente, para encontrar esos puntos tridimensionales en sitios relativamente pequeños se han utilizado niveles topográficos o, más recientemente, instrumentos electrónicos para medir distancias. Aunque eficaces, tales sistemas tienen limitaciones significativas ya que requieren una línea visual libre de obstrucciones. Los sistemas de posicionamiento global (GPS) o sistemas globales de navegación por satélite (GNSS) con navegación cinética satelital en tiempo real (RTK, todos por sus siglas en inglés) están disponibles desde hace una década y pueden ofrecer mediciones precisas y rápidas de puntos en un amplio entorno sin muchas de las limitaciones de las tecnologías más antiguas. Sin embargo, el costo de este tipo de sistemas ha sido generalmente prohibitivo para los arqueólogos y por lo tanto son poco utilizados. Recientemente ha sido desarrollada una nueva generación de sistemas más económicos que facilita el acceso a estas tecnologías para una base de usuarios más amplia. En este artículo se describen el uso, grado de precisión y limitaciones de uno de estos sistemas más económicos, el Emlid Reach RS, para mostrar que es una herramienta importante para el trabajo de campo arqueológico.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Hill","given":"Austin Chad"},{"family":"Limp","given":"Fred"},{"family":"Casana","given":"Jesse"},{"family":"Laugier","given":"Elise Jakoby"},{"family":"Williamson","given":"Malcolm"}],"citation-key":"hill2019a","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2018.50","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5]]},"language":"en","page":"169-177","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"A New Era in Spatial Data Recording: Low-Cost GNSS","title-short":"A New Era in Spatial Data Recording","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/new-era-in-spatial-data-recording-lowcost-gnss/9AEBF138EA202EC76686A63283508312","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"hill2021","abstract":"The collection of 3D point data is a common bottleneck for archaeological excavations despite an increasing range of powerful spatial data collection technologies. Total stations often require a dedicated operator, and they are optimal for excavation-level data collection over relatively short line-of-site distances. Precision Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) require reliable communication with constellations of distant satellites and may not be accurate enough for all data recording contexts. A new category of spatial data collection hardware, called Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS), or “indoor GPS,” has the potential to provide a more cost-effective and efficient approach to the collection of point data during excavations by making 3D point data collection widely available and accessible. Additionally, such systems may allow greater detail in digital field data recording by enabling the collection of shape data via continuous recording. In this article, we present one such IPS system—the Marvelmind IPS—discuss its potential value and limitations, and provide a case study of a field test of the system at the Chalcolithic (4600–3600 BC) site of Horvat Duvshan, Israel.\n, \nLa recolección de datos puntuales en tres dimensiones es un cuello de botella común para las excavaciones arqueológicas, a pesar de un creciente rango de poderosas tecnologías de recolección de datos espaciales.

They include studies of work in a broad range of domains, including call centres, mobile offices, operating theatres, construction sites and control centres. This paper outlines the nature of these video?based studies of work and organisation and highlights some of their major contributions to our understanding of issues such as the nature of skill and expertise, the use of technology and the organisation of teamwork.

The “private investment” model assumes returns to the innovator result from private goods and efficient regimes of intellectual property protection. The “collective action” model assumes that under conditions of market failure, innovators collaborate in order to produce a public good. The phenomenon of open source software development shows that users program to solve their own as well as shared technical problems, and freely reveal their innovations without appropriating private returns from selling the software. In this paper, we propose that open source software development is an exemplar of a compound “private-collective” model of innovation that contains elements of both the private investment and the collective action models and can offer society the “best of both worlds” under many conditions.

  {"id":"hodder2004a","abstract":"This article is concerned with the social processes involved in the formation of large agglomerated villages in the Neolithic of the Near East and Anatolia, with particular reference to Çatalhöyük in central Turkey. The article aims to show that practice theories (dealing with how social rules are learned in daily practice within the house) can be used to interpret the patterning of recurrent construction and use activities within domestic space at Çatalhöyük. The regulation of social practices in the house created village-wide social rules, but it is argued that the habituated behavior was also commemorative and involved in the construction of social memory. Sitewide and house-based specific memories are documented at Çatalhöyük. The evidence for habituated practice and social memory at other sites is briefly discussed, and is argued to be relevant for the formation of settled agricultural societies. /// Este artículo se refiere a los procesos sociales implicados en laformación de grandes aglomeraciones aldeanas en el neolítico del Cercano Oriente y de Anatolia, con particular referencia a Catalhoyuk en Turquía central.

At one level the volume reports on the exciting new discoveries and advances that are being made in the understanding of the 9000 year-old Neolithic site of �atalh�y�k. The site has long been central to debates about early village societies and the formation of 'mega-sites' in the Middle East. The current long-term project has made many advances in our understanding of the site that impact our wider understanding of the Neolithic and its spread into Europe from the Middle East. These advances concern use of the environment, climate change, subsistence practices, social and economic organization, the role of religion, ritual and symbolism. At another level, the volume reports on methodological advances that have been made by team members, including the development of reflexive methods, paperless recording on site, the integrated use of 3D visualization, and interactive archives. The long-term nature of the project allows these various innovations to be evaluated and critiqued. In particular, the volume includes analyses of the social networks that underpin the assembling of data, and documents the complex ways in which arguments are built within quickly transforming alliances and allegiances within the team. In particular, the volume explores how close inter-disciplinarity, and the assembling of different forms of data from different sub-disciplines, allow the weaving together of information into robust, distributed arguments.","author":[{"family":"Hodder","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Marciniak","given":"Arkadiusz"}],"citation-key":"hodder2015a","ISBN":"978-1-910526-00-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"201","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Google Books","title":"Assembling Çatalhöyük","type":"book"},
  {"id":"hodder2016","abstract":"This article explores the extent to which formal network analysis can be used to study aspects of entanglement, the latter referring to the collective sets of dependencies between humans and things. The data used were derived from the Neolithic sites of Boncuklu and Çatalhöyük in central Turkey. The first part of the analysis involves using formal network methods to chart the changing interactions between humans and things at these sites through time. The values of betweenness and centrality vary through time in ways that illuminate the known transformations at the site as, for example, domestic cattle are introduced. The ego networks for houses across four time periods at the two sites are also patterned in ways that contribute to an understanding of social and economic trends. In a second set of analyses, formal network methods are applied to intersecting operational chains, or chainworks. Finally, the dependencies between humans and things are evaluated by exploring the costs and benefits of particular material choices relative to larger entanglements. In conclusion, it is argued that three types of entanglement can be represented and explored using methods taken from the network sciences. The first type concerns the large number of relations that surround any particular human or thing. The second concerns the ways in which entanglements are organized. The third type of entanglement concerns the dialectic between dependence (potential through reliance) and dependency (constraint through reliance).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hodder","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Mol","given":"Angus"}],"citation-key":"hodder2016","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-015-9259-6","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1066-1094","source":"link-springer-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca","title":"Network Analysis and Entanglement","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-015-9259-6","volume":"23"},

The conversation discusses various issues, such as whether symmetry is possible in any kind of relation, how one defines asymmetry, whether there are different kinds of asymmetry, and how inequality between humans is related to the asymmetries in human–thing entanglements. The last issue is considered especially important in light of the various critiques that have been levelled at actor networks and other relational materialisms for their weakened political stance insofar as sources of inequality and injustice are so widely distributed that they become, in effect, apolitical.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Hodder","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Lucas","given":"Gavin"}],"citation-key":"hodder2017","container-title":"Archaeological Dialogues","DOI":"10.1017/S1380203817000137","ISSN":"1380-2038, 1478-2294","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12]]},"page":"119-137","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"The symmetries and asymmetries of human–thing relations.

  {"id":"hodder2018","abstract":"This paper argues that the search for an overarching explanation for the adoption of farming and settled life in the Middle East can be enhanced by a consideration of the dependencies between humans and human-made things from the Late Glacial Maximum onwards. Often not considered in discussions of the origins of agriculture is the long process of human tooth size reduction that started in the Upper Palaeolithic and can reasonably be related to the increased use of grinding stones that created softer and more nutrient-rich plant foods. A consideration of the use of groundstone tools through the Epipalaeolithic and into the Neolithic shows that they were entangled with hearths, ovens, houses and settlements, exchange relations and notions of ownership. The practicalities of processing plants drew humans into pathways that led to intensification, population increase, sedentism and domestication. Much the same can be said for other human-made things such as sickles, storage bins, domestic animal dung and refuse. The dialectical tensions between human-thing dependence and dependency generated the movement towards Neolithicization. Human-thing dependence (involving human dependence on things, thing dependence on humans and thing dependence on other things) afforded opportunities towards which humans (always already in a given state of entanglement) were drawn in order to solve problems. But this dependence also involved dependency, limitation and constraint, leading for example to increases in labour. In order to provide that labour or in other ways to deal with the demands of things and their entanglements with other humans and things, humans made further use of the affordances of things. There was thus a generative spiral leading to sedentism and domestication.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Hodder","given":"Ian"}],"citation-key":"hodder2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-017-9336-0","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"155-177","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Things and the Slow Neolithic: the Middle Eastern Transformation","title-short":"Things and the Slow Neolithic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-017-9336-0","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"hofmann2022","abstract":"Open Science (OS) is envisioned to have a wide range of benefits including being more transparent, shared, accessible, and collaboratively developed than traditional science. Despite great enthusiasm, there are also several challenges with OS. In order to ensure that OS obtains its benefits, these challenges need to be addressed. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to provide an overview of one type of challenge, i.e., epistemological challenges with OS knowledge production, and their ethical implications. Based on a literature review, it (a) reveals factors undermining the envisioned benefits of OS, (b) identifies negative effects on knowledge production, and (c) exposes epistemological challenges with the various phases of the OS process. The main epistemic challenges are related to governance, framing, looping effects, proper data procurement, validation, replication, bias, and polarization. The ethical implications are injustice, reduced benefit (efficiency), increased harm (as a consequence of poor-quality science), deception and manipulation (reduced autonomy), and lack of trustworthiness. Accordingly, to obtain the envisioned benefits of OS, we need to address these epistemological challenges and their ethical implications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Hofmann","given":"Bjørn"}],"citation-key":"hofmann2022","container-title":"Publications","container-title-short":"Publications","DOI":"10.3390/publications10030024","ISSN":"2304-6775","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,14]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"24","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Open Science Knowledge Production: Addressing Epistemological Challenges and Ethical Implications","title-short":"Open Science Knowledge Production","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-6775/10/3/24","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"hogberg2021","abstract":"In this brief introduction, we present and contextualise ‘theoretical pathways’ elaborated in this special issue, in terms of understanding humanity from a deep-time perspective. The participating authors discuss a wide range of approaches related to thinking about human endeavour during the Middle Stone Age and Middle Palaeolithic ranging from the constraints of technological niches and Material Engagement Theory to aspects of palaeo-neurology, agent-based models of self-domestication and co-evolutionary model building. Together, the contributions demonstrate that current theoretical approaches that aim to explain deep-time human endeavour require multi-disciplinary approaches, and that for some researchers, the trend is to move away from the symbolic standard or models of sudden mutation. By doing so, each contribution, in its own way, enhances our understanding of ‘being’ or ‘becoming’ human during the time slice between 300,000 and 30,000 years ago. The work represented here makes it increasingly clear that a singular or particular aspect did not ‘give birth’ to Homo sapiens in Africa during the Middle Stone Age and/or in Eurasia during the Middle Palaeolithic. Instead, humanity in all its complexity was probably shaped by a broad range of factors and processes that took place over an extended period.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Högberg","given":"Anders"},{"family":"Lombard","given":"Marlize"}],"citation-key":"hogberg2021","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-020-09498-z","ISSN":"1573-7764","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-10","source":"Springer Link","title":"Introduction to ‘Theoretical Pathways’: Thinking About Human Endeavour During the Middle Stone Age and Middle Palaeolithic","title-short":"Introduction to ‘Theoretical Pathways’","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-020-09498-z","volume":"28"},
  {"id":"hoggarth2021","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching impacts in all segments of life worldwide. While a variety of surveys have assessed the impacts of the pandemic in other fields, few studies have focused on understanding the short- and long-term impacts of the pandemic for archaeology. To assess these trends, we asked survey respondents (n = 570) if they experienced job loss and to rate the percentage of change in their economic situation, workload, teaching or research activities, and personal responsibilities. Results show alarming trends, with nearly half of those who experienced job loss being under the age of 35 and women and early career archaeologists suffering major economic losses. Impacts to workload, teaching activities, and research activities were also felt across these groups. Substantial increases in personal responsibilities (childcare, eldercare, caring for sick family members) were also identified, especially for women with children under 18 years of age. While structural inequalities have already been identified across different sectors of archaeology, the results of this survey suggest the most vulnerable populations are those most heavily affected. We recommend a variety of strategies for employers, professional organizations, funding agencies, and publishers to consider in mitigating the consequences of COVID-19, especially for women and early career scholars.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoggarth","given":"Julie A."},{"family":"Batty","given":"Sylvia"},{"family":"Bondura","given":"Valerie"},{"family":"Creamer","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Ebert","given":"Claire E."},{"family":"Green-Mink","given":"Kirsten"},{"family":"Kieffer","given":"C.

However, archaeological comparisons using datasets consisting of lots of detailed records remain elusive. Large archaeological datasets are difficult to integrate because it is often functional and therefore interpretative categories that are recorded rather than the phenomena upon which these interpretations are based. Here, we describe a system that maintains a structural separation between recording a simple set of archaeological phenomena, and the functional, behavioral meanings, and temporal associations of these phenomena. Rather than construct a schema that integrates the description of high-level units and relationships, we consider what minimum data entities that might be needed to integrate datasets in relation to archaeological phenomena while still offering the flexibility needed to allow for regional variability in unit construction. We describe the implementation of this system to field recording on Ahuahu (Great Mercury Island), New Zealand, and consider examples of comparative analyses of material recorded using this system from our projects in Australia and Egypt.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Holdaway","given":"Simon J."},{"family":"Emmitt","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Phillipps","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Masoud-Ansari","given":"Sina"}],"citation-key":"holdaway2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-018-9399-6","ISSN":"1573-7764","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"873-893","publisher":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","source":"Springer Link","title":"A Minimalist Approach to Archaeological Data Management Design","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-018-9399-6","volume":"26"},

Although advances in interpretive techniques have been widely adopted, sampling strategies and determinations of appropriate sample sizes for radiocarbon data remain generally underdeveloped. As chronological models are only as robust as the information we feed into them, formal approaches to assessing the validity of model criteria and the appropriate number of radiocarbon dates deserve attention.

As an alternative, I present an ethnographic approach, studying the ‘life’ of a pot sherd on an excavation project. All the thing’s properties and characteristics, including its material identity and age, are taken to be the outcome of processes taking place in the present. The data presented shows in some detail how ‘momentary, fluid and flexible’ archaeological classifications and interpretations of material culture are. It emerges that the material identities ascribed to things are not their essential properties but the result of specific relationships of people and things: their very materiality is potentially multiple and has a history.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Holtorf","given":"Cornelius"}],"citation-key":"holtorf2002","container-title":"Journal of Material Culture","container-title-short":"Journal of Material Culture","DOI":"10.1177/1359183502007001305","ISSN":"1359-1835","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"49-71","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Notes on the Life History of a Pot Sherd","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1359183502007001305","volume":"7"},

The evaluation of software is a complex topic, since its field of application and development context has a considerable influence. In addition, there are many very different use cases, ranging from students wanting a quick solution for an exercise to project developers, who have to integrate a software package into an existing infrastructure for continuous operation. Although this discussion paper is based on equal contributions from archaeology and applied computer science, the focus is on evaluation criteria for software in the field of archaeology. A major goal of this paper is to alert future reviewers to the complexity of software evaluation. A software review should enable a professional archaeological audience to make a quick, critical and fair, to both the product and the developers assessment of the software. Priority recommendations include a description of the context in which the review was written and the requirements for specific use cases. In addition, a short tabular overview should enable a quick assessment of the technical, financial and legal aspects. The need for future adaptations of this guideline was identified at the outset since both software development and its evaluation in the digital age are expected to remain very dynamic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Homburg","given":"Timo"},{"family":"Klammt","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Mara","given":"Hubert"},{"family":"Schmid","given":"Clemens"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Sophie Charlotte"},{"family":"Thiery","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Trognitz","given":"Martina"}],"citation-key":"homburg2021","container-title":"Archäologische Informationen","DOI":"10.11588/AI.2020.1.81423","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,28]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","page":"357-370 Seiten","publisher":"Archäologische Informationen","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Recommendations for the review of archaeological research software","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/arch-inf/article/view/81423"},

  {"id":"hookk2016","abstract":"Abstract The appearance of computers as super-brain inspires the hope that archaeology will solve the problem of the multidimensional data presentation. Since 1970s, the international conferences on the computer application in archaeology have discussed the advantages of new technologies. During one of them in 1990, the term virtual archaeology was introduced for the first time by Paul Reilly. He discussed both possibilities: visualizing in the computer screen the total amount of data obtained from the fieldwork and using the technologies applied in the computer games production for scientific aims. The word visualization also became the keyword of the definition given 20 years later in the International Charter on Virtual Аrchaeology. However, in 2007, this interpretation was exposed to critic. Virtual archaeology aims at the application of computer technologies for the creation of high-quality images of archaeological objects as well as in assistance to the archaeological studies. Time has gone; many applied sciences introduced computer technologies, and the possibility to unify and accumulate, to analyse and to demonstrate data appeared. Today, any big scientific research of the archaeological monument supposes the application of natural sciences and computer technologies. The archaeological excavations and virtual archaeology are parts of one infinite process, and the virtual archaeology means all the newest kinds of computer technologies used for archaeological investigations, data processing, modeling, archaeological and historical reconstruction and evident representation of their results. Since the time of Paul Reilly’s definition, the meaning of the term virtual transformed from imaginary to existing in our understanding. It looks curious, but maybe very soon, instead of virtual archaeology, it will be possible to say up-today archaeology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Hookk","given":"Daria"}],"citation-key":"hookk2016","container-title":"Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences","container-title-short":"Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences","DOI":"10.1007/s12520-014-0201-8","ISSN":"1866-9557","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"647-650","source":"Scholars Portal Journals","title":"From illusions to reality: transformation of the term ‛virtual archaeology’","title-short":"From illusions to reality","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.scholarsportal.info/detailsundefined","volume":"8"},

They both comprise the principal unit of science’s social reward system and they establish epistemic genealogy, showing the foundations on which claims are built. Distorted or problematic citing behaviour can hence have major harmful consequences for the well-functioning of the scientific enterprise. In this article we employ a case study approach to show how, even in the field of research integrity, or more broadly, meta-research, researchers commonly adhere to suboptimal citing practices. Our findings highlight, among other shortcomings, an apparent lack of critical engagement with the cited literature, leading to incorrect reproductions of claims and overgeneralisation of supposed research findings. We link such problematic citing practices to the state of crisis that science is currently claimed to face, discussing how these practices might be both a symptom and a cause of these crises.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Horbach","given":"Serge P.

  {"id":"horn2019a","abstract":"Rock art provides a tangible visual link to past communities and has significant value in building our understanding of prehistoric societies. Its recording and interpretation has long provided a window to intangible aspects of society, such as belief systems and folk narratives. Petroglyphic rock art has traditionally been recorded through simple rubbing, or frottage, and the majority of interpretations and narratives to date have been based on this work. Recently, three-dimensional capture techniques have become readily available and they replace traditional approaches to rock art recording. These techniques are valuable, but the data-heavy outputs lack the interpretive clarity of traditional methods. This paper explores these issues through a novel approach that employs topographic landscape analysis techniques, initially developed for LiDAR processing, to produce clear images that have the precision and dimensional accuracy of 3D captured data, but the visual clarity of traditional methods. Specifically, this paper outlines an approach based on local relief modelling (a technique that highlights subtle topographic features) and explores its efficacy through case studies of Bronze Age Scandinavian petroglyphs.

  {"id":"hornborg2014","abstract":"This article discusses how the way in which post-Enlightenment humans tend to relate to material objects is a fundamental aspect of modern capitalism. The difficulties that conventional academic disciplines have in grasping the societal and political aspect of ‘technology’ stem from the predominant Cartesian paradigm that distinguishes the domain of material objects from that of social relations of exchange. This Cartesian paradigm has constrained the Marxian analysis of capital accumulation from extending the concept of fetishism to the domain of technology. Both Marxian and mainstream thought represent technological objects as empowered by their intrinsic properties, which derive from human ingenuity and tend to progress over time. To transcend this paradigm will be possible only through the kind of post-Cartesian perspective on material artefacts that has been championed by Bruno Latour. However, Latour’s own neglect of technological systems as social strategies of exploitation reflects his lack of concern with global inequalities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Hornborg","given":"Alf"}],"citation-key":"hornborg2014","container-title":"Theory, Culture & Society","container-title-short":"Theory, Culture & Society","DOI":"10.1177/0263276413488960","ISSN":"0263-2764, 1460-3616","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",7]]},"language":"en","page":"119-140","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Technology as Fetish: Marx, Latour, and the Cultural Foundations of Capitalism","title-short":"Technology as Fetish","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0263276413488960","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"horowitz2021","abstract":"Stone raw material in the past was often extracted, processed, and used by different individuals. The relationships among these practices make quarries important spaces for understanding how economic interactions function within society and what role access to resources plays in economic organization. This paper addresses the acquisition of raw materials through a focus on chert and limestone quarrying practices in the Maya area. Using three Classic period (200–950 a.d.) case studies from different sub-regions of the Maya lowlands, we highlight both shared and distinct practices and illustrate the roles that these extraction spaces played within Classic Maya economies. We find that heterogeneous aspects of quarrying techniques throughout the Maya lowlands result from variability in local geologic conditions, management structures, and the intended uses of the raw materials. As a result, this paper establishes methods for archaeologists to integrate quarries into their studies of past economies and anthropogenic landscapes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Horowitz","given":"Rachel A."},{"family":"Clarke","given":"Mary E."},{"family":"Seligson","given":"Kenneth E."}],"citation-key":"horowitz2021","container-title":"Journal of Field Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00934690.2021.1947562","ISSN":"0093-4690","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,17]]},"page":"551-570","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Querying Quarries: Stone Extraction Practices and Socioeconomic Organization in Three Sub-Regions of the Maya Lowlands","title-short":"Querying Quarries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00934690.2021.1947562","volume":"46"},

In this regard, the adoption of genetic analyses into archaeological investigations has paralleled many previous adoptions including those of radiometric dating, stable isotope analysis and chemical analysis of material culture. Employing DNA data in reconstructions of prehistory, however, has been hampered particularly by the expense of generating the data – both financial and logistical – and, at least initially, by unwarranted resistance to take seriously molecular data. While the expense continues to rise as new techniques become available, there has been a reversal in the place of genetic data in that it is now privileged over other sources of data. This kind of molecular chauvinism leads to overreach in interpretation and is no less likely to hamper our progress. Moving forward we would do best be judicial in the use of genetic data alongside other independent archaeological evidence in reconstructing the past.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Horsburgh","given":"K.

Social order is itself premised on a material order, making it impossible to become human other than through socialising within a material world of cultural artefacts, and includes the order, agency and relationships between things, and not just their relationship to persons. This article considers the consequences of the digital culture for our understanding of what it is to be human. Drawing upon recent debates concerning materiality in the sub-field of digital anthropology, we focus upon four forms of materiality – the materiality of digital infrastructure and technology; the materiality of mediation; the materiality of digital content; and the materiality of digital contexts – to make the case that digital media and technology are far more than mere expressions of human intention. Rather than rendering us less human, less authentic or more mediated, we argue that attention should turn to the human capacity to create or impose normativity in the face of constant change. We believe these debates around materiality and normativity, while rooted in the discipline of anthropology, have broader implications for understanding everyday practices in the digital age.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Horst","given":"Heather"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"horst2012","container-title":"Media International Australia","container-title-short":"Media International Australia","DOI":"10.1177/1329878x1214500112","ISSN":"1329-878X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"103-111","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Normativity and Materiality: A View from Digital Anthropology","title-short":"Normativity and Materiality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1329878X1214500112","volume":"145"},

We suggest that the wider issues can now more fruitfully be debated in the broader context of parallels and contrasts with the development of the economy in late Imperial China and of its bookkeeping and accounting systems.

Three themes related to both persistent questions and emergent horizons in archaeological GIS are explored in the context of the contributions. We present our own set of ideas for how to unbind our analyses from some of the methodological and conceptual constraints inherent in the analytic GIS approaches on which we have long relied to explore past landscapes. We argue it is important to keep moving beyond analytic approaches tethered to discrete points, to push forward geospatial modeling of cultural processes across entire landscapes, and to incorporate uncertainty and iteration directly into our work. Through such efforts, we can develop robust insights into the ways past communities considered, reconfigured, and renewed patterns of social, economic, and ideological interaction, flow, and circulation through the variegated landscapes they inhabited.

  {"id":"howey2020","abstract":"The concept of “big” data is nothing new to archaeologists; we have long made a profession of collecting, organizing, and analyzing a surfeit of data describing everything from minute artifact attributes to landscape-wide environmental characteristics. Regardless of this abundance, we have and continue to confront the self-same problem inherent in “big” data, namely what analyses will actually help us use these data to advance understandings of past human behaviors. With burgeoning remote sensing technologies archaeology faces a new wave of “big” data, but how do these techniques improve our ability to make the inferential leaps to bridge the present to the past and bring new insights forward? We argue that, to date, remote sensing techniques (satellite, aerial, and unpersonned aerial imagery) have been applied somewhat narrowly to mostly high-resolution site-based research in archaeology. To truly unleash the capabilities of these techniques, and expand our capacity for wrangling “big” data to more fully investigate past patterns, we need to conduct iterative analyses incorporating remotely sensed data on bounded archaeological sites and regions and unbounded landscapes.

  {"id":"howland2018","abstract":"3D recording of archaeological sites is one of the trendiest applications in archaeology today. Archaeologists are increasingly devoted to applying three-dimensional approaches, with a variety of techniques and results. As these methods become increasingly common, archaeologists face an important challenge: that of ensuring the data they collect is relevant to the research questions they investigate. For many archaeologists, anthropologically focused or otherwise, these questions may often relate to grand narratives of culture change or similarly broad topics. Very little effort has gone into connecting the results or outputs of the ongoing “3D revolution” in archaeology to broader theoretical issues, with no middle range theory adequately connecting these new methods to one of archaeology’s ultimate goals—studying culture change. It has yet to be established whether or not 3D recording will form the basis of the next revolution in archaeological practice akin to the development and ubiquitous adoption of archaeological GIS, if it will be seen as a purely methodological advance, or even if it will be relegated to sideshow status as an aesthetically pleasing but ultimately unproductive party trick. This chapter will discuss the usefulness of 3D field recording for contributing to the grand narratives told by archaeology and take a critical perspective as to whether or not 3D recording can truly contribute to answering the questions asked by archaeologists worldwide regardless of region or era of focus.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Howland","given":"Matthew D."}],"citation-key":"howland2018","collection-title":"One World Archaeology","container-title":"Cyber-Archaeology and Grand Narratives: Digital Technology and Deep-Time Perspectives on Culture Change in the Middle East","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-65693-9_2","editor":[{"family":"Levy","given":"Thomas E."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Ian W.

  {"id":"howlett2010","abstract":"This book discusses how facts travel, and when and why they sometimes travel well enough to acquire a life of their own. Whether or not facts travel in this manner depends not only on their character and ability to play useful roles elsewhere, but also on the labels, packaging, vehicles and company that take them across difficult terrains and over disciplinary boundaries. These diverse stories of travelling facts, ranging from architecture to nanotechnology and from romance fiction to climate science, change the way we see the nature of facts. Facts are far from the bland and rather boring but useful objects that scientists and humanists produce and fit together to make narratives, arguments and evidence. Rather, their extraordinary abilities to travel well shows when, how and why facts can be used to build further knowledge beyond and away from their sites of original production and intended use.","author":[{"family":"Howlett","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Morgan","given":"Mary S."}],"citation-key":"howlett2010","ISBN":"978-1-139-49239-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",11,15]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"487","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"How Well Do Facts Travel?: The Dissemination of Reliable Knowledge","title-short":"How Well Do Facts Travel?","type":"book"},

How do practicing bioarchaeologists (and enthusiastic supporters of the field) communicate about their own and others’ research, fieldwork, laboratory work, et cetera? With ever-greater amounts of scientific communication and public outreach conducted over social media (e.g., Gura 2013; Kling and McKim 2000; Wheat et al. 2013), it is worth investigating how the living who study the dead interact with each other, form community, and engage online audiences that increasingly contain descendants of the dead being studied.

Although we are generally comfortable with the idea that technology has changed the way we live our everyday lives, and the ever-increasing pace of that change, for some reason there appears to be a general reluctance to consider that such changes and the pace of these changes may also impact on archaeology. This paper proposes that computer-using archaeologists have for too long ignored a critical area of research: the consequences of the new information and communication technologies we use. Archaeologists point with justifiable pride to the tradition of self-critical analysis of new ideas and methodological changes within the subject. Archaeologists question their data, their methodologies, their theories, their conclusions, the very basis of their subject, yet it appears that archaeology operates within a “bubble”, somehow immune to the consequences of the new technologies that are more and more a part of both the world around us and of archaeology itself. Furthermore, archaeologists are accustomed to theorising about technological changes in the past (ranging from new flint technologies, bronze and iron working, the evolution of the plough, developments in literacy, and so on), and may bring new perspectives to contemporary analysis of the technological world around us.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Huggett","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"huggett2004","container-title":"Archeologia e Calcolatori","ISSN":"1120-6861","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"language":"it","page":"81-92","source":"eprints.bice.rm.cnr.it","title":"Archaeology and the new technological fetishism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.archcalc.cnr.it/indice/PDF15/05_Hugget.pdf","volume":"15"},

Even the Wikipedia page on computational archaeology describes archaeoinformatics as an emerging discipline.

  {"id":"huggett2015b","abstract":"Since the mid-1990s the development of online access to archaeological information has been revolutionary. Easy availability of data has changed the starting point for archaeological enquiry and the openness, quantity, range and scope of online digital data has long since passed a tipping point when online access became useful, even essential. However, this transformative access to archaeological data has not itself been examined in a critical manner. Access is good, exploitation is an essential component of preservation, openness is desirable, comparability is a requirement, but what are the implications for archaeological research of this flow – some would say deluge – of information? Lucas has recently pointed to the way archaeological reality can change as a consequence of intervention: as archaeologists change their mode of intervention so reality shifts and interpretations change (Lucas 2012, 216). If this is true of archaeological practice, to what extent might the change in our relationship to data – the move from traditional modes of creation and access to digitally-enhanced methods – represent a potential paradigm shift in our archaeological reality, or place limits on future changes? As  more data are 'born digital' with access to them open to an increasingly wide audience, is it realistic to assume that archaeological knowledge itself remains unchanged in the process? How does our relationship with archaeological data change as the observations, measurements, uncertainties, ambiguities, interpretations and values encapsulated within our datasets are increasingly subject to scrutiny, comparison, and re-use? What are the implications of increasing access to increasing quantities of data drawn from different sources which are more or less open, more or less standardised, and increasingly reliant on search tools with greater degrees of automation and linkage? Given the fundamental – and frequently contested – nature of archaeological data, it is surprising that the implications of open access to those data remain largely uncontested. Instead, archaeology's digital haystack represents a largely unexplored set of practices mixing old and new in the creation of new infrastructures which transform the packaging, presentation, and analysis of the past. Examining this entails revisiting the notion of the 'archaeological record' within the context of the new technological frameworks, and considering the consequences of this digital data intervention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Huggett","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"huggett2015b","container-title":"Open Source Archaeology: Ethics and Practice","editor":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"Andrew T."},{"family":"Edwards","given":"Ben"}],"ISBN":"978-3-11-044017-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11]]},"language":"en","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","page":"6-29","publisher":"De Gruyter Open","source":"eprints.gla.ac.uk","title":"Digital haystacks: open data and the transformation of archaeological knowledge","title-short":"Digital haystacks","type":"chapter","URL":"http://www.degruyter.com/view/product/460080"},

While we have extensive digital archives equipped to share data, evidence of reuse seems paradoxically limited. Most archaeological discussions have focused on data management and preservation and on disciplinary practices surrounding archiving and sharing data. This article addresses the reuse side of the data equation through a series of linked questions: What is the evidence for reuse, what constitutes reuse, what are the motivations for reuse, and what makes some data more suitable for reuse than others? It concludes by posing a series of questions aimed at better understanding our digital engagement with archaeological data., La conservación de datos en formato digital se basa en la expectativa de su posterior reutilización y aprovechamiento.

  {"id":"huggett2020a","abstract":"The availability and accessibility of digital data are increasingly significant in the creation of archaeological knowledge with, for example, multiple datasets being brought together to perform extensive analyses that would not otherwise be possible. However, this makes capturing the silences in those data—what is absent as well as present, what is unknown as well as what is known—a critical challenge for archaeology in terms of the suitability and appropriateness of data for subsequent reuse. This paper reverses the usual focus on knowledge and considers the role of ignorance—the lack of knowledge, or nonknowledge—in archaeological data and knowledge creation. Examining aspects of archaeological practice in the light of different dimensions of ignorance, it proposes ways in which the silences, the range of unknowns, can be addressed within a digital environment and the benefits which may accrue.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Huggett","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"huggett2020a","container-title":"Information-an International Interdisciplinary Journal","container-title-short":"Information","DOI":"10.3390/info11050278","ISSN":"2078-2489","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,21]]},"language":"english","page":"278","title":"Capturing the Silences in Digital Archaeological Knowledge","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/11/5/278","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"huggett2022a","abstract":"Archaeology operates in an increasingly data-mediated world in which data drive knowledge and actions about people and things. Famously, data has been characterized as “the new oil”, underpinning modern economies and at the root of many technological transformations in society at large, even assuming a near-religious power over thought and action. As the call for this Special Issue recognizes, archaeological research is socially and historically situated and consequently influenced by these same broader developments. In archaeology, as in the wider world, data is the foundation for knowledge, but its capacity is rarely reflected upon. This paper offers just such a reflection: a meditation on the nature of archaeological digital data and the challenges for its (re)use. It asks what we understand by data: its etymology and comprehension, its exceptionality and mutability, its constructs and infrastructures, and its origins and consequences. The concept of the archaeological data imaginary is introduced to better understand approaches to the collection and use of archaeological data, and a case study examines how knowledge is mediated and remediated through the data embedded in grey literature. Appreciating the volatility and unpredictability of digital data is key in understanding its potential for use and reuse in the creation of archaeological knowledge.","author":[{"family":"Huggett","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"huggett2022a","container-title":"Digital","DOI":"10.3390/digital2020016","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6]]},"language":"english","page":"267–295","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Data Legacies, Epistemic Anxieties, and Digital Imaginaries in Archaeology","type":"article-journal","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"huggett2023a","abstract":"The last 30 years have seen significant investments in the development of digital infrastructures to support archaeological practice. From field recording systems to national data archives, these have come to play an increasingly dominant role in the collection, management, and access to the data used in the creation of new archaeological knowledge. Although a lot of attention has been paid to the technical creation of such systems, much less is said about the wider political, cultural and social aspects of these infrastructures. Focusing on large-scale national or transnational data infrastructures, this paper seeks to lay the groundwork for such an inquiry by making the infrastructure the centre of analysis, rather than its technical aspects. The paper asks how infrastructures emerge, are sustained, become embedded in practice, and how they subsequently contextualise and influence the formation of archaeological knowledge. The underlying and frequently hidden complexities of infrastructures and their nature as always under development should make a critical understanding of their implementation and application, the opportunities they offer, the constraints they impose, and the perspectives they adopt, an important precursor to their knowledgeable use in practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Huggett","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"huggett2023a","container-title":"Current Swedish Archaeology","DOI":"10.37718/CSA.2023.01","ISSN":"2002-3901","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2024 Jeremy Huggett","page":"11-38","source":"publicera.kb.se","title":"Deconstructing the Digital Infrastructures Supporting Archaeological Knowledge","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://publicera.kb.se/csa/article/view/13084","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"huizing2011","abstract":"Introduction. The purpose of this paper is to introduce to information science in a coherent fashion the core premises of contemporary practice theory, and thus to engage the information research community in further debate and discussion.\nMethod. Contemporary practice-based approaches are summarised in an ensemble of five core premises by means of a broad conceptual analysis of the relevant literature. Differentiated from its historical antecedents by central ideas from science and technology studies, particularly actor-network theory and the sociology of translation, this current practice movement builds on the latest practice 'turn' which is then used to answer the question of how practice theory could contribute to information science.\nResults. Capturing the distinct ontology, epistemology and methodology of current practice theory, the five key premises provide novel insights in transcending the macro-objectivist and micro-subjectivist levels of analysis, in sociomateriality, in stretching interactions to action nets to conceptualize dynamic organizing, in the sharing of tacit knowledge, in the emergent nature of knowing and learning, and in social order and change as dynamic outcomes of the tightly interwoven processes of doing, knowing and organizing.\nConclusions This paper distinguishes the everyday notion of practice, mostly understood as practices, from contemporary practice theory which aspires to integrate practice ontology, epistemology and methodology into a coherent theoretical framework. This upcoming theory offers a dedicated vocabulary and approach to all of those information scientists who either focus on macro-structures or micro-interactions in their studies, but feel at risk of ignoring or missing important dimensions of social order and change in action.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Huizing","given":"Ard"},{"family":"Cavanagh","given":"Mary"},{"literal":"others"}],"citation-key":"huizing2011","container-title":"Information Research Journal","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"page":"497","source":"Google Scholar","title":"Planting contemporary practice theory in the garden of information science","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dare.uva.nl/record/1/362839","volume":"16"},

The fundamental insight of this literature is that documents are not simply instruments of bureaucratic organizations, but rather are constitutive of bureaucratic rules, ideologies, knowledge, practices, subjectivities, objects, outcomes, even the organizations themselves. It explores the reasons why documents have been late to come under ethnographic scrutiny and the implications for our theoretical understandings of organizations and methods for studying them. The review argues for the great value of the study of paper-mediated documentation to the study of electronic forms, but it also highlights the risk of an exclusive focus on paper, making anthropology marginal to the study of core bureaucratic practices in the manner of earlier anthropology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Hull","given":"Matthew S."}],"citation-key":"hull2012","container-title":"Annual Review of Anthropology","container-title-short":"Annu.

  {"id":"hummon1993","abstract":"Social network analysis has emerged as an integrated scientific specialty concerned with the structural analysis of social interaction. Historical evidence suggests that members of this specialty are connected by an invisible college, a shared paradigm and a primary journal. The journal Social Networks is a primary outlet for researchers in this specialty, particularly those concerned with methodological issues. By examining the pattern of citations within this journal we are able to confirm this historical evidence and gain insight into how science is being conducted by members of this specialty. Using main path analysis, we examined the pattern in the citation network in the first 12 volumes of the journal. We found six main path structures of connected articles that define and describe core developments in the specialty. The most important of these structures focuses on role analysis, and spans all 12 volumes of Social Networks. We find a high density of multiple citations, both to articles within the journal and to key articles outside the journal, and many authors who have published more than a single article in the journal. In addition, the main path tree structures extend through much of the total network, have a single identifiable coherent substantive concern, and are incremental in nature. The pattern of these main paths, and the overall citation pattern, is consistent with a pattern of scientific development labeled by Kuhn as ‘normal science’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hummon","given":"Norman P."},{"family":"Carley","given":"Kathleen"}],"citation-key":"hummon1993","container-title":"Social Networks","container-title-short":"Social Networks","DOI":"10.1016/0378-8733(93)90022-D","ISSN":"0378-8733","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993",3,1]]},"page":"71-106","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Social networks as normal science","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037887339390022D","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"hunt2015","abstract":"Excavations in the photic zones of caves have provided cornerstone archaeological sequences in many parts of the world. Before the appearance of modern dating techniques, cave deposits provided clear evidence for the antiquity, relative ages and co-occurrence of ancient human remains, material culture and fauna. Earlier generations of archaeologists had generally rather limited understanding of taphonomic and depositional processes, but the twentieth century saw considerable improvement in excavation and analytical techniques. The advent of modern dating and chronological methodologies offers very powerful tools for the analysis of cave fill deposits and this has resulted in the recognition of chronological incoherence in parts of some sites, with consequent re-evaluation of previous archaeological disputes. Obtaining multiple dates per context provides a means to assess the integrity and coherence of the archaeological and environmental records from cave fills. In the case of the Haua Fteah (Libya), this technique allowed the recognition of chronological coherence in low-energy depositional environments and limited recycling in high-energy contexts. We provide a conceptual model of the relationship between recycling, sedimentation rate and process energy. High-resolution investigation enables recognition of the complexity of the formation of cave sequences, thus an increasingly sophisticated understanding of human behaviour and environmental relationships in the past, and potentially gives a new life to old data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Hunt","given":"Chris O."},{"family":"Gilbertson","given":"David D."},{"family":"Hill","given":"Evan A."},{"family":"Simpson","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"hunt2015","collection-title":"Scoping the Future of Archaeological Science: Papers in Honour of Richard Klein","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2015.02.030","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",4,1]]},"page":"109-116","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Sedimentation, re-sedimentation and chronologies in archaeologically-important caves: problems and prospects","title-short":"Sedimentation, re-sedimentation and chronologies in archaeologically-important caves","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030544031500076X","volume":"56"},

  {"id":"hunter1998","abstract":"Recently, the Flote-Tech machine-assisted flotation system was introduced as a new technique for processing soil samples in arid environments and areas with limited or no access to water resources. This system uses water recirculation in a closed loop between a water reservoir and a flotation tank, aided by diffused air, to extract archaeological botanical remains from soil samples. The paper presents two experiments conducted to assess macroremain recovery rate, flotation rate, and the potential for cross-contamination between soil samples. In addition, Flote-Tech recovery and flotation rates are compared with rates achieved using IDOT manual and SMAP machine-assisted systems. The first set of experiments using the original 1-mm screen in the flotation box received high ratings for large, medium, and small seeds, but rated poorly for very small seeds. After installing a .5-mm screen, a higher percentage of small and very small seeds was recovered. Flotation rates for the customized Flote-Tech system ranked high, matching flotation rates for SMAP systems and out-performing manual IDOT systems by a factor of four to eight. In addition, a distinct advantage of the Flote-Tech system over other machine-assisted and manual systems is the elimination of cross-contamination between samples.\n, \nRésumé\nRecientemente, el sistema de flotación asistida por la máquina Flote-Tech fue introducido corno una nueva técnica para procesar muestras de suelo en los medioambientes y áreas con acceso limitado o sin acceso a los recursos de agua. Este sistema utiliza la recirculación de agua en un circuito cerrado entre un tanque de agua y un tanque de flotación, ayudado por el aire difundido, para extraer restos botánicos arqueológicos de los muestras de suelos. Este papel presenta dos experimentos llevados a cabo para evaluar la tasa de recuperación de los macrorestos, la tasa de flotación, y la capacidad de contaminación entre elementos de las muestras de suelo. El estudio compara además las tasas de recuperación y de flotación por Flote-Tech con las tasas obtenidas utilizando los sistemas de flotación asistida por máquina IDOT (Illinois Department of Transportation) y SMAP (Shellmound Archaeological Project). El primer bloque de pruebas con el filtro original de 1 mm en la caja de flotación obtuvo tasas altas para semillas grandes, medianas, y pequenas, y muy bajas para las semillas muy pequeñas. Después de instalar un filtro de .5 mm, se recuperó un porcentaje más alto de semillas pequeñas y muy pequenas. Las tasas de flotación con el sistema Flote-Tech adaptado resultaron altas, igualándose con las tasas de flotación para los sistemas SMAP y mejorándose los sistemas manuales IDOT en un factor de cuatro a ocho. Además, una ventaja distinta del sistema Flote-Tech sobre otros sistemas mecanizados o manuales, es la eliminación de contaminacion entre elementos de las muestras.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Hunter","given":"Andrea A."},{"family":"Gassner","given":"Brian R."}],"citation-key":"hunter1998","container-title":"American Antiquity","DOI":"10.2307/2694781","ISSN":"0002-7316, 2325-5064","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",1]]},"language":"en","page":"143-156","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Evaluation of the Flote-Tech Machine-Assisted Flotation System","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/evaluation-of-the-flotetech-machineassisted-flotation-system/1212BE8D94FBB0633127CF51F9F8EE35","volume":"63"},

  {"id":"huster2013","abstract":"Archaeologists often overlook museum collections for research purposes due to concerns about the representativeness of the artifacts in the collection. Such concerns can be addressed by comparing non-scientifically produced collections to collections of known standing, such as those from more modern projects, using the same exploratory data analysis and basic statistical methods that archaeologists use to compare sets of artifacts in other situations. As a case study, this article compares spindle whorls recovered during the 2007 excavations at the Aztec site of Calixtlahuaca with two museum collections of whorls attributed to the site. A variety of metric and non-metric traits were recorded for each item in the three collections and were compared using Kolmogrov-Smirnov, Chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests. Both museum collections show a bias toward more elaborately decorated pieces, but with varying side effects on other attributes of analytical interest.\n, \nMuchas veces, los arqueólogos evitan usar las colecciones de museos porque dudan que los artefactos de la colección sean una muestra representativa.

  {"id":"huston2019","abstract":"Open Data is part of a broad global movement that is not only advancing science and scientific communication but also transforming modern society and how decisions are made. What began with a call for Open Science and the rise of online journals has extended to Open Data, based on the premise that if reports on data are open, then the generated or supporting data should be open as well. There have been a number of advances in Open Data over the last decade, spearheaded largely by governments. A real benefit of Open Data is not simply that single databases can be used more widely; it is that these data can also be leveraged, shared and combined with other data. Open Data facilitates scientific collaboration, enriches research and advances analytical capacity to inform decisions. In the human and environmental health realms, for example, the ability to access and combine diverse data can advance early signal detection, improve analysis and evaluation, inform program and policy development, increase capacity for public participation, enable transparency and improve accountability. However, challenges remain. Enormous resources are needed to make the technological shift to open and interoperable databases accessible with common protocols and terminology. Amongst data generators and users, this shift also involves a cultural change: from regarding databases as restricted intellectual property, to considering data as a common good. There is a need to address legal and ethical considerations in making this shift. Finally, along with efforts to modify infrastructure and address the cultural, legal and ethical issues, it is important to share the information equitably and effectively. While there is great potential of the open, timely, equitable and straightforward sharing of data, fully realizing the myriad of benefits of Open Data will depend on how effectively these challenges are addressed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Huston","given":"P"},{"family":"Edge","given":"VL"},{"family":"Bernier","given":"E"}],"citation-key":"huston2019","container-title":"Canada Communicable Disease Report","container-title-short":"Can Commun Dis Rep","DOI":"10.14745/ccdr.v45i10a01","ISSN":"1188-4169","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,3]]},"page":"252-256","PMCID":"PMC6781855","PMID":"31647060","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Reaping the benefits of Open Data in public health","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6781855/","volume":"45"},

  {"id":"hutchins1995","abstract":"Cognitive science normally takes the individual agent as its unit of analysis. In many human endeavors, however, the outcomes of interest are not determined entirely by the information processing properties of individuals. Nor can they be inferred from the properties of the individual agents, alone, no matter how detailed the knowledge of the properties of those individuals may be. In commercial aviation, for example, the successful completion of a flight is produced by a system that typically includes two or more pilots interacting with each other and with a suite of technological devices. This article presents a theoretical framework that takes a distributed, socio?technical system rather than an individual mind as its primary unit of analysis. This framework is explicitly cognitive in that it is concerned with how information is represented and how representations are transformed and propagated in the performance of tasks.

  {"id":"huvila2008","abstract":"Introduction. A work roles and role theory-based approach to conceptualise human information activity, denoted information work analysis is discussed. The present article explicates the approach and its special characteristics and benefits in comparison to earlier methods of analysing human information work.\nMethod. The approach is discussed in the light of the results of an empirically-based qualitative investigation of the information work of Finnish and Swedish archaeology professionals. The material was gathered in a series of twenty-five thematic interviews, which comprised a variety of different interview approaches. \nAnalysis. The data were analysed by using a grounded theory approach, which comprised iterative writing, schema analysis and validity checks. \nResults. Information work analysis is an approach that explicitly focuses on information and work, from an information management point of view and perceives the two as social and cultural, instead of merely cognitive, issues. Unlike the information technology-oriented analytical frameworks, information work analysis aims at improving information work as a comprehensive enterprise instead of merely looking at how to develop a computerised information system.\nConclusions. Information work analysis provides a description and understanding of real world phenomena, but it is also an instrument, which aims at providing necessary premises for changing and developing the present state of affairs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Huvila","given":"Isto"}],"citation-key":"huvila2008","container-title":"Information Research: An International Electronic Journal","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"source":"Google Scholar","title":"Information work analysis: an approach to research on information interactions and information behaviour in context.","title-short":"Information work analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://informationr.net/ir/13-3/paper349.html","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"huvila2008b","abstract":"Reviewed 19 November 2007 Purpose – Both task-based and work-oriented research approaches have proved their value in Accepted 22 November 2007 information science research. A task is a workable analytical unit of human activity, which brings the level of explication close enough to cater for individual actions and their consequences. Similarly, work and work roles have been effective concepts at explicating the broad patterns of professional information activity. Major issues of the existing approaches are the difﬁculty of conceptualising the contexts of tasks and the relatively high level of abstraction of a work level scrutiny. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how the concepts of “work”, “work role” and “task” might be integrated into a common research agenda. It is suggested that the explication of work and work roles might serve in providing additional understanding on the formation of the purposes, meanings and values, which guide the shaping of the activities conceptualised as tasks. Design/methodology/approach – The issue is discussed in general with a reference to an empirical study of information work of archaeology professionals informed by the notion of work role. Findings – It is suggested that the broader notions of work and work roles are useful concepts for explicating the context of more speciﬁc tasks. Research limitations/implications – The suggested approach brings together task and work – work role-based research and provides a basis for exploring human information activity from a broader perspective than before and thus improving the general understanding of why and how information is used as it is used. Practical implications – The study provides an approach to conceptualise the ways how people work with information and lays the ground for improving information management and organisation practices. Originality/value – There has been little prior discussion about integrating the task and work-based approaches. The paper suggests that the explication of work and work roles might serve in providing additional understanding on the formation of the purposes, meanings and values, which guide the shaping of the activities conceptualised as tasks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Huvila","given":"Isto"}],"citation-key":"huvila2008b","container-title":"Journal of Documentation","DOI":"10.1108/00220410810912406","ISSN":"0022-0418","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",10,17]]},"language":"en","page":"797-815","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Work and work roles: a context of tasks","title-short":"Work and work roles","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/00220410810912406/full/html","volume":"64"},

This information process is examined by discussing some fundamental characteristics of archaeological data, and the information aimed for the general public. On the basis of these characteristics and suggested functions of the information, a framework for a flexible data model is introduced to increase the efficiency of the process to produce and leverage relevant and usable information for the needs of tourism.

The present article discusses the applicability of the records continuum model and its generalisation, continuum thinking, as a theoretical framework for explicating the overlap and evolution of the diverse contexts of personal information and their implications for personal information management practices. Method: This article is based on three empirical case studies on 1) the personal information management practices of sound artists (qualitative semi-structured interviews), 2) graduate students' management of scholarly articles (web survey of Swedish students) and 3) the management of personal archives at Swedish archival institutions (qualitative semi-structured interviews). Analysis: The empirical material was analysed using the constant comparative method (case 1), non-parametric statistical tests including Friedman's test, Kruskal-Wallis analysis, Wilcoxon-Signed Rank test, Mann-Whitney-U test and Chi-square test in SPSS version 20.0 (case 2), and thematic analysis (case 3). Results: The continuum approach and the conceptualisation of diverse contextual aspects of personal information management as axes on a Giddensian spatio-temporal continuum can help to understand the contextual changes and continuities of personal information management and use. Conclusions: The records continuum model provides a useful theoretical basis for explicating personal information management as a process of Giddensian time-space structuration similarly to how Upward argued that the theory is useful in the context of explicating the record-keeping process and, in more general terms, providing a framework for theorising particular types of document-centric management processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Huvila","given":"Isto"},{"family":"Eriksen","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Häusner","given":"Eva-Maria"},{"family":"Jansson","given":"Ina-Maria"}],"citation-key":"huvila2014b","container-title":"Information Research: An International Electronic Journal","ISSN":"1368-1613","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3]]},"language":"en","source":"ERIC","title":"Continuum Thinking and the Contexts of Personal Information Management","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1020832","volume":"19"},

The quality of reports has been a subject of debate, and recently it has been argued that more emphasis should be placed on making primary research data at least similarly available. This study explores the changing materialities and reciprocal formation of documents and their users with the advent of digitization, and how documents form and lose their status as boundary objects in these processes. The study posits that in order to be functional, a boundary object needs to provide a disclosure that makes it accessible to cognate communities. Further, it shows how assumptions about the functioning of the human and nonhuman (material artifacts) influence the ways in which archaeologists conceptualize the preservation and archiving of archaeological information and the role and potential of different types of digital and paper-based documents.

Besides providing an apparatus to describe the nexus of information provision and acquisition, a closer consideration of the parallel doings opens opportunities to enrich the inquiry of the conditions and practice of information seeking, appropriation, discovery, and retrieval as modes taking, and learning and information use as its posterities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Huvila","given":"Isto"}],"citation-key":"huvila2021","container-title":"Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology","DOI":"10.1002/asi.24599","ISSN":"2330-1643","issue":"n/a","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Making and taking information","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.24599","volume":"n/a"},

This article reports findings of an interview study conducted in Sweden (N=10) that focuses on providing an in-depth description of archaeology heritage administrators’ work with a focus on their information work practices and factors that influence how it unfolds. The findings show that its critical success factors focus on the adequacy and availability of resources, personal experience and functioning collaborations with key stakeholders and colleagues, and balancing between following and interpreting formal guidelines, boundaries and standards of the work. Based on a reading of the findings inspired by Luhmann and White, it is suggested that the administrators’ ability to balance between standards and ambiguity and regulate their personal contextual distance to the projects they were working on helped them switch between acting as subject experts and relying on others to maintain a control over their information work-as-whole.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Huvila","given":"Isto"}],"citation-key":"huvila2021a","container-title":"Open Information Science","DOI":"10.1515/opis-2020-0121","ISSN":"2451-1781","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"190-214","publisher":"De Gruyter Open Access","source":"www-degruyter-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca","title":"Ambiguity, standards and contextual distance: archaeological heritage administrators and their information work","title-short":"Ambiguity, standards and contextual distance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opis-2020-0121/html","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"huvila2021b","abstract":"The entanglement of social information technologies and their users unfolds as a problem if “wrong” users enmesh with “wrong” technologies. A long-standing debate on the merits of photorealism versus non-photorealism in archaeological visualization provides an educating example of such a “problematic” or in Haraway's words, monstrous social information technology. This article shows how a closer look at the perceived monstrosities of social information technologies can help us understand how people conceptualize information, technologies, and other people and their role in information interactions as they unfold as part of information work. It shows how a lifelike photorealistic visualization together with its spectator forms a cyborg, which is a monstrous runaway “object” when it drives with its own cultural force a programme that contradicts with other programmes considered important. The parallels in the critiques of archaeological visualizations and other informational cyborgs in information research – including search engines, information systems and services – suggest usefulness of a monstrous perspective in the analysis of social information technologies in general.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Huvila","given":"Isto"}],"citation-key":"huvila2021b","container-title":"The Information Society","DOI":"10.1080/01972243.2020.1830211","ISSN":"0197-2243","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"page":"46-59","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Monstrous hybridity of social information technologies: Through the lens of photorealism and non-photorealism in archaeological visualization","title-short":"Monstrous hybridity of social information technologies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01972243.2020.1830211","volume":"37"},
  {"id":"huvila2021c","abstract":"Purpose Sharing information about work processes has proven to be difficult. This applies especially to information shared from those who participate in a process to those who remain outsiders. The purpose of this article is to increase understanding of how professionals document their work practices with a focus on information making by analysing how archaeologists document their information work in archaeological reports. Design/methodology/approach In total 47 Swedish archaeological reports published in 2018 were analysed using close reading and constant comparative categorisation. Findings Even if explicit narratives of methods and work process have particular significance as documentation of information making, the evidence of information making is spread out all over the report document in (1) procedural narratives, (2) descriptions of methods and tools, (3) actors and actants, (4) photographs, (5) information sources, (6) diagrams and drawings and (7) outcomes. The usability of reports as conveyors of information on information making depends more on how a forthcoming reader can live with it as a whole rather than how to learn of the details it recites. Research limitations/implications The study is based on a limited number of documents representing one country and one scholarly and professional field. Practical implications Increased focus on the internal coherence of documentation and the complementarity of different types of descriptions could improve information sharing. Further, descriptions of concepts that refer to work activities and the situation when information came into being could similarly improve their usability. Originality/value There is little earlier research on how professionals and academics document and describe their information activities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Huvila","given":"Isto"},{"family":"Sköld","given":"Olle"},{"family":"Börjesson","given":"Lisa"}],"citation-key":"huvila2021c","container-title":"Journal of Documentation","DOI":"10.1108/JD-11-2020-0188","ISSN":"0022-0418","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"page":"1107-1127","publisher":"Emerald Publishing Limited","source":"Emerald Insight","title":"Documenting information making in archaeological field reports","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-11-2020-0188","volume":"77"},
  {"id":"huvila2022","abstract":"Considerable investments have been made in Europe and worldwide for developing research data infrastructures. Instead of a general lack of data about data, it has become apparent that a pivotal factor that drastically constrains data use is the absence of contextual knowledge about how data was created and how it has been curated and used. This applies especially to many branches of social science and humanities research, where data is highly heterogeneous, both by its kind (e.g. being qualitative, quantitative, naturalistic, purposefully created) and origins (e.g. being historical/contemporary, from different contexts and geographical places). The problem is that there may be enough metadata (data about data) but there is too little paradata (data on the processes of its creation, curation and use). The aim of this position paper is to draw attention 1) to the need for a better and more systematic understanding and documentation of the contexts of creation, curation and use of research data to make it useful and usable for researchers and other potential users in the future, and 2) to specific obstacles that make the capturing of this particular type of metadata, known as paradata , especially difficult. Failing to understand what information about the creation, curation and use of research data is needed and how to capture enough of that information risks that the currently collected vast amounts of research data become useless in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Huvila","given":"Isto"}],"citation-key":"huvila2022","container-title":"Open Information Science","DOI":"10.1515/opis-2022-0129","ISSN":"2451-1781","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"28-48","publisher":"De Gruyter Open Access","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"Improving the usefulness of research data with better paradata","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opis-2022-0129/html","volume":"6"},

This article investigates how researchers cite methods literature, and to what extent and how these citations could function as a form of paradata i.e., descriptive data on research processes. Method. Citations to two prominent field manuals were retrieved using Scopus; full-texts were obtained for analysis. Analysis. Descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis were used. Results. Field manuals are cited both for compliance and contrast to clarify procedures and actions, understanding of what is considered conventional and extra-ordinary, to elucidate work processes in broader terms, and to explain concepts and what is common disciplinary knowledge. Even if literature use seems indicative of work procedures, a citation to a method cannot necessarily be considered as direct evidence of what was done in reality. Conclusions. Citations to field manuals can function as a complementary form of paradata to other information on how archaeological work has been conducted. However, rather than forming a standalone corpus of evidence, they can be expected to function best if combined with other indicators. A citation to a specific methods text can be indicative of certain patterns of work or presence of a shared scope of relevance with other works citing the same text.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Huvila","given":"Isto"},{"family":"Andersson","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Sköld","given":"Olle"}],"citation-key":"huvila2022a","container-title":"Information Research: an international electronic journal","container-title-short":"IR","DOI":"10.47989/irpaper941","ISSN":"13681613","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,15]]},"source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Citing methods literature: citations to field manuals as paradata on archaeological fieldwork","title-short":"Citing methods literature","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://informationr.net/ir/27-3/paper941.html","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"huvila2023","abstract":"Archaeology is a profoundly social and collaborative enterprise. Even if it is a discipline of things, archaeology is also a discipline of discourses of things. The making of new archaeological information and knowledge both leans on and weaves a conversation of the past that is fundamentally as social as it is material. These conversations traverse an immense spectrum of archaeological practices and contexts far beyond archaeology itself. This chapter provides an overview of how discourses are produced in archaeology, their characteristics and contemporary facets, and how studying the social production of archaeological discourse(s) is helpful for understanding archaeology and archaeological knowledge. Discourse refers not only to talking or writing about archaeology but documenting, communicating and conveying archaeology, archaeological information and knowledge in diverse means, and by doing that, influencing archaeological practices and the production of archaeological knowledge. The chapter starts by asking where contemporary archaeological discourse is produced and continue to inquiring into who participates and who are left out, how to analyse and explain archaeological discourses, what characterises them, and finally, why understanding the social production of archaeological discourse can be useful for archaeologists and non-archaeologists.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Huvila","given":"Isto"}],"citation-key":"huvila2023","collection-title":"Quantitative Archaeology and Archaeological Modelling","container-title":"Discourse and Argumentation in Archaeology: Conceptual and Computational Approaches","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-031-37156-1_6","editor":[{"family":"Gonzalez-Perez","given":"Cesar"},{"family":"Martin-Rodilla","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Pereira-Fariña","given":"Martín"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-031-37156-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"115-136","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"The Social Production of Discourse in Archaeology","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-37156-1_6"},
  {"id":"huvila2023a","abstract":"This chapter inquires into how two specific types of epistemic artefacts—traces and ingredients—work together and against each other in conveying understanding of past knowledge-making activities. The discussion draws from an analysis of Swedish and French archaeological investigation reports and from how they, as traces and ingredients, contribute to knowing-in-practice in multiple parallel ways as a part of archaeological practice—literally in practice. Traces and ingredients have different epistemic opportunities and limitations to act as records of the past and goads to action even if many traces can act as ingredients and vice versa albeit with certain limitations that are useful to be aware of. Being aware of how an epistemic artefact works in an epistemic sense—for example as a trace or an ingredient—can help to use them accordingly to what they are capable of, to avoid uses that go against their potential, and to develop better ones.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Huvila","given":"Isto"},{"family":"Sköld","given":"Olle"},{"family":"Andersson","given":"Lisa"}],"citation-key":"huvila2023a","container-title":"The Posthumanist Epistemology of Practice Theory: Re-imagining Method in Organization Studies and Beyond","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-031-42276-8_2","editor":[{"family":"Cozza","given":"Michela"},{"family":"Gherardi","given":"Silvia"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-031-42276-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"37-69","publisher":"Springer Nature Switzerland","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"Knowing-in-Practice, Its Traces and Ingredients","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-42276-8_2"},

The paper compares features in extracts from 21 textbooks in\nmicrobiology, marketing and applied linguistics with a similar corpus of\nresearch articles and shows that the ways textbook authors represent themselves,\norganise their arguments, and signal their attitudes to both their\nstatements and their readers differ markedly in the two corpora. It is suggested\nthat these differences mean that textbooks provide limited rhetorical\nguidance to students seeking information from research sources or learning\nappropriate forms of written argument.

Activity theory is argued to be particularly relevant in the context of knowledge work since the body of knowledge is a historically accumulated social construction. Situated activity theory makes a distinction between activities, tasks and encounters, the first two following the traditional distinction between activity and action in activity theory. Encounters are incorporated to explicitly model the temporal organisation of work. Referring to the high variety of knowledge work, situated activity theory suggests an instantiation process in which an activity is instantiated into an action working on a single object of work. The culturally developed activity system is seen to serve as a significant resource and constraint in the process. Influenced by the ideas of situated action, the instantiation process is viewed as continuous process that takes place in close concert with the action as it unfolds.","author":[{"family":"Iivari","given":"J."},{"family":"Linger","given":"H."}],"citation-key":"iivari1999","container-title":"Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences. 1999.

  {"id":"ion2019","abstract":"In a recent intervention, Romanian philosopher and essayist Andrei Pleşu (2018) writes on the topic of destiny,\nWe are not caught blindly in a network of ‘fatal’ causes and effects, rather we are integrated in an ‘epic’ structure, on a pathway which includes an ‘intrigue’, a host of significant events, sometimes stimulating, while at other times destabilising, in a ‘story’ whose makeup can only be revealed at the end of the ‘spectacle’.\nArchaeology is a discipline in the privileged position of engaging with things when they have seen their end lives and conclusions, at the end of the ‘spectacle’. The downside is that sometimes too much time has passed, and traces have got lost, while at other times we forget that any story had a development, alongside moments when things could have turned out quite differently. Thus, upon trying to interpret change in the past, we sometimes end up with what Arponen and colleagues tackle in their article, namely deterministic explanations. Their article raises some points directly related to the implications of a particular kind of data set – palaeo-environmental studies – for framing historical explanations. This range of studies has become more important in recent years, as part of a wider resurgence of scientific technologies applied to interpreting the past. This trend has been accompanied by important implications, revealing the problem of integrating data sets of different kinds, from natural sciences to social sciences towards explaining historical processes. As the authors highlight, most often the explanation proceeds by identifying patterns in different data sets, climate record and archaeology, which are then correlated, and if they match they are interpreted in a causal key.

  {"id":"ireland2021","abstract":"High-fidelity imaging methods such as laser scanning and digital photogrammetry have captured public and professional audiences in a flurry of optimistic discourse about their capacities as forms of preservation and of archaeological recording and interpretation. With technical finesse and mastery, endangered heritage can, it is argued, be captured, re-materialized, and recovered from the forces that threaten it. As the plot concerning our ‘digital futures’ thickens, we discuss here an experimental project that offers an oblique approach to the practice of 3D visualization, one that subverts the dominance of neutral, technical field engagements. We examine digital materiality by exploring digital heritage objects as both method and site of ethnographic encounter. Orbiting the ruins of Asinou, an abandoned village in the Troodos Mountains of Cyprus, with our ‘low-tech’ equipment, we sought to observe the conditions of the ‘in-between’ of two makeshift forms, each as ‘real’ as the other. We focus our thinking on the tensions of translation that play on the surface of our technically crude digital assemblages, as spaces of generative potential for speculations about encounters with emerging digital materialities, their affective capacities and status as future heritage objects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Ireland","given":"Tracy"},{"family":"Bell","given":"Tessa"}],"citation-key":"ireland2021","container-title":"Museum and Society","DOI":"10.29311/mas.v19i2.3663","ISSN":"1479-8360","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,30]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2021 Tracy Ireland, Tessa Bell","number":"2","page":"149-165","source":"journals.le.ac.uk","title":"Chasing Future Feelings: A Practice-led Experiment with Emergent Digital Materialities of Heritage","title-short":"Chasing Future Feelings","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.le.ac.uk/ojs1/index.php/mas/article/view/3663","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"jackson2016","abstract":"Archaeological documentation is in the midst of a technological shift as recording systems transition from paper-based forms to digital formats. Digital systems effectively replicate the information recorded on paper forms, while also offering recording advantages for archaeologists in the field. In addition to such logistical contributions to archaeological workflows, digital technology also has tremendous potential to transform the ways that archaeology is done by shifting how we see our sites, and how we document them through diverse data types. With the goal of exploring this potential, we developed a tablet-based relational database, using FileMaker, which provides the ability to simultaneously record specific characteristics of artifacts and features according to two cultural perspectives—modern archaeological understandings and also those of the Classic Maya. In this article, we describe the database and discuss the results of a pilot field season using the database to record excavations at the site of Say Kah, Belize. Our experiences yield several broader reflections on the impact of using digital recording systems both for practical advantage and for productive shifts in perception.\n, \nLa documentación arqueológica se encuentra en medio de un cambio tecnológico mediante el cual los sistemas de registro cambian del papel a formatos digitales.

  {"id":"jackson2017","abstract":"This paper explores a Classic Maya (ca. AD 250–900) “material vision”—that is, a locally determined and culturally specific way of understanding the material world, its salient qualities, and associated meanings—based on evidence found in hieroglyphic texts from across the Maya world. Understanding Classic Maya ways of seeing the material world is an important undertaking as part of exploring alignments and misalignments between ancient indigenous and modern archaeological understandings of what today we view as “artifacts.” This topic is explored in the article through two related inquiries: first, I look at “artifacts” (i.e., materials that qualify as such, in an archaeological material vision) recorded in the hieroglyphic record, yielding thematic understandings of objects related to form and function, wholeness versus brokenness, and the relational potential of objects. Second, I use ten hieroglyphic property qualifiers that indicate Maya material perceptions and categories to gain explicit insight into some organizing principles within a Maya way of visualizing the material world. Throughout the article, I ask: can we envision archaeological objects using Maya conceptions, and how does this way of seeing align or misalign with archaeological material engagements?","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Jackson","given":"Sarah E."}],"citation-key":"jackson2017","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-016-9278-y","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"579-610","source":"link-springer-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca","title":"Envisioning Artifacts: a Classic Maya View of the Archaeological Record","title-short":"Envisioning Artifacts","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-016-9278-y","volume":"24"},

To identify individual members of the communities of practice who were involved in the creation of parietal art in the Franco-Cantabrian region we have analysed the age and the sex of the people who ‘decorated’ the caves. Secondly, by following the analysis of lines created by flutings by different members of the community of practice, we suggest that children under the age of seven, who had no the cognitive abilities to comprehend the meaning of images, were active and prolific fluters and performed acts of decorating cave walls by themselves or with the support of other community members.

The archiving, reuse and re-analysis of data is often considered intrinsic to archaeological practice, not least because of the destructive nature of excavation. The idea that the pace of adoption of new digital technologies can outstrip the development of the infrastructure required for sustainable access to its outputs, ultimately leading to the loss of data, is sometimes referred to as the ‘Digital Dark Age’ problem. While strenuous efforts have been made to address this issue, the recent rapid uptake of a new wave of tools to enhance access, promote wider dialogue and gather data has the potential to recreate this problem. This is particularly true because of the volatile technical, legal and commercial contexts in which much of this work takes place.

  {"id":"jensen2018","abstract":"The photorealistic and geometrically accurate 3-dimensional representation of excavations, provided by image-based modeling, has the potential to transform the process of excavation documentation, making it easier to share observations with other researchers. Paradoxically, however, spatial representation lacks the ability to convey archaeological interpretations. By example of excavations in Alken Enge, Denmark, this paper explores how a web-based 3D platform is able to facilitate the collaborative exchange of 3D excavation content and how the integration of spatial and attribute data into one common event-based data model may be advantageous. This includes enhancing the semantic value of field-recorded 3D models by segmenting the geometry using various techniques, such as 3D projections and machine learning. Accordingly, the paper demonstrates a framework for interactive 3D models, which includes attributed classification based on segmented 3D content correlated with traditional raster, vector, and textual data, delivering a spatially integrated platform for collaborative research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Jensen","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"jensen2018","container-title":"Journal of Field Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00934690.2018.1510299","ISSN":"0093-4690","issue":"sup1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,31]]},"page":"S31-S44","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Semantically Enhanced 3D: A Web-based Platform for Spatial Integration of Excavation Documentation at Alken Enge, Denmark","title-short":"Semantically Enhanced 3D","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00934690.2018.1510299","volume":"43"},

Xeros is a graph structure and a set of operations that can deal with the addition, edition, and removal of interpretations. This data model is a specialisation of the W3C PROV provenance data model, tracking the evolution of interpretations.

  {"id":"jha2021","abstract":"We develop a conceptual governance framework to guide creating and managing a modular interorganizational network to address complex social problems. Drawing on theoretical foundations in modularity and interorganizational networks, we propose that modularizing complex social problems is a dialectic, emergent process that blends a convener-led network formation with a consultative problem definition and solution design. We also posit that social systems are imperfectly modular and need purposefully designed interface governance to integrate the modules. Finally, we advance how leveraging modularity may simultaneously advance the interests of participating actors and deliver societal value. Together, the propositions advance a governance framework for a modular, multi-actor adaptive system suited to tackle the scale, diversity, and dynamics of complex social problems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Jha","given":"Srivardhini K."},{"family":"Gold","given":"E.

  {"id":"johnson2014","abstract":"This paper argues for subsuming the question of open data within a larger question of information justice, with the immediate aim being to establish the need for rather than the principles of such a theory. I show that there are several problems of justice that emerge as a consequence of opening data to full public accessibility, and are generally a consequence of the failure of the open data movement to understand the constructed nature of data. I examine three such problems: the embedding of social privilege in datasets as the data is constructed, the differential capabilities of data users (especially differences between citizens and “enterprise” users), and the norms that data systems impose through their function as disciplinary systems. In each case I show that open data has the quite real potential to exacerbate rather than alleviate injustices. This necessitates a theory of information justice. I briefly suggest two complementary directions in which such a theory might be developed: one defining a set of moral inquiries that can be used to evaluate the justness of data practices, and another exploring the practices and structures that a social movement promoting information justice might pursue.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"Jeffrey Alan"}],"citation-key":"johnson2014","container-title":"Ethics and Information Technology","container-title-short":"Ethics Inf Technol","DOI":"10.1007/s10676-014-9351-8","ISSN":"1572-8439","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"263-274","source":"Springer Link","title":"From open data to information justice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10676-014-9351-8","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"jones2017a","abstract":"Over 30 years ago, Kintigh and Ammerman (1982) outlined and applied a heuristic approach to spatial archaeology that balanced quantitative analyses and culturally and historically contextualized archaeology. The theoretical and methodological messages were that we need to do more than “eyeball” spatial patterns, we need to apply the proper analyses based on the characteristics of our datasets, and we need to ensure that our models, quantitative analyses, and resulting interpretations are based in the proper cultural and historical contexts. My goal in this paper is to examine how two of the concepts in this approach, significance and context, apply to a modern spatial archaeology that heavily utilizes geospatial computing tools. Although these tools help to solve several concerns that existed in the field 30 years ago, they can also cause others, such as mistaking autocorrelation for correlation or confusion about which of the multitude of available analytical tools is appropriate for particular questions and datasets. In this paper, I present a simplified version of the methodology I have used to address these concerns. I use archaeological, historical, and GIS-modeled data to compare the regional patterning of hierarchical and egalitarian societies in southeastern North America to examine why hierarchical sociopolitical organizations may have arose where they did. I end with a critical review of this approach and a discussion of how such research can be improved moving forward.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Jones","given":"Eric E."}],"citation-key":"jones2017a","collection-title":"Archaeological GIS Today: Persistent Challenges, Pushing Old Boundaries, and Exploring New Horizons","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2017.05.009","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,1]]},"page":"54-62","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Significance and context in GIS-based spatial archaeology: A case study from Southeastern North America","title-short":"Significance and context in GIS-based spatial archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440317300729","volume":"84"},
  {"id":"jones2018","abstract":"In the past two decades, rapid advances have been made in the application of digital technology to archaeology, which have led to the creation of the field of cyber-archaeology. Much of the work in this field, however, has focused on the technical aspects of applying specific technologies to archaeological field and laboratory work. As cyber-archaeology matures, however, it is necessary to consider how these novel methods can contribute to the development of archaeological theory. The chapters in this volume do this by examining potential contributions of cyber-archaeology to “grand narratives” of human history.This introductory chapter sets the stage for the chapters that follow. It opens with a description of recent advances in cyber-archaeology—defined, in the context of this volume, as “the integration of the latest developments in computer science, engineering, science, and archaeology” (following Levy 2013: 28)—as well as problems that remain to be solved. One lingering problem is the difficulty of bringing disparate datasets together into digital databases, and this is explored using an example from the Digital Archaeological Atlas of the Holy Land (DAAHL). This limitation suggests that while cyber-archaeology is not applicable to some archaeological questions, it is particularly well suited to questions concerning long-term change, or “grand narratives.” Following this example is a theoretical introduction to grand narratives in archaeological theory. While long-term change fell out of fashion several decades ago, it has returned to the theoretical forefront, particularly in Mediterranean archaeology. The chapter ends with a brief introduction to each of the chapters in the volume.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Jones","given":"Ian W.

  {"id":"jones2020","abstract":"In this study, Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetric software was used to create 3D models of the Tyler house (Mound, TX) and Eyrie house (Holyoke, MA), both mid-19th century ruins. We compared the resulting models to evaluate the user experience for non-specialists between two different but popular software options for SfM modeling used by archaeologists. We addressed the differences in rendered models by acquisition method, UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) or terrestrial photography and, compared models using metric and interpretive outputs. We used AgiSoft’s PhotoScan (v. 1.4, now Metashape) and Autodesk ReCap Photo (v. 2018) to generate models for this study. Using CloudCompare (v.2.9.1), we calculated cloud-cloud distances, average distances between points, and the standard deviation between model pairs. Clouds were accurate to within 0.03 cm with varying degrees of standard deviation. This result is likely due to differences in methodology, such as the degree of photo overlap between acquisition methods and software rendering parameters. These results may help the archaeological community in selecting software, increasing awareness of point cloud and user-induced variations, and refining acquisition methods when recording archaeological sites. This paper is targeted towards informing non-specialists about options when selecting SfM software.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Jones","given":"Christine A."},{"family":"Church","given":"Elizabeth"}],"citation-key":"jones2020","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2020.102261","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"102261","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Photogrammetry is for everyone: Structure-from-motion software user experiences in archaeology","title-short":"Photogrammetry is for everyone","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X20300523","volume":"30"},

The challenge is to adopt appropriate descriptive levels and language to avoid falsely dividing agency and structure. Successful archaeological studies use networks and chains as models or metaphors for connections in sequences of action over time. We argue that models must also link micro-scale actions to outcomes on the macroscale. Because theories of agency differ in the degree of freedom of action they assume, archaeologists must also clearly identify their own position with respect to constraints on action.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Joyce","given":"Rosemary A."},{"family":"Lopiparo","given":"Jeanne"}],"citation-key":"joyce2005","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-005-8461-3","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"365-374","source":"link.springer.com","title":"PostScript: Doing Agency in Archaeology","title-short":"PostScript","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-005-8461-3","volume":"12"},

This article explores how these concepts have been developed and considers the implications of contemporary understandings of deposition and assemblage that depart significantly from conventional definitions, many still to be found in introductory text books. Conventionally, the term ‘assemblage’ is applied to a collection of artefacts or ecofacts recovered from a specific archaeological context — a site, an area within a site, a stratified deposit, or a specific feature such as a ditch, tomb, or house. This article further explains in details the histories of archaeological approaches followed by contemporary approaches. The conventional definitions of assemblage and deposition emerged from geological and processual models of archaeological ‘formation processes’ that developed from the nineteenth century through the mid-twentieth century.

The authors review the evidence for Palaeolithic seafaring in East Asia as the context for an experimental archaeology project to build two bamboo watercraft.

  {"id":"kaltenbrunner2021","abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the role of science and technology studies (STS) journal editors in organizing and maintaining the peer review economy. We specifically conceptualize peer review as a gift economy running on perpetually renewed experiences of mutual indebtedness among members of an intellectual community. While the peer review system is conventionally presented as self-regulating, we draw attention to its vulnerabilities and to the essential curating function of editors. Aside from inherent complexities, there are various shifts in the broader political–economic and sociotechnical organization of scholarly publishing that have recently made it more difficult for editors to organize robust cycles of gift exchange. This includes the increasing importance of journal metrics and associated changes in authorship practices; the growth and differentiation of the STS journal landscape; and changes in publishing funding models and the structure of the publishing market through which interactions among authors, editors, and reviewers are reconfigured. To maintain a functioning peer review economy in the face of numerous pressures, editors must balance contradictory imperatives: the need to triage intellectual production and rely on established cycles of gift exchange for efficiency, and the need to expand cycles of gift exchange to ensure the sustainability and diversity of the peer review economy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Kaltenbrunner","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Birch","given":"Kean"},{"family":"Amuchastegui","given":"Maria"}],"citation-key":"kaltenbrunner2021","container-title":"Science, Technology, & Human Values","container-title-short":"Science, Technology, & Human Values","DOI":"10.1177/01622439211068798","ISSN":"0162-2439","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,30]]},"language":"en","page":"01622439211068798","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Editorial Work and the Peer Review Economy of STS Journals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/01622439211068798"},

Lack of primary data publication is also a major obstacle to cultural heritage preservation and the goals of cultural resource management (CRM). Moreover, access to primary data is key to contesting claims about the past and to the formulation of credible alternative interpretations. In response to these concerns, experimental systems have implemented a variety of strategies to support online publication of primary data. Online data dissemination can be a powerful tool to meet the needs of CRM professionals, establish better communication and collaborative ties with colleagues in academic settings, and encourage public engagement with the documented record of the past. This paper introduces the ArchaeoML standard and its implementation in the Open Context system. As will be discussed, the integration and online dissemination of primary data offer great opportunities for making archaeological knowledge creation more participatory and transparent. However, different strategies in this area involve important trade-offs, and all face complex conceptual, ethical, legal, and professional challenges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Kansa","given":"Eric C."},{"family":"Whitcher Kansa","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Burton","given":"Margie M."},{"family":"Stankowski","given":"Cindy"}],"citation-key":"kansa2010a","container-title":"Archaeologies","container-title-short":"Arch","DOI":"10.1007/s11759-010-9146-4","ISSN":"1555-8622, 1935-3987","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"301-326","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Googling the Grey: Open Data, Web Services, and Semantics","title-short":"Googling the Grey","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11759-010-9146-4","volume":"6"},

Our discussion reports on how different editorial and collaborative review processes improved data documentation and quality, and created ontology annotations needed for comparative analyses by domain specialists. To prepare data for shared analysis, this project adapted editor-supervised review and revision processes familiar to conventional publishing, as well as more novel models of revision adapted from open source software development of public version control. Preparing the datasets for publication and analysis required significant investment of effort and expertise, including archaeological domain knowledge and familiarity with key ontologies. To organize this work effectively, we emphasized these different models of collaboration at various stages of this data publication and analysis project. Collaboration first centered on data editors working with data contributors, then widened to include other researchers who provided additional peer-review feedback, and finally the widest research community, whose collaboration is facilitated by GitHub’s version control system. We demonstrate that the “publish” and “push” models of data dissemination need not be mutually exclusive; on the contrary, they can play complementary roles in sharing high quality data in support of research.

  {"id":"kansa2021","abstract":"Digital data play an increasingly important role in how we understand the present and the past. The challenges inherent in understanding and using digital data are as intellectually demanding as any other archaeological research endeavor. For these reasons, data management cannot be regarded as a simple compliance or technical issue. For data to be meaningfully preserved and used in intellectually rigorous ways, they need to be integrated fully into all aspects of archaeological practice, including ethics, teaching, and publishing. In this review, we highlight some of the significant and multifaceted challenges involved in managing data, including documentation, training, methodology, data modeling, trust, and ethical concerns. We then focus on the importance of building data literacy broadly among archaeologists so that we can manage and communicate the data our discipline creates. This involves more than learning to use a new tool or finding a data manager for one's excavation or survey. Long-term, responsible stewardship of data requires understanding the workflows and human roles in data management. Putting effort now into thoughtful data management and broad data-literacy training means we will be able to make the most of the “bigger” data that archaeologists now produce. An important aspect of this reorientation will be to look beyond the boundaries of our own research projects and information systems. Future research, teaching, and public engagement needs will also compel us to explore how our data articulates with wider contexts—within and beyond our discipline.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Kansa","given":"Eric C."},{"family":"Whitcher Kansa","given":"Sarah"}],"citation-key":"kansa2021","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2020.55","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2]]},"language":"en","page":"81-85","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Digital Data and Data Literacy in Archaeology Now and in the New Decade","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/digital-data-and-data-literacy-in-archaeology-now-and-in-the-new-decade/588C941CDA91F91B10B8B676D7D1E1BA","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"katifori2020","abstract":"Visits to cultural heritage sites are generally social in nature, yet resources to support these sociable experiences are often individualized, catering to the solitary visitor. Digital technologies offer means to disrupt this predicament, encouraging social engagements in cultural contexts. Here we present the results of a user study that systematically investigates the effects of face-to-face group conversation and physical interactions within a digital cultural storytelling experience at the Neolithic site of Çatalhöyük, with the objective of promoting engagement, learning, and perspective taking. Seeking to articulate the benefits and weaknesses of promoting social interactions in digital storytelling settings, we start with a story-based experience that was designed for individual use, we extend it with novel system-driven interaction prompts, and then we evaluate the two versions with 102 participants. Our findings provide statistically significant evidence that conversation is related to longer and more absorbed participation in the experience and greater learning regardless of personality traits. Where social interaction is purposefully integrated into the story, more conversation is generated, and these interactive prompts do not disrupt the story flow even though participants report awareness of them. Finally, certain tendencies among users affect their talkativeness and enjoyment, providing future designers of digital stories with guidance to better address audience needs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Katifori","given":"Akrivi"},{"family":"Perry","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Vayanou","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Antoniou","given":"Angeliki"},{"family":"Ioannidis","given":"Ioannis-Panagiotis"},{"family":"McKinney","given":"Sierra"},{"family":"Chrysanthi","given":"Angeliki"},{"family":"Ioannidis","given":"Yannis"}],"citation-key":"katifori2020","container-title":"Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"kelle2005","abstract":"Since the late 1960s Barney GLASER and Anselm STRAUSS, developers of the methodology of \"Grounded Theory\" have made several attempts to explicate, clarify and reconceptualise some of the basic tenets of their methodological approach. Diverging concepts and understandings of Grounded Theory have arisen from these attempts which have led to a split between its founders. Much of the explication and reworking of Grounded Theory surrounds the relation between data and theory and the role of previous theoretical assumptions. The book which initially established the popularity of GLASER's and STRAUSS' methodological ideas, \"The Discovery of Grounded Theory\", contains two conflicting understandings of the relation between data and theory—the concept of \"emergence\" on the one hand and the concept of \"theoretical sensitivity\" on the other hand. Much of the later developments of Grounded Theory can be seen as attempts to reconcile these prima facie diverging concepts. Thereby GLASER recommends to draw on a variety of \"coding families\" while STRAUSS proposes the use of a general theory of action to build an axis for an emerging theory. This paper first summarises the most important developments within \"Grounded Theory\" concerning the understanding of the relation between empirical data and theoretical statements. Thereby special emphasis will be laid on differences between GLASER's and STRAUSS' concepts and on GLASER's current critique that the concepts of \"coding paradigm\" and \"axial coding\" described by STRAUSS and Juliet CORBIN lead to the \"forcing\" of data. It will be argued that GLASER's critique points out some existing weaknesses of STRAUSS' concepts but vastly exaggerates the risks of the STRAUSSian approach. A main argument of this paper is that basic problems of empirically grounded theory construction can be treated much more effectively if one draws on certain results of contemporary philosophical and epistemological discussions and on widely accepted concepts developed in such debates. This especially refers to the critique of naive empiricism, to the concept of hypothetical or abductive inference, to the concept of empirical content or falsifiability of statements and to the concept of corroboration.

The resulting distribution maps in turn serve to create archaeological maps for the prediction of areas with a high archaeological vulnerability potential. This predictive modelling also leads to the classification of archaeological-free areas. However, the fact that this spatial classification was created on the basis of an archaeological database, which in turn is strongly biased by find densities in modern agglomerations, leads to the potential destruction of archaeological monuments that are located in the invulnerable periphery. Such potential maps can only be sharpened by integrating a large number of different methodical concepts. This article presents the comprehensive combination of satellite remote sensing data, GIS-based landscape analyses and environmental data sets for the construction of a potentially holistic landscape scenario. Only with the highest possible information density of a large-scale study area can interactions in the geographical control factors be identified and conclusions be drawn on archaeological land-use and settlement concepts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Kempf","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"kempf2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.03.035","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,1]]},"page":"116-128","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The application of GIS and satellite imagery in archaeological land-use reconstruction: A predictive model?","title-short":"The application of GIS and satellite imagery in archaeological land-use reconstruction","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X19300860","volume":"25"},

The material manifestations (artifacts and samples) and the accompanying daily notes, digital records, maps, photographs, and plans together comprise a comprehensive record of the past. Once these items have been amassed, they are deposited in dig houses, magazines, museums, repositories, storage containers, and sometimes in personal basements and garages to be held in perpetuity. Across the globe, storage (here implying curation and permanent care) is one of the most pressing issues facing archaeology today. The following examines the curation crisis and some of the traditional and innovative solutions to the storage wars, arguing that rather than something that is viewed as a time-consuming, costly afterthought; curation should be an integral part of archaeological praxis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kersel","given":"Morag M."}],"citation-key":"kersel2015","container-title":"Journal of Eastern Mediterranean Archaeology & Heritage Studies","DOI":"10.5325/jeasmedarcherstu.3.1.0042","ISSN":"2166-3548","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"42-54","source":"JSTOR","title":"STORAGE WARS: Solving the Archaeological Curation Crisis?","title-short":"STORAGE WARS","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/jeasmedarcherstu.3.1.0042","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"kersel2020","abstract":"Looting of archaeological sites and thefts from cultural institutions in the Middle East is driven by an international demand for artifacts. Despite the efforts of Ministries of Culture, Departments of Antiquities, cultural heritage NGOs, and local communities, landscapes are destroyed, sites are pillaged, and museums are ransacked across the region. Like other countries, Jordan has a demand driven looting problem rooted in the legal and illegal trade in cultural material from the Middle East (Kersel 2019b). Tourists, locals, and museums desire Jordanian artifacts, often without questioning their market appearance. In addition to the standard set of approaches to physically and legally protecting their cultural heritage, Jordan recently turned to diplomatic measures to curb the illegal movement of looted and stolen materials. In order to support their request for a bilateral cultural property agreement with the United States, Jordan is using data from drones, databases, and archaeologists to prove that looting is an ongoing concern and the purloined artifacts are destined for the US. Deploying a case study based on data from drones, in the following we demonstrate the power of archaeological research in national policy formation and international diplomacy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Kersel","given":"Morag M."},{"family":"Hill","given":"Austin (Chad)"}],"citation-key":"kersel2020","container-title":"Journal of Field Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00934690.2020.1713282","ISSN":"0093-4690","issue":"sup1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,20]]},"page":"S101-S110","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Databases, Drones, Diggers, and Diplomacy: The Jordanian Request for a US Cultural Property Bilateral Agreement","title-short":"Databases, Drones, Diggers, and Diplomacy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00934690.2020.1713282","volume":"45"},

  {"id":"key2017","abstract":"Handaxes represent one of the most temporally enduring and geographically widespread of Palaeolithic artifacts and thus comprised a key technological strategy of many hominin populations. Archaeologically observable variation in the size (i.e., mass) and shape properties of handaxes has been frequently noted. It is logical to ask whether some of this variability may have had functional implications. Here, we report the results of a large-scale (n = 500 handaxes) experiment designed to examine the influence of variation in handaxe size and shape on cutting efficiency rates during a laboratory task. We used a comprehensive dataset of morphometric (size-adjusted) shape variables and statistical methods (including multivariate methods) to address this issue. Our first set of analyses focused on handaxe mass/size variability. This analysis demonstrated that, at a broad-scale level of variation, handaxe mass may have been free to vary independently of functional (cutting) efficiency. Our analysis also, however, identified that there will be a task-specific threshold in terms of functional effectiveness at the lower end of handaxe mass variation. This implies that hominins may have targeted design forms to meet minimal (task-specific) thresholds and may also have managed handaxe reduction and discard in respect to such factors. Our second set of analyses focused on handaxe shape variability. This analysis also indicated that considerable variation in handaxe shape may occur independently of any strong effect on cutting efficiency. We discuss how these results have several implications for considerations of handaxe variation in the archaeological record. At a general level, our results demonstrate that variability within and between handaxe assemblages in terms of their size and shape properties will not necessarily have had immediate or strong impact on their effectiveness when used for cutting, and that such variability may have been related to factors other than functional issues.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Key","given":"Alastair J.

  {"id":"key2019","abstract":"Both the form of a stone tool and the anatomy of the individual using it have potential to influence its cutting performance. To date, however, the selective pressures acting on stone-tool form and hominin biometric/biomechanical attributes have been investigated in isolation and their relative influence on performance have never been compared directly. This paper examines the influence of both tool-form attributes and biometric variation on the functional performance of Acheulean handaxes. Specifically, it investigates the impact of 13 tool attributes and eight biometric traits on the working forces applied through the edge of 457 replica tools. The relative contribution of tool-form and biometric attributes to handaxe loading levels were examined statistically. Results identify that both tool-form attributes and biometric traits are significantly related to loading; however, tool–user biometric variation has a substantially greater impact relative to tool-form attributes. This difference was demonstrated by up to a factor of 10. These results bear directly on the co-evolutionary relationships of stone tools and hominin anatomy, and the comparative strength of selective pressure acting on each. They also underline why handaxe forms may have been free to vary in form across time and space without necessarily incurring critical impacts on their functional capabilities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Key","given":"A.

Informational videos about archaeology may not be promoted on everyone's personalized home page—called the For You page (FYP)—but they are easily accessible through the search function. This review will discuss the impact TikTok has on the world of archaeology, with a focus on public engagement, museums, and especially teaching and learning. The social power of this app needs to be acknowledged. Archaeology can introduce the public to snapshots of daily life from the past, a task that fits well with the design of TikTok.

  {"id":"khan2024","abstract":"This paper reflects upon calls for \"open data\" in ethnography, drawing on our experiences doing research on sexual violence. The core claim of this paper is not that open data is undesirable; it is that there is a lot we must know before we presume its benefits apply to ethnographic research. The epistemic and ontological foundation of open data is grounded in a logic that is not always consistent with that of ethnographic practice. We begin by identifying three logics of open dataepistemic, political-economic, and regulatory-which each address a perceived problem with knowledge production and point to open science as the solution. We then evaluate these logics in the context of the practice of ethnographic research. Claims that open data would improve data quality are, in our assessment, potentially reversed: in our own ethnographic work, open data practices would likely have compromised our data quality. And protecting subject identities would have meant creating accessible data that would not allow for replication. For ethnographic work, open data would be like having the data set without the codebook. Before we adopt open data to improve the quality of science, we need to answer a series of questions about what open data does to data quality. Rather than blindly make a normative commitment to a principle, we need empirical work on the impact of such practices -work which must be done with respect to the different epistemic cultures' modes of inquiry. Ethnographers, as well as the institutions that fund and regulate ethnographic research, should only embrace open data after the subject has been researched and evaluated within our own epistemic community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Khan","given":"Shamus"},{"family":"Hirsch","given":"Jennifer S."},{"family":"Zeltzer-Zubida","given":"Ohad"}],"citation-key":"khan2024","container-title":"Frontiers in Sociology","container-title-short":"Front.

The approach utilizes qualitative and ethnographic research methods to gather data on practitioners’ reasoning and knowledge practices.

In addition, given the variety, quantity and scale of archaeological evidence, information technology is a central component of current archaeological practice. This situation provides an excellent case study for the interplay between Information and Communication technologies (ICTs) and institutional and cultural context. This paper reports on a work in progress that examines the role ICTs play in the construction of archaeological knowledge in practice, which focuses on the processes of data recording and information organization. This study uses the conceptual lens of Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and explores important socio-technical aspects of the development of information systems in archaeology. The socio-technical challenges of information recording are conceptualized as practice fault-lines. Three fault-lines of information recording in archaeology are recognized and presented in this paper: 1) Within community vs. cross-community practices; 2) Data management vs. data analysis; 3) Information system designers vs. archaeology practitioners. Recognition of these fault-lines has substantial implications for the design of information organization technologies for collaborative practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Khazraee","given":"Emad"}],"citation-key":"khazraee2013","DOI":"10.9776/13246","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",2]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2013 is held by the authors.

We conceptualize a network of practice as a nexus of interconnected practice, formed around materially mediated interdependencies across communities of practice. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork of archaeology research, conducted across multiple research disciplines and communities of practice, we identify the material components of embedded information and explicate the processes by which objectual and social practices shape the adoption of theories across the network, creating knowledge-in-practice. We conceptualize knowledge construction as a product of the constant tension between contextualization and decontextualization (embeddedness and disembeddedness). Our findings demonstrate the mechanisms by which exploratory interactions with the information embedded in things (research objects) produce breakdowns that reveal inconsistencies within current theories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Khazraee","given":"Emad"},{"family":"Gasson","given":"Susan"}],"citation-key":"khazraee2015","container-title":"The Information Society","DOI":"10.1080/01972243.2015.998104","ISSN":"0197-2243","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,15]]},"page":"139-159","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Epistemic Objects and Embeddedness: Knowledge Construction and Narratives in Research Networks of Practice","title-short":"Epistemic Objects and Embeddedness","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01972243.2015.998104","volume":"31"},

New methods of analysis have allowed archaeologists to pose many new questions, and have made it possible to revisit many old ones. In spite of its many successes, archaeological science is not yet a mature field of science, for it has yet to attract adequate funding, has not solved the problem of how to reproduce itself (issues of training and employment), and still struggles with quality control. These are however all problems of archaeological science in rich nations. Looking beyond these, a particularly troubling issue is the growing inequality of access to archaeological science. Archaeologists in poorer nations are often aware of the growing importance of scientific techniques in archaeological research, but cannot obtain access to them.

  {"id":"kintigh2014","abstract":"Abstract This article represents a systematic effort to answer the question, What are archaeology’s most important scientific challenges? Starting with a crowd-sourced query directed broadly to the professional community of archaeologists, the authors augmented, prioritized, and refined the responses during a two-day workshop focused specifically on this question. The resulting 25 “grand challenges” focus on dynamic cultural processes and the operation of coupled human and natural systems. We organize these challenges into five topics: (1) emergence, communities, and complexity; (2) resilience, persistence, transformation, and collapse; (3) movement, mobility, and migration; (4) cognition, behavior, and identity; and (5) human-environment interactions. A discussion and a brief list of references accompany each question. An important goal in identifying these challenges is to inform decisions on infrastructure investments for archaeology. Our premise is that the highest priority investments should enable us to address the most important questions. Addressing many of these challenges will require both sophisticated modeling and large-scale synthetic research that are only now becoming possible. Although new archaeological fieldwork will be essential, the greatest pay off will derive from investments that provide sophisticated research access to the explosion in systematically collected archaeological data that has occurred over the last several decades. , Resumen Este artículo representa un esfuerzo sistemático para responder a la pregunta: ¿Cuáles son los retos científícos más importantes de la arqueología?

  {"id":"kintigh2015","abstract":"Archaeological data and research results are essential to addressing such fundamental questions as the origins of human culture; the origin, waxing, and waning of civilizations and cities; the response of societies to long-term climate changes; and the systemic relationships implicated in human-induced changes in the environment. However, we lack the capacity for acquiring, managing, analyzing, and synthesizing the data sets needed to address important questions such as these. We propose investments in computational infrastructure that would transform archaeology’s ability to advance research on the field’s most compelling questions with an evidential base and inferential rigor that have heretofore been impossible. At the same time, new infrastructure would make archaeological data accessible to researchers in other disciplines. We offer recommendations regarding data management and availability, cyberinfrastructure tool building, and social and cultural changes in the discipline. We propose funding synthetic case studies that would demonstrate archaeology’s ability to contribute to transdisciplinary research on long-term social dynamics and serve as a context for developing computational tools and analytical workflows that will be necessary to attack these questions. The case studies would explore how emerging research in computer science could empower this research and would simultaneously provide productive challenges for computer science research. , Los datos y resultados de la investigación arqueológica son esenciales para abordar cuestiones tan fundamentales como los orígenes de la cultura humana; el origen, crecimiento y decadencia de las civilizaciones y ciudades; la respuesta de las sociedades a los cambios climáticos a largo plazo y las relaciones sistémicas involucradas en los cambios antropogénicos en el medio ambiente. Sin embargo, carecemos de la capacidad para adquirir, administrar, analizar y sintetizar los conjuntos de datos necesarios para abordar cuestiones importantes como estas. En este trabajo proponemos que las inversiones en infraestructura computacional tienen la capacidad de transformar la habilidad de la arqueología para desarrollar la investigación en torno a las cuestiones más apremiantes de este campo con una base empírica y bajo el rigor de la inferencia científica que hasta ahora habían sido imposibles de lograr. Al mismo tiempo, la nueva infraestructura facilitaría el acceso a los datos arqueológicos a investigadores de otras disciplinas.

In order to do this: 1) We describe a method that permits the objective identification of climate extremes in a way that is independent of their supposed causal outcomes; 2) We discuss how we identify and date cultural transitions of interest; 3) We explore a variety of decision rules for determining whether or not there is a match between a given extreme climate interval and the interval during which a transition began; and 4) We propose an intuitive Monte Carlo approach to statistically assess the observed correspondence between the climate extremes and the cultural transitions.

  {"id":"kintigh2018a","abstract":"Addressing archaeology's most compelling substantive challenges requires synthetic research that exploits the large and rapidly expanding corpus of systematically collected archaeological data. That, in turn, requires a means of combining datasets that employ different systematics in their recording while at the same time preserving the semantics of the data. To that end, we have developed a general procedure that we call query-driven, on-the-fly data integration that is deployed within the Digital Archaeological Record digital repository. The integration procedure employs ontologies that are mapped to the original datasets. Integration of the ontology-based dataset representations is done at the time the query is executed, based on the specific content of the query. In this way, the original data are preserved, and data are aggregated only to the extent necessary to obtain semantic comparability. Our presentation draws examples from the largest application to date: an effort by a research community of Southwest US faunal analysts. Using 24 ontologies developed to cover a broad range of observed faunal variables, we integrate faunal data from 33 sites across the late prehistoric northern Southwest, including about 300,000 individually recorded faunal specimens.\n, \nAbordar los retos sustantivos más convincentes de la arqueología requiere una investigación sintética que explote el corpus grande y rápidamente en expansión de datos arqueológicos recopilados sistemáticamente. Esto, a su vez, requiere un medio de combinar conjuntos de datos que empleen sistemática diferente en su grabación mientras que al mismo tiempo preserva la semántica de los datos. Para ello, hemos desarrollado un procedimiento general que denominamos integración de datos en tiempo real basada en consultas, que se despliega dentro del repositorio digital el Digital Archaeological Record. El procedimiento de integración emplea ontologías que se asignan a los conjuntos de datos originales. La integración de las representaciones de conjuntos de datos basados en ontología se realiza en el momento en que se ejecuta la consulta, en función del contenido específico de la consulta.

Critical data studies endeavours to answer such questions.  This paper sets out a vision for critical data studies, building on the initial provocations of Dalton and Thatcher (2014).  It is divided into three sections.  The first details the recent step change in the production and employment of data and how data and databases are being reconceptualised.  The second forwards the notion of a data assemblage that encompasses all of the technological, political, social and economic apparatuses and elements that constitutes and frames the generation, circulation and deployment of data.  Drawing on the ideas of Michel Foucault and Ian Hacking it is posited that one way to enact critical data studies is to chart and unpack data assemblages.  The third starts to unpack some the ways that data assemblages do work in the world with respect to dataveillance and the erosion of privacy, profiling and social sorting, anticipatory governance, and secondary uses and control creep.  The paper concludes by arguing for greater conceptual work and empirical research to underpin and flesh out critical data studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Kitchin","given":"Rob"},{"family":"Lauriault","given":"Tracey"}],"citation-key":"kitchin2014","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",7,30]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Towards Critical Data Studies: Charting and Unpacking Data Assemblages and Their Work","title-short":"Towards Critical Data Studies","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2474112"},

We illustrate how to use structural causal models to conduct causal inference using regression models based on simulated data of a hypothetical structural causal model of Open Science.

  {"id":"klehm2021","abstract":"Chronic diseases and preexisting conditions shape daily life for many archaeologists both in and out of the field. Chronic issues, however, can be overlooked in safety planning, which more often focuses on emergency situations because they are considered mundane, or they are imperceptible to project directors and crews until a serious problem arises. This article focuses on asthma, diabetes, and depression as common medical conditions that impact otherwise healthy archaeologists during fieldwork, with the goal of raising awareness of these conditions in particular, and the need to be more attentive to chronic diseases in general. Archaeological fieldwork presents novel situations that put those with chronic diseases and preexisting conditions at risk: environmental hazards, remoteness from medical and social resources and networks, lack of group awareness, and varying cultural norms. As a result, if chronic diseases are not attended to properly in the field, they can lead to life-threatening situations. Managing the risk presented by these conditions requires a group culture where team members are aware of issues, as appropriate, and collaborate to mitigate them during fieldwork. Descriptions of how chronic diseases affect archaeologists in the field are followed by “best practice” recommendations for self-management and for group leaders.\n, \nLas enfermedades crónicas y las condiciones preexistentes son parte de la vida diaria de muchos arqueólogos, tanto dentro como fuera del campo. Sin embargo, los problemas crónicos pueden obviarse en la planificación de seguridad, pues esta se limita a situaciones de emergencia, por lo que estos problemas resultan triviales e imperceptibles para los directores de proyectos y los equipos hasta que surge un problema grave. Este artículo se enfoca en el asma, la diabetes y la depresión como afecciones médicas comunes que impactan a los arqueólogos, por lo demás saludables, durante el trabajo de campo, con el objetivo de crear conciencia sobre estas afecciones en particular y la necesidad de dar importancia a las enfermedades crónicas en general. El trabajo de campo arqueológico presenta situaciones inusuales que ponen en riesgo a quienes padecen enfermedades crónicas y condiciones preexistentes: peligros ambientales, lejanía de recursos y redes médicas y sociales, falta de conciencia de grupo y normas culturales variables. Como resultado, si las necesidades de tratamiento para el asma, la diabetes y la depresión no son atendidas adecuadamente en el campo, pueden provocar situaciones que pongan en riesgo la vida. La gestión de riesgo que conllevan estas condiciones requiere de una cultura grupal en que los miembros del equipo sean conscientes de los problemas, según corresponda, y colaboren para mitigarlos durante el trabajo de campo. Las descripciones de cómo estas condiciones afectan a los arqueólogos en el campo van seguidas de recomendaciones de “buenas prácticas” para la autogestión y para los líderes de grupo.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Klehm","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Hildebrand","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Meyers","given":"Maureen S."}],"citation-key":"klehm2021","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2020.49","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2]]},"language":"en","page":"41-48","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Mitigating Chronic Diseases during Archaeological Fieldwork: Lessons from Managing Asthma, Diabetes, and Depression","title-short":"Mitigating Chronic Diseases during Archaeological Fieldwork","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/abs/mitigating-chronic-diseases-during-archaeological-fieldwork/9370E490BDCEC8EB261FC18051A9FED5","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"klehm2023","abstract":"Spatial data, under the broader umbrella of digital data, is becoming increasingly integral to all stages of archaeological research design and dissemination. As archaeologists lean toward reuse and interoperability, with ethics on their minds, how to treat spatial data is of particular importance. This is because of the complexities involved at every life-cycle stage, from collection to publication, including black box issues that may be taken for granted, and because the size of spatial data can lead to archiving difficulties. Here, the “DIY” momentum of increasingly accessible spatial methods such as photogrammetry and handheld lidar is examined alongside forthcoming changes in publication policies that will impact the United States in particular, framed around a conversation about best practices and a call for more comprehensive training for the archaeological community. At its heart, this special issue seeks to realize the potential of increasingly digitized—and increasingly large amounts of—archaeological data. Within cultural resource management, this means anticipating utilization of data through widespread standardization, among many interrelated activities. A desire to enhance the utility of archaeological data has distinct resonances with the use of spatial data in archaeology, as do some wider challenges that the archaeological community faces moving forward.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Klehm","given":"Carla"}],"citation-key":"klehm2023","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2022.38","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2]]},"language":"en","page":"104-110","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"The Use and Challenges of Spatial Data in Archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/use-and-challenges-of-spatial-data-in-archaeology/0183B6E802E839A973CD7D3FE72389F6","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"klein2018","abstract":"Over the past several years, we have seen many attacks on publicly funded and mandated archaeology in the United States. These attacks occur at the state level, where governors and state legislatures try to defund or outright eliminate state archaeological programs and institutions. We have also seen several attacks at the federal level. Some members of Congress showcase archaeology as a waste of public tax dollars, and others propose legislation to move federally funded or permitted projects forward without consideration of impacts on archaeological resources. These attacks continue to occur, and we expect them to increase in the future. In the past, a vigilant network of historic preservation and archaeological organizations was able to thwart such attacks. The public, however, largely remains an untapped ally. As a discipline, we have not built a strong public support network. We have not demonstrated the value of archaeology to the public, beyond a scattering of educational and informational programs.

We begin by examining the perspectives of individual surgeons and lecturers and the relational, organizational, and institutional settings in which they are embedded. Recognizing and emphasizing the idiosyncrasies of these cases, we develop theoretical lenses that allow us to identify the dynamics of the transformation and patterns in reconfiguration work. To investigate these illustrative cases of digital work and their implications, we employ two conceptual frames, 1) configuration work (Suchman, 2012), specifically emergent configurations of digital-human work, and 2) orders of change (Bartunek & Moch, 1987), emphasizing the role and development of frameworks in making sense of organizational change. We thus combine multi-faceted accounts of individuals' experiences of “figuring out” how to make digital work feasible with reflections on how the transformation of work affects the identities of individuals, organizations, and institutions. We propose that this transformation affects the ways in which we think about ourselves, our colleagues and employers, and the institutions that shape our work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Klein","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Watson-Manheim","given":"Mary Beth"}],"citation-key":"klein2021","container-title":"Information and Organization","container-title-short":"Information and Organization","DOI":"10.1016/j.infoandorg.2021.100377","ISSN":"1471-7727","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,19]]},"language":"en","page":"100377","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The (re-)configuration of digital work in the wake of profound technological innovation: Constellations and hidden work","title-short":"The (re-)configuration of digital work in the wake of profound technological innovation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471772721000439"},

Five major propositions that web analysts essentially make about the dynamics of computing development and use are also presented. The chapter concludes by examining two additional cases of computer developmentand use. It is noted that web models allow better predictions of the outcomes of using socially-complex computing developments in contrast to the discrete-entity models.

Unfortunately, much of the literature about scholarly e-publishing homogenizes the character of publishing. This article provides an analytical approach for evaluating disciplinary conventions and for proposing policies about scholarly e-publishing. We characterize three dimensions of scholarly publishing as a communicative practice—publicity, access, and trustworthiness—and examine several forms of paper and electronic publications in this framework. This analysis shows how the common claim that e-publishing “substantially expands access” is oversimplified.

  {"id":"kling2000","abstract":"The shift towards the use of electronic media in scholarly communication appears to be an inescapable imperative. However, these shifts are uneven, both with respect to field and with respect to the form of communication. Different scientific fields have developed and use distinctly different communicative forums, both in the paper and electronic arenas, and these forums play different communicative roles within the field. One common claim is that we are in the early stages of an electronic revolution, that it is only a matter of time before other fields catch up with the early adopters, and that all fields converge on a stable set of electronic forums. A social shaping of technology (SST) perspective helps us to identify important social forces—centered around disciplinary constructions of trust and of legitimate communication—that pull against convergence. This analysis concludes that communicative plurality and communicative heterogeneity are durable features of the scholarly landscape, and that we are likely to see field differences in the use of and meaning ascribed to communications forums persist, even as overall use of electronic communications technologies both in science and in society as a whole increases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Kling","given":"Rob"},{"family":"McKim","given":"Geoffrey"}],"citation-key":"kling2000","container-title":"Journal of the American Society for Information Science","DOI":"10.1002/1097-4571(2000)9999:9999<::AID-ASI1047>3.0.CO;2-T","ISSN":"1097-4571","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","page":"1306-1320","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Not just a matter of time: Field differences and the shaping of electronic media in supporting scientific communication","title-short":"Not just a matter of time","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1097-4571%282000%299999%3A9999%3C%3A%3AAID-ASI1047%3E3.0.CO%3B2-T","volume":"51"},

  {"id":"knapp1996","abstract":"Interdisciplinary approaches to the study of the past and the present have become commonplace: anthropologists now situate cultures in their historical contexts, while historians pursue particularistic ends within politicoeconomic or ideational structures. Archaeologists have cast their nets even more widely, not only toward anthropology and history, but to fields ranging from molecular biology to hermeneutics. Postmodernist approaches maintain that archaeologists should be looking at the past from multiple perspectives and listening to its multivocality. Archaeologists, in fact, not only develop different ways of understanding the past, but actually develop alternative pasts. This paper argues that multiple paths to alternative pasts enhance archaeological understanding and, at the same time, stimulate the development of archaeological theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Knapp","given":"A.

  {"id":"knapp1998","abstract":"Introduction\n\nAcross the spectrum of contemporary archaeology, few would deny that political realities impact powerfully and often negatively on both archaeological practice and archaeological interpretation. We hear more and more of archaeology's role in the construction and legitimisation of cultural or ethnic identity, and of the destruction, sale and obliteration of archaeological pasts from their modern cultural contexts. Such 'cultural cleansing' is nourished by the consequences of war, nationalistic fervour, inter-ethnic conflict, and the illicit and universally condemned trade in antiquities. In these situations, political neutrality is unachievable and can no longer be condoned by archaeologists (Pollock 1992:301–4).","author":[{"family":"Knapp","given":"A.

  {"id":"knapp2008","abstract":"Archaeologists who seek to examine people's roles in past societies have long assumed, consciously or unconsciously, the existence of individuals. In this study, we explore various concepts and dimensions of ‘the individual’, both ethnographic and archaeological. We show that many protagonists in the debate over the existence of ‘individuals’ in prehistory use the same ethnographic examples to argue their positions. These positions range from the claim that any suggestion of individuals prior to 500 years ago simply projects a construct of western modernity onto the past, to the view that individual identities are culturally specific social constructs, both past and present. Like most contributors to the debate, we too are sceptical of an unchanging humanity in the past, but we feel that thinking on the topic has become somewhat inflexible. As a counterpoint to this debate, therefore, we discuss Bourdieu's concept of habitus in association with Foucault's notion of power. We conclude that experiencing oneself as a living individual is part of human nature, and that archaeologists should reconsider the individual's social, spatial and ideological importance, as well as the existence of individual, embodied lives in prehistoric as well as historical contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Knapp","given":"A.

  {"id":"knappett2011a","abstract":"Material culture surrounds us and yet is habitually overlooked. So integral is it to our everyday lives that we take it for granted. This attitude has also afflicted the academic analysis of material culture, although this is now beginning to change, with material culture recently emerging as a topic in its own right within the social sciences. Carl Knappett seeks to contribute to this emergent field by adopting a wide-ranging interdisciplinary approach that is rooted in archaeology and integrates anthropology, sociology, art history, semiotics, psychology, and cognitive science. His thesis is that humans both act and think through material culture; ways of knowing and ways of doing are ingrained within even the most mundane of objects. This requires that we adopt a relational perspective on material artifacts and human agents, as a means of characterizing their complex interdependencies. In order to illustrate the networks of meaning that result, Knappett discusses examples ranging from prehistoric Aegean ceramics to Zande hunting nets and contemporary art.Thinking Through Material Culture argues that, although material culture forms the bedrock of archaeology, the discipline has barely begun to address how fundamental artifacts are to human cognition and perception. This idea of codependency among mind, action, and matter opens the way for a novel and dynamic approach to all of material culture, both past and present.","author":[{"family":"Knappett","given":"Carl"}],"citation-key":"knappett2011a","ISBN":"978-0-8122-0249-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",1,1]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"213","publisher":"University of Pennsylvania Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Thinking Through Material Culture: An Interdisciplinary Perspective","title-short":"Thinking Through Material Culture","type":"book"},

The considerable potential for multiscalar analysis has recently seen some progress, however, wedded to the idea of communities of practice. In this paper, I consider how this multiscalar approach could aid in the study of ancient globalizations, with the particular case of Minoanization from the Aegean Bronze Age. Although this specific problem has seen some network applications, they have mostly not been multiscalar in nature. I address some of the reasons for this state of affairs, using a distinction between “theory” and “data” models—and suggest some possible outcomes of a more explicitly multiscalar approach to Minoanization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Knappett","given":"Carl"}],"citation-key":"knappett2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-018-9396-9","ISSN":"1573-7764","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"974-995","source":"Springer Link","title":"From Network Connectivity to Human Mobility: Models for Minoanization","title-short":"From Network Connectivity to Human Mobility","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-018-9396-9","volume":"25"},

We primarily discuss the virtue and equity programmes and through interrogating both reform programmes in relation to the Reformation, we seek to display the relevance of sociopolitical contexts for how key values operate in science and how they generate orders of worth.

  {"id":"knoll2019","abstract":"With the advent of commercially available digital cameras in the late 1990s resulting in the near-exclusion of analog photographic prints today, most archaeological repositories around the world have a mix of analog and digital photographic prints. That ratio is increasingly moving toward digital print processes, of which there are several types. To minimize the loss of image quality, collection managers must become familiar with the unique curation challenges of photographic prints from digitally created images. Likewise, creators of digital content must be aware that choices made when selecting a print process for reposit will have a direct effect on image and print permanence. Site photographs are critical evidence of archaeological activity, and so the preservation of digital prints is in the interest, and is the responsibility, of collection managers and archaeologists alike., Con la llegada de las cámaras digitales comerciales a finales de los años noventa, se eliminó casi por completo la impresión fotográfica analógica o tradicional.

In this book, Karin Knorr Cetina compares two of the most important and intriguing epistemic cultures of our day, those in high energy physics and molecular biology. Her work highlights the diversity of these cultures of knowing and, in its depiction of their differences–in the meaning of the empirical, the enactment of object relations, and the fashioning of social relations–challenges the accepted view of a unified science. By many accounts, contemporary Western societies are becoming \"knowledge societies\"–which run on expert processes and expert systems epitomized by science and structured into all areas of social life. By looking at epistemic cultures in two sample cases, this book addresses pressing questions about how such expert systems and processes work, what principles inform their cognitive and procedural orientations, and whether their organization, structures, and operations can be extended to other forms of social order. The first ethnographic study to systematically compare two different scientific laboratory cultures, this book sharpens our focus on epistemic cultures as the basis of the knowledge society.","author":[{"family":"Knorr Cetina","given":"Karin"}],"citation-key":"knorrcetina1999","ISBN":"978-0-674-25894-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"language":"english","number-of-pages":"329","publisher":"Harvard University Press","title":"Epistemic Cultures: How the Sciences Make Knowledge","title-short":"Epistemic Cultures","type":"book"},

It is a quick way to survey large areas, but requires a lot of error-prone human work to analyze it afterwards.

  {"id":"koenig2017","abstract":"The accurate and precise collection of three-dimensional (3D) context and provenience data is of critical importance for archaeologists. Traditional square-hole methods are being augmented by new digital techniques to increase the accuracy and precision with which 3D data are collected. Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry is an emerging digital technique that is becoming more widespread for collecting 3D data of archaeological sites and features. We are using handheld digital cameras and ground-based SfM to record accurate and precise 3D context and provenience data at the scale of the excavation unit and profile during rockshelter excavations in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands of Texas. By combining SfM with traditional excavation methods, we collect 3D data on excavation units, layers, features, and profiles without excavating in grid-bound square units. SfM provides a straightforward and flexible method to excavate based on the stratigraphy and logistical pragmatics, which further aids in assigning precise context and provenience to recovered artifacts and samples. This article describes how ground-based SfM serves as a basic recording tool during excavation and shows that, by applying ground-based SfM methods to excavation, archaeologists can collect more, and more accurate, data than with traditional square-hole methods.\n, \nLa colección exacta y precisa del contexto y de los datos de procedencia en tres dimensiones (3D) de objetos y rasgos es de importancia crítica para la arqueología. Los métodos tradicionales a base de unidades cuadradas están siendo aumentados por nuevas técnicas digitales que tienen el objetivo de mejorar la exactitud y la precisión con las que se recogen los datos en 3D. La fotogrametría de estructura a partir del movimiento (Structure from Motion; SfM) es una técnica digital emergente que está cada vez más generalizada para recoger datos en 3D de sitios y rasgos arqueológicos. Utilizamos cámaras digitales portátiles con SfM terrestre para registrar los datos en 3D exactos y precisos de contexto y procedencia a la escala de la unidad de excavación y del perfil durante las excavaciones de abrigos rocosos en los cañones del Lower Pecos, Texas. Mediante la combinación de SfM con los métodos de excavación tradicionales, recogemos los datos en 3D de unidades de excavación, capas, rasgos y perfiles sin excavar en unidades limitadas por una cuadricula tradicional. La SfM proporciona un método sencillo y flexible para excavar basado en la estratigrafía y las consideraciones prácticas, lo que ayuda aún más la asignación de contexto preciso y procedencia a los materiales culturales y muestras recuperados. En este artículo se describe como la SfM terrestre sirve como una herramienta básica de grabación durante la excavación, y como por medio de la aplicación de métodos de SfM terrestre a la excavación, los arqueólogos pueden recoger datos más abundantes, y más precisos, de lo que se puede recoger con los métodos tradicionales usando las unidades de excavación cuadradas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Koenig","given":"Charles W."},{"family":"Willis","given":"Mark D."},{"family":"Black","given":"Stephen L."}],"citation-key":"koenig2017","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2016.8","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",2]]},"language":"en","page":"54-70","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Beyond the Square Hole: Application of Structure from Motion Photogrammetry to Archaeological Excavation","title-short":"Beyond the Square Hole","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/beyond-the-square-hole/2711002AEEC4F71E235D2C56C6D8DEFB","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"koolen2020","abstract":"Since the appearance of digital research infrastructures in the humanities in the last decade, important efforts are being made to understand and model scholarly processes. Different methods are used in those investigations, which often result in abstract representations of research phases, taxonomies of scholarly activities, in conceptual frameworks, or in scholarly ontologies. While the aim of these representations is to inform the design of the digital infrastructures, the complexity and diversity of scholarly work pose the question about the applicability of those models for design and evaluation of research infrastructures and tools. In this paper, we explore a methodology to analyze workflows from a micro-perspective, which aims at capturing the transitions between activities. We use two scholarly projects as case studies, describe their research activities in detail by using existing ontologies and describe the connections between activities, and analyse generic transitions. We discuss what kinds of implications this approach has to evaluation and design of information systems and services to facilitate scholars' complex and varied research processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Koolen","given":"Marijn"},{"family":"Kumpulainen","given":"Sanna"},{"family":"Melgar-Estrada","given":"Liliana"}],"citation-key":"koolen2020","collection-title":"CHIIR '20","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval","DOI":"10.1145/3343413.3377969","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-6892-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,14]]},"page":"183–192","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"A Workflow Analysis Perspective to Scholarly Research Tasks","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3343413.3377969"},

  {"id":"kot2024","abstract":"One of the methods of analysing the manufacturing process of lithic tools is by “reading” the scars of removals visible on the surface of cores or bifaces. The paper aims to review the limitations of this approach, by answering the question as to how much information from the original knapping process is still preserved in the cores and bifaces. To quantify the information loss we used experimentally knapped pieces, that we then refitted to check which removals are still visible on the surface of the analysed forms. We tested different measures of information loss in the context of removals and sequences of removals, but also the chronological relationship between sequences i.e. the number of linear extensions and missing nearest connections. On average, 39.9% of the original removals and 54.1% of the sequences of removals are preserved on the surface, but only 14.1% of the original relationships between sequences can be observed. Finally, we used simple machine learning to find an algorithm for estimating the loss of the nearest chronological relationships between sequences when no refits are available. Due to the extremely high information loss for the linear order of the knapping process we: a) propose to abandon these elements of the diacritic approach which aim to reconstruct the rhythms and schemes of knapping; b) evaluate the quality of the reconstructed knapping scheme (partial order) prior to further comparative analyses. Here we propose an algorithm to estimate the number of missing connections to test the quality of the knapping process while using diacritic schemes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Kot","given":"Małgorzata"},{"family":"Tyszkiewicz","given":"Jerzy"},{"family":"Gryczewska","given":"Natalia"}],"citation-key":"kot2024","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2023.105905","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,1]]},"page":"105905","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Can we read stones?

  {"id":"kowalczyk2016","abstract":"Swede Hollow Park, in St. Paul, Minnesota, was originally inhabited by immigrants to St. Paul. Despite an engaged surrounding neighborhood, the park and its history are not widely known. The park was recently the site of a public archaeology project, providing an opportunity to explicitly examine who participated and why, as a means of assessing the success of public education. The project team used surveys and informal interviews as assessment tools for analyzing the demographics and motivations of the participating public. Understanding demographics and motivations is an understudied aspect of public archaeology and yet is crucially important in influencing how archaeologists interact with the public, frame their research questions, and create learning objectives. This information has the potential to help create more inclusive public archaeology projects (for example, drawing in more recent immigrant communities as well as descendants) and to indicate where more work needs to be done to accommodate diversity (in our case, understanding the homeless as stakeholders). It also can help clarify whether archaeologists can, or should, prioritize site, method, or narrative when engaging with the public, or whether the public should choose.\n, \nResumen\nOriginalmente Swede Hollow Park fue habitado por los inmigrantes del área de St. Paul, Minnesota.

Se dio la oportunidad para explorar explícitamente quienes participaron y por qué, en vez de solamente incluir el objetivo de entregar con éxito la información. Se invitó a los participantes a contribuir en las excavaciones y se les pidió llenar una encuesta y/o participar en una entrevista informal. Se utilizaron encuestas de opción múltiple para evaluar lo que los participantes habían aprendido acerca de la arqueología y/o la historia del parque y por qué ellos habían participado. Se utilizaron las entrevistas para comprender más profundamente por qué la gente había elegido participar. Los resultados indican que la mayoría de las personas participaron por las mismas razones: muchos sintieron que era importante aprender sobre la historia de la inmigración, mientras que otros buscaron aprender más acerca de la arqueología o la historia del barrio. Aplicar esta información para otros proyectos de arqueología pública puede ayudar a aclarar si los arqueólogos pueden, o deben, dar prioridad al sitio, al método o a la narrativa al hacer participar al público, o si el público debe elegir.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Kowalczyk","given":"Stefanie"}],"citation-key":"kowalczyk2016","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.7183/2326-3768.4.4.454","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11]]},"language":"en","page":"454-464","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Excavating the “Who” and “Why” of Participation in a Public Archaeology Project","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/excavating-the-who-and-why-of-participation-in-a-public-archaeology-project/1B7249629C3D8EF37588E661F0819404","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"kristiansen2009","abstract":"In a previous discussion article, ‘Do we need “the archaeology of Europe”?’ (Kristiansen 2008), I argued that, although a European archaeology is being promoted by both the European Association of Archaeologists and the European conventions, such as the Valletta Convention of 1992 and the European Landscape Convention of 2000, there are still more divergences than commonalities, due to the strong national organization of archaeology in Europe. I especially considered archaeological heritage terminology, the language of references in books and journals, and the structure of archaeological journals which all pointed to an increasing national focus of archaeological research and publications. In this article I take a closer look at the structure of developer-funded excavations, or contract archaeology, in Europe. I argue that contract archaeology represents a laboratory for the testing of different principles of organization, control and quality assessments. Although the Valletta Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage stipulates the basic principles of developer-funded rescue archaeology, its implementation since 1992 among the European nations, and indeed also among the regions within nations, such as the federal states (landes) in Germany, varies dramatically. By analysing a few ‘model countries’ I demonstrate that this variation comes down to, and originates from, two basically different political principles: that of ‘socialism’ and that of ‘capitalism’ (following Willems and van den Dries 2007b). As they have different implications for quality control and research the choice of one or the other has far-reaching consequences for the future of archaeology in Europe.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Kristiansen","given":"Kristian"}],"citation-key":"kristiansen2009","container-title":"World Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00438240903371486","ISSN":"0043-8243","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",12,1]]},"page":"641-648","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Contract archaeology in Europe: an experiment in diversity","title-short":"Contract archaeology in Europe","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00438240903371486","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"kuijpers2017","abstract":"This paper introduces the methodology of perceptive categories through which an empirical analysis of skill is achievable, taking European Bronze Age metalworking as a case study. Based on scientific data provided by the material sciences, in this case compositional and metallographic analyses of Late Copper Age and Early Bronze Age axes, the thresholds to categorise and interpret these data, and organise them in a chaîne opératoire, are centred on the human senses—and thus on metalworking as a craft. This is a pragmatic approach that appreciates scientific measurements of metal objects as essential empirical evidence whilst recognising that a considerable share of these archaeometric data are inapt or too detailed for an understanding of skill. This empirical approach towards skill is relevant to our knowledge of the role of crafts and materials in the past. After all, skill is a fundamental asset for the production of material culture, and a distinct human-material relationship characterised by an intimate form of material engagement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Kuijpers","given":"M.

  {"id":"kuldova2021","abstract":"Norwegian academia is increasingly subject to governance by numbers. A mixture of New Public Management, corporate governance and the power wielded by management-consultant firms underpins this ‘triumph of numbers’ intended to stimulate competition, productivity and excellence. Disillusionment, individualization, insecurity, anxiety and envy, have, however, become its products. Few believe that metrics are neutral, unbiased or objective. On the contrary, individual and institutional practices of gaming statistics and manipulating ratings and indicators are widespread, together known as micro-fraud. Predatory publishers, predatory journals and fake metrics markets are growing, considered a ‘global threat’ to science. Gaming in response to quantified control is symptomatic of the neoliberal moral economy of fraud and the criminogenic marketization of academia (Whyte and Wiegratz, 2016). While there may be ‘true believers’ in governance by numbers, this article focuses on what appears as the more common figure of the academic cynic, arguing that the triumph of numbers and the reproduction of governance by numbers despite mounting critique and critical awareness has to be understood through the notions of ideological fantasy, disavowal and pleasure and through a particular mode of subjectivation – namely, gamified subjectivity. Reflecting on (auto-)ethnographic observations and interviews with academics and trade unionists in Norwegian academia, this article offers a theoretical contribution to the function of cynical ideology and gamified subjectivity for organizational reproduction and its consequences for the possibility of resistance. Resistance, it is argued, would involve externalization of disbelief and degaming of the academic, and putting measure back into its proper place. Can politics proper emerge despite organizational cynicism?","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Kuldova","given":"Tereza Østbø"}],"citation-key":"kuldova2021","container-title":"Ephemera : Theory and Politics in Organization","ISSN":"2052-1499","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8]]},"language":"eng","license":"Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 Internasjonal","note":"Accepted: 2021-12-07T14:50:36Z","publisher":"Ephemera : Theory and Politics in Organization","source":"oda.oslomet.no","title":"The Cynical University: Gamified subjectivity in Norwegian academia","title-short":"The Cynical University","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://oda.oslomet.no/oda-xmlui/handle/11250/2833210"},

Conceptually and methodologically, I use these examples to accentuate lived experience as an essential part of research, especially in the seemingly dry bureaucratic settings. I do so in particular through engaging with the work of Michel de Certeau, whose ideas enjoy considerable traction in cultural geography but are seldom used in political geography and policy studies. An accent on the texture and feel of policy practice necessarily highlights the role of place in that practice.

The pace of obsidian studies in this regard has gathered significantly since around 2007, and we review the literature to gain a sense of where this momentum has come from, and what it heralds. In part, there is a data revolution underway, arising thanks to the capabilities for rapid survey and analysis enabled by field-portable analytical equipment. Obsidian studies are also gaining a stronger foothold in regions of the world where the approach was previously under-exploited. Our survey spans progress made in obsidian studies in the Mediterranean, Central Europe, the Near East, the Caucasus, Northeast Asia and Tibet, the Eurasian Arctic and Alaska, Southeast Asia, the Americas, Oceania, and Africa and Arabia. We also consider methodological issues related to compatibility of differing geochemical analytical techniques, and the state of the art in obsidian geochemical classification. The proliferation of new observations brings opportunities in terms of development of regional and global databases, as well as challenges of calibration and validation of analyses made by different scientists and laboratories employing diverse instrumentation.

  {"id":"labrador2012","abstract":"Archaeological database management systems serve the basic and important functions of ordering, archiving, and disseminating archaeological data. The increased availability of computers and data storage over the past two decades has enabled the exponential growth of archaeological databases and data models. Despite their importance and ubiquity, archaeological database systems are rarely the subject of theoretical analysis within the discipline due to their “black box” nature and the perceived objectivity of computerized systems. Inspired by H. Martin Wobst’s meditations on materiality and disciplinary ethics, in this paper I explore how archaeological database systems structure archaeological interpretation and disciplinary practice. In turn, I offer suggestions for how archaeological database systems can better support pressing anthropological research topics of the 21st century including multivocality, participatory research and ethics, social memory, and social complexity studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Labrador","given":"Angela M."}],"citation-key":"labrador2012","container-title":"Archaeologies","container-title-short":"Arch","DOI":"10.1007/s11759-012-9203-2","ISSN":"1935-3987","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"236-249","source":"Springer Link","title":"Ontologies of the Future and Interfaces for All: Archaeological Databases for the Twenty-First Century","title-short":"Ontologies of the Future and Interfaces for All","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11759-012-9203-2","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"laflamme2024","abstract":"Missing or inaccessible information about the methods used in scientific research slows the pace of discovery and hampers reproducibility. Yet little is known about how, why, and under what conditions researchers share detailed methods information, or about how such practices vary across social categories like career stage, field, and region. In this exploratory study, we surveyed 997 active researchers about their attitudes and behaviors with respect to methods sharing. The most common approach reported by respondents was private sharing upon request, but a substantial minority (33%) had publicly shared detailed methods information independently of their research findings. The most widely used channels for public sharing were connected to peer-reviewed publications, while the most significant barriers to public sharing were found to be lack of time and lack of awareness about how or where to share. Insofar as respondents were moderately satisfied with their ability to accomplish various goals associated with methods sharing, we conclude that efforts to increase public sharing may wish to focus on enhancing and building awareness of existing solutions—even as future research should seek to understand the needs of methods users and the extent to which they align with prevailing practices of sharing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"LaFlamme","given":"Marcel"},{"family":"Harney","given":"James"},{"family":"Hrynaszkiewicz","given":"Iain"}],"citation-key":"laflamme2024","container-title":"PeerJ","container-title-short":"PeerJ","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.16731","ISSN":"2167-8359","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,3]]},"language":"en","page":"e16731","publisher":"PeerJ Inc.","source":"peerj.com","title":"A survey of researchers’ methods sharing practices and priorities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://peerj.com/articles/16731","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"lai2019","abstract":"The programming language R is widely used in many fields. We explored the extent of reported R use in the field of ecology using the Web of Science and text mining. We analyzed the frequencies of R packages reported in more than 60,000 peer-reviewed articles published in 30 ecology journals during a 10-yr period ending in 2017. The number of studies reported using R as their primary tool in data analysis increased linearly from 11.4% in 2008 to 58.0% in 2017. The top 10 packages reported were lme4, vegan, nlme, ape, MuMIn, MASS, mgcv, ade4, multcomp, and car. The increasing popularity of R has most likely furthered open science in ecological research because it can improve reproducibility of analyses and captures workflows when scripts and codes are included and shared. These findings may not be entirely unique to R because there are other programming languages used by ecologists, but they do strongly suggest that given the relatively high frequency of reported use of R, it is a significant component of contemporary analytics in the field of ecology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Lai","given":"Jiangshan"},{"family":"Lortie","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Muenchen","given":"Robert A."},{"family":"Yang","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Keping"}],"citation-key":"lai2019","container-title":"Ecosphere","DOI":"10.1002/ecs2.2567","ISSN":"2150-8925","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2019 The Authors.","page":"e02567","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Evaluating the popularity of R in ecology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecs2.2567","volume":"10"},

It revises earlier accounts of archaeological simulation by proposing an alternation between programmatic phases, in which published work tends to be about simulation as a method, and mature phases in which there is greater emphasis on the substantive results of simulation experiments. The paper concludes that the burgeoning interest in computer simulation since circa 2000 is largely characterized by mature application in areas where it fits naturally into existing inferential frameworks (e.g., certain strands of evolutionary archaeology) but that explicitly “sociological” simulation remains a challenge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Lake","given":"M.

  {"id":"lariviere2020","abstract":"Contributorship statements were introduced by scholarly journals in the late 1990s to provide more details on the specific contributions made by authors to research papers. After more than a decade of idiosyncratic taxonomies by journals, a partnership between medical journals and standards organizations has led to the establishment, in 2015, of the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT), which provides a standardized set of 14 research contributions. Using the data from Public Library of Science (PLOS) journals over the 2017–2018 period (N = 30,054 papers), this paper analyzes how research contributions are divided across research teams, focusing on the association between division of labor and number of authors, and authors’ position and specific contributions. It also assesses whether some contributions are more likely to be performed in conjunction with others and examines how the new taxonomy provides greater insight into the gendered nature of labor division. The paper concludes with a discussion of results with respect to current issues in research evaluation, science policy, and responsible research practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Larivière","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Pontille","given":"David"},{"family":"Sugimoto","given":"Cassidy R."}],"citation-key":"lariviere2020","container-title":"Quantitative Science Studies","DOI":"10.1162/qss_a_00097","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,4]]},"page":"1-18","publisher":"MIT Press","source":"MIT Press Journals","title":"Investigating the division of scientific labor using the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00097"},
  {"id":"larkin2008","abstract":"Mainstream media and film theory are based on the ways that media technologies operate in Europe and the United States. In this groundbreaking work, Brian Larkin provides a history and ethnography of media in Nigeria, asking what media theory looks like when Nigeria rather than a European nation or the United States is taken as the starting point. Concentrating on the Muslim city of Kano in the north of Nigeria, Larkin charts how the material qualities of technologies and the cultural ambitions they represent feed into the everyday experiences of urban Nigeria. Media technologies were introduced to Nigeria by colonial regimes as part of an attempt to shape political subjects and create modern, urban Africans. Larkin considers the introduction of media along with electric plants and railroads as part of the wider infrastructural project of colonial and postcolonial urbanism. Focusing on radio networks, mobile cinema units, and the building of cinema theaters, he argues that what media come to be in Kano is the outcome of technology’s encounter with the social formations of northern Nigeria and with norms shaped by colonialism, postcolonial nationalism, and Islam. Larkin examines how media technologies produce the modes of leisure and cultural forms of urban Africa by analyzing the circulation of Hindi films to Muslim Nigeria, the leisure practices of Hausa cinemagoers in Kano, and the dynamic emergence of Nigerian video films. His analysis highlights the diverse, unexpected media forms and practices that thrive in urban Africa. Signal and Noise brings anthropology and media together in an original analysis of media’s place in urban life.","author":[{"family":"Larkin","given":"Brian"}],"citation-key":"larkin2008","ISBN":"978-0-8223-4108-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",3,31]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"332","publisher":"Duke University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Signal and Noise: Media, Infrastructure, and Urban Culture in Nigeria","title-short":"Signal and Noise","type":"book"},

It is a remarkable argument for understanding the reality of science in practical terms. In this book Latour, identified by Richard Rorty as the new \"bête noire of the science worshipers,\" gives us his most philosophically informed book since Science in Action. Through case studies of scientists in the Amazon analyzing soil and in Pasteur's lab studying the fermentation of lactic acid, he shows us the myriad steps by which events in the material world are transformed into items of scientific knowledge. Through many examples in the world of technology, we see how the material and human worlds come together and are reciprocally transformed in this process. Why, Latour asks, did the idea of an independent reality, free of human interaction, emerge in the first place? His answer to this question, harking back to the debates between Might and Right narrated by Plato, points to the real stakes in the so-called science wars: the perplexed submission of ordinary people before the warring forces of claimants to the ultimate truth.","author":[{"family":"Latour","given":"Bruno"}],"citation-key":"latour1999","ISBN":"978-0-674-65335-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"340","publisher":"Harvard University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Pandora's Hope: Essays on the Reality of Science Studies","title-short":"Pandora's Hope","type":"book"},

  {"id":"lau2018","abstract":"New digital publication technologies facilitate the publication of primary data and increase the ease with which archaeologists are able to share, combine, and synthesize large datasets. The research prospects that these technologies make possible are exciting, but they raise the issue of how comparable the original datasets really are. In this study we demonstrate an issue associated with many archaeological datasets: interanalyst variation. We conduct two independent analyses of one zooarchaeological assemblage and compare data. We consider the implications of the challenge interanalyst variation poses within projects and across projects. We then make recommendations for zooarchaeologists specifically, and for archaeologists more broadly, who are interested in publishing primary datasets in order to improve future understanding of these data and facilitate their reuse.

  {"id":"law1984","abstract":"It is argued that long-distance control depends upon the creation of a network of passive agents (both human and non-human) which makes it possible for emissaries to circulate from the centre to the periphery in a way that maintains their durability, forcefulness and fidelity. This argument is exemplified by the empirical case of the fifteenth and sixteenth century Portuguese expansion and the reconstruction of the navigational context undertaken by the Portuguese in order to secure the global mobility and durability of their vessels. It is also suggested that three classes of emissaries – documents, devices and drilled people – have, together and separately, been particularly important for long-distance control, and that the dominance of the West since the sixteenth century may be partly explained in terms of crucial innovations in the methods by which passive agents of these three types are produced and interrelated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Law","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"law1984","container-title":"The Sociological Review","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-954x.1984.tb00114.x","ISSN":"1467-954X","issued":{"date-parts":[["1984"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 1984 The Author","page":"234-263","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"On the methods of long-distance control: vessels, navigation and the Portuguese route to India","title-short":"On the methods of long-distance control","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-954X.1984.tb00114.x","volume":"32"},
  {"id":"law2004","abstract":"John Law argues that methods don't just describe social realities but are also involved in creating them. The implications of this argument are highly significant. If this is the case, methods are always political, and it raises the question of what kinds of social realities we want to create. Most current methods look for clarity and precision. It is usually said that only poor research produces messy findings, and the idea that things in the world might be fluid, elusive, or multiple is unthinkable. Law's startling argument is that this is wrong and it is time for a new approach. Many realities, he says, are vague and ephemeral. If methods want to know and help to shape the world, then they need to reinvent themselves and their politics to deal with mess. That is the challenge.

  {"id":"law2014","abstract":"After 15 years of hosting millions of user-built webpages, in April 2009 Yahoo! announced that they would be shutting down their United States Geocities webpages. Geocities was once the most common hosting service for low-cost personal webpages, including hundreds of public outreach sites about archaeology. Were the webpages moved to another hosting site, archived, or just abandoned? We tracked and recorded the fate of 88 of these webpages, eventually sending a survey to the webmasters asking them a range of questions. While we received relatively few responses, the answers to the questions were illuminating. Much of the current digital outreach performed all over the world relies on ‘free’ services such as Twitter, Flickr, Wordpress, Google Pages, or Facebook to host their content. What can the fate of archaeological content on Geocities pages tell us about the benefits and risks of using commercial infrastructure for archaeological outreach? We propose that sorting through the digital wreckage of past outreach efforts helps us to evaluate the eventual fate of the archaeological presence online.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Law","given":"Matt"},{"family":"Morgan","given":"Colleen"}],"citation-key":"law2014","container-title":"Present Pasts","DOI":"10.5334/pp.58","ISSN":"1759-2941","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",5,2]]},"language":"en","license":"Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:    Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a  Creative Commons Attribution License  that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.

The automated reconstruction of the argumentative structure of texts, Argument Mining, meets this challenge by not only showing what claims are being advanced (conclusion), but also why (premises). In this chapter, we start by surveying some of the foundations and state-of-the-art of argument mining and how they can be applied in domain-specific tasks in different research contexts, such as archaeology. After that, we discuss two central themes in argumentation critical for argument mining: argument schemes (common patterns of reasoning) and discourse markers (that function as argumentative indicators). Next, we describe how to create specific datasets for argument mining systems by means of annotated text corpora and how to store it using the Argument Interchange Format ontology. We conclude explaining Argument Analytics, a visual way to deliver the output of argument mining systems to its potential users.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Lawrence","given":"John"},{"family":"Pereira-Fariña","given":"Martín"},{"family":"Visser","given":"Jacky"}],"citation-key":"lawrence2023","collection-title":"Quantitative Archaeology and Archaeological Modelling","container-title":"Discourse and Argumentation in Archaeology: Conceptual and Computational Approaches","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-031-37156-1_12","editor":[{"family":"Gonzalez-Perez","given":"Cesar"},{"family":"Martin-Rodilla","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Pereira-Fariña","given":"Martín"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-031-37156-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"263-290","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"Argument Mining and Analytics in Archaeology","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-37156-1_12"},

  {"id":"lawson2021","abstract":"In the current literature on open government data (OGD) ecosystems, academics have paid little attention to the way data journalists realize the benefits of publicly-available data. To address this, in this study I use content analysis (n = 65), thematic analysis, and interviews with journalists (n = 5) to examine how the news media used data in their reporting during the NHS (National Health Service, UK) winter crisis of 2016–2017. The findings show that journalists to some extent realized the benefits of the OGD through the adoption of the population problem data-frame to criticize the government. But they were limited in their use of more informative and critical data-frames, even though they accessed the available data and had the relevant data skills. This was a product of the reification and naturalization of certain health data that rendered other data-informed news stories very hard to articulate. These findings suggest that data themselves – rather than just the motives of data producers – can limit the benefits that can be realized by data users.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Lawson","given":"BT"}],"citation-key":"lawson2021","container-title":"The Information Society","DOI":"10.1080/01972243.2021.1998274","ISSN":"0197-2243","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,6]]},"page":"1-11","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Realizing the benefits of open government data: Journalists’ coverage of the NHS winter crisis, 2016–17","title-short":"Realizing the benefits of open government data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01972243.2021.1998274","volume":"0"},

Targeted monotherapies produce high regression rates, albeit for limited patient subgroups, who inevitably succumb. We present a novel strategy for identifying customized combinations of triplets of targeted agents, utilizing a simplified interventional mapping system (SIMS) that merges knowledge about existent drugs and their impact on the hallmarks of cancer. Based on interrogation of matched lung tumor and normal tissue using targeted genomic sequencing, copy number variation, transcriptomics, and miRNA expression, the activation status of 24 interventional nodes was elucidated. An algorithm was developed to create a scoring system that enables ranking of the activated interventional nodes for each patient. Based on the trends of co-activation at interventional points, combinations of drug triplets were defined in order to overcome resistance. This methodology will inform a prospective trial to be conducted by the WIN consortium, aiming to significantly impact survival in metastatic NSCLC and other malignancies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Lazar","given":"Vladimir"},{"family":"Rubin","given":"Eitan"},{"family":"Depil","given":"Stephane"},{"family":"Pawitan","given":"Yudi"},{"family":"Martini","given":"Jean-François"},{"family":"Gomez-Navarro","given":"Jesus"},{"family":"Yver","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Kan","given":"Zhengyin"},{"family":"Dry","given":"Jonathan R."},{"family":"Kehren","given":"Jeanne"},{"family":"Validire","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Rodon","given":"Jordi"},{"family":"Vielh","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Ducreux","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Galbraith","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Lehnert","given":"Manfred"},{"family":"Onn","given":"Amir"},{"family":"Berger","given":"Raanan"},{"family":"Pierotti","given":"Marco A."},{"family":"Porgador","given":"Angel"},{"family":"Pramesh","given":"CS"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Ding-wei"},{"family":"Carvalho","given":"Andre L."},{"family":"Batist","given":"Gerald"},{"family":"Le Chevalier","given":"Thierry"},{"family":"Morice","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Besse","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Vassal","given":"Gilles"},{"family":"Mortlock","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Hansson","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Berindan-Neagoe","given":"Ioana"},{"family":"Dann","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Haspel","given":"Joel"},{"family":"Irimie","given":"Alexandru"},{"family":"Laderman","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Nechushtan","given":"Hovav"},{"family":"Al Omari","given":"Amal S."},{"family":"Haywood","given":"Trent"},{"family":"Bresson","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Soo","given":"Khee Chee"},{"family":"Osman","given":"Iman"},{"family":"Mata","given":"Hilario"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jack J."},{"family":"Jhaveri","given":"Komal"},{"family":"Meurice","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Palmer","given":"Gary"},{"family":"Lacroix","given":"Ludovic"},{"family":"Koscielny","given":"Serge"},{"family":"Eterovic","given":"Karina Agda"},{"family":"Blay","given":"Jean-Yves"},{"family":"Buller","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Eggermont","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Schilsky","given":"Richard L."},{"family":"Mendelsohn","given":"John"},{"family":"Soria","given":"Jean-Charles"},{"family":"Rothenberg","given":"Mace"},{"family":"Scoazec","given":"Jean-Yves"},{"family":"Ki Hong","given":"Waun"},{"family":"Kurzrock","given":"Razelle"}],"citation-key":"lazar2015","container-title":"Oncotarget","container-title-short":"Oncotarget","ISSN":"1949-2553","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",4,3]]},"page":"14139-14152","PMCID":"PMC4546456","PMID":"25944621","source":"PubMed Central","title":"A simplified interventional mapping system (SIMS) for the selection of combinations of targeted treatments in non-small cell lung cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4546456/","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"leckman2023","abstract":"Despite advocacy of landscape approaches in cultural resource management (CRM) and critiques of the site concept, CRM data collection methods in the western United States continue to focus on individual archaeological sites as units of observation, analysis, and management. The transect-recording unit (TRU) method strikes a balance between conventional site-based recording methods and site-less survey approaches by dividing survey space into a grid of uniformly sized cells for recording all cultural manifestations observed across a survey area. TRU survey generates site boundaries required by CRM regulations while retaining a fine-grained spatial framework for landscape-level research and management. This article discusses the technical requirements of the TRU system and its potential for improving landscape-level research and management. Advances in digital recording technologies and analysis techniques render the method efficient and effective in identifying cultural resource distributions and characteristics otherwise obscured by conventional approaches. The research and management potential of the TRU system is illustrated through identification and interpretation of precontact foot trails in New Mexico's Tularosa Basin. These trails are essentially invisible during pedestrian survey but are readily identifiable as linear patterns using aggregated landscape-scale TRU survey data from multiple survey projects, providing novel insight into precontact routes of movement and exchange.\n, \nA pesar de la defensa de los enfoques de paisaje en la Gestión de Recursos Culturales (en Inglés, CRM) y las críticas al concepto de sitio, los métodos de recopilación de datos de CRM en el oeste de los Estados Unidos continúan enfocándose en sitios arqueológicos individuales como unidades de observación, análisis y gestión. El método de unidad de registro de transectos (en Inglés, TRU) logra un equilibrio entre los métodos de registro convencionales basados en el sitio y los enfoques de estudio sin sitio al dividir el espacio del estudio en una cuadrícula de celdas de tamaño uniforme para registrar todas las manifestaciones culturales observadas en un área de estudio. La encuesta TRU genera los límites del sitio requeridos por las regulaciones de CRM mientras conserva un marco espacial detallado para la investigación y gestión a nivel de paisaje. Este artículo analiza los requisitos técnicos del sistema TRU y su potencial para mejorar la investigación y la gestión a nivel de paisaje. Los avances en las tecnologías de grabación digital y las técnicas de análisis hacen que el método sea eficiente y efectivo para identificar las distribuciones y características de los recursos culturales que de otro modo quedarían oscurecidas por los enfoques convencionales. El potencial de investigación y gestión del sistema TRU se ilustra a través de la identificación e interpretación de senderos peatonales previos al contacto en la cuenca Tularosa de Nuevo México. Estos senderos son esencialmente invisibles durante el estudio de peatones, pero se pueden identificar fácilmente como patrones lineales utilizando datos de estudio TRU agregados a escala de paisaje de múltiples proyectos de estudio, lo que brinda una visión novedosa de las rutas de movimiento e intercambio previas al contacto.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Leckman","given":"Phillip O."},{"family":"Heilen","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"leckman2023","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2022.36","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2]]},"language":"en","page":"11-28","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Our Checkered Past: Sites, Landscapes, Trails, and Transect-Recording Unit Survey","title-short":"Our Checkered Past","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/our-checkered-past/5CBAA4E7CDD4DBA5CFE00557E16B93C3","volume":"11"},

It begins with an outline of the main principles governing the distribution of stable light isotopes in foodwebs and the quality control issues specific to the calcified tissues used in these analyses, and then proceeds to describe the historical landmark studies that have marked major progress, either in their archaeological applications or in enhancing our understanding of the tools. They include the adoption of maize agriculture, marine-focused diets amongst coastal hunter–gatherers, trophic level amongst Glacial-period modern humans and Neanderthals, and the use of savannah resources by early hominins in Africa. Particular attention is given to the progress made in addressing the challenges that have arisen out of these studies, including issues related to the routing of dietary nutrients.

  {"id":"lee2009a","abstract":"This article marries the study of serious leisure pursuits with library and information science's (LIS) interest in people's everyday use, need, seeking, and sharing of information. Using a qualitative approach, the role of information as a phenomenon was examined in relation to the leisure activity of hobbyist collecting. In the process, a model and a typology for these collectors were developed. We find that the information needs and information seeking of hobbyist collectors is best represented as an interrelationship between information and object needs, information sources, and interactions between collectors and their publics. Our model of the role of information in a particular domain of hobbyist collecting moves away from the idea of one individual seeking information from formal systems and shifts towards a model that takes seriously the social milieu of a community. This collecting community represents a layer of a social system with complex interactions and specialized information needs that vary across collector types. Only the serious collectors habitually engage in information seeking and, occasionally, in information dissemination, in the traditional sense, yet information flows through the community and serves as a critical resource for sustaining individual and communal collecting activities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Charlotte P."},{"family":"Trace","given":"Ciaran B."}],"citation-key":"lee2009a","container-title":"Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology","DOI":"10.1002/asi.20996","ISSN":"1532-2890","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"en","page":"621-637","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The role of information in a community of hobbyist collectors","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.20996","volume":"60"},

He argued that a calling for science is critical for sustaining scientific work. Using Weber’s arguments for science as a vocation as a lens, in this paper, we discuss whether a calling for science may become difficult to maintain in increasingly bureaucratized scientific work—and also whether such a calling is necessary for the advance of science. We present empirical evidence for this bureaucratization of scientific work and further develop Weber’s discussion of science by contrasting it with the views of other theorists of science and innovation. Finally, we discuss the implications of these theories, develop a set of policy recommendations, and outline a research agenda designed to develop science policies and a sociology of science that match this shift from vocation to bureaucracy in scientific work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"You-Na"},{"family":"Walsh","given":"John P."}],"citation-key":"lee2022","container-title":"Science, Technology, & Human Values","container-title-short":"Science, Technology, & Human Values","DOI":"10.1177/01622439211026020","ISSN":"0162-2439, 1552-8251","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9]]},"language":"en","page":"1057-1085","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Rethinking Science as a Vocation: One Hundred Years of Bureaucratization of Academic Science","title-short":"Rethinking Science as a Vocation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01622439211026020","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"leighton2015","abstract":"Abstract\n            Archaeologists’ excavation practices vary significantly from country to country and site to site. But variation in the most fundamental, ‘common-sense’ excavation practices is ‘black-boxed’ - it is not discussed outside casual, informal contexts, and is treated as having no effect on higher-level interpretation. These practices can, however, be a source of conflict when archaeologists from different communities of practice work together. In this paper, I explore what variation in excavation methodology reveals about the nature of archaeological knowledge itself. By comparing methodologies and the organization of labour on British and Andean excavations, I argue that archaeologists in different communities of practice have divergent understandings of what the object of archaeological investigation is, and of how it can be known, and by whom. This results in contrasting understandings of the nature of material/archaeological objects, as well as contrasting conceptualizations of excavation as an ‘expert’ practice – one requiring skills, knowledge and bodily practices that are specific to trained archaeologists. Situating these concerns in historical and ethnographic context, this paper suggests that archaeological excavation is, in fact, a far more complex, nuanced and variable practice than the lack of attention paid to it implies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Leighton","given":"Mary"}],"citation-key":"leighton2015","container-title":"Archaeological Dialogues","container-title-short":"Arch.

After arguing that Suppes’ characterization of data models falls short in this respect, I discuss a case of data processing within exploratory research in plant phenotyping and use it to highlight the difference between practices aimed to make data usable as evidence and practices aimed to use data to represent a specific phenomenon. I then argue that whether a set of objects functions as data or models does not depend on intrinsic differences in their physical properties, level of abstraction or the degree of human intervention involved in generating them, but rather on their distinctive roles towards identifying and characterizing the targets of investigation. The paper thus proposes a characterization of data models that builds on Suppes’ attention to data practices, without however needing to posit a fixed hierarchy of data and models or a highly exclusionary definition of data models as statistical constructs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Leonelli","given":"Sabina"}],"citation-key":"leonelli2019","container-title":"European Journal for Philosophy of Science","container-title-short":"Euro Jnl Phil Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s13194-018-0246-0","ISSN":"1879-4920","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,15]]},"language":"english","page":"22","title":"What distinguishes data from models?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13194-018-0246-0","volume":"9"},

Work at the UNESCO World Heritage site of Çatalhöyük has demonstrated that new digital approaches for capturing, processing, analyzing, and curating stratigraphic data in 3D are now feasible. Real-time visualization engines allow us to simulate the stratigraphy of a site, the three-dimensional surfaces of ancient buildings, as well as the ever-changing morphology of cultural landscapes. Nonetheless, more work needs to be done to address methodological questions such as follows: can three-dimensional models and stratigraphic relationships, based on 3D surfaces and volumes, be used to perform archaeological interpretation? How can a 3D virtual scenario become the interface to cultural data and metadata stored in external online databases? How can we foster a sense of presence and user embodiment in the simulation of ancient cities and archaeological sites? This article aims to provide viable solutions to the methodological challenge of designing a comprehensive digital archaeological workflow from the data acquisition and interpretation in the field to a three-dimensional digital data curation based on interactive visualization, searchable 3D data, and virtual environments.

  {"id":"levin2016","abstract":"This article documents how biomedical researchers in the United Kingdom understand and enact the idea of “openness.” This is of particular interest to researchers and science policy worldwide in view of the recent adoption of pioneering policies on Open Science and Open Access by the U.K. government—policies whose impact on and implications for research practice are in need of urgent evaluation, so as to decide on their eventual implementation elsewhere. This study is based on 22 in-depth interviews with U.K. researchers in systems biology, synthetic biology, and bioinformatics, which were conducted between September 2013 and February 2014. Through an analysis of the interview transcripts, we identify seven core themes that characterize researchers’ understanding of openness in science and nine factors that shape the practice of openness in research. Our findings highlight the implications that Open Science policies can have for research processes and outcomes and provide recommendations for enhancing their content, effectiveness, and implementation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Levin","given":"Nadine"},{"family":"Leonelli","given":"Sabina"},{"family":"Weckowska","given":"Dagmara"},{"family":"Castle","given":"David"},{"family":"Dupré","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"levin2016","container-title":"Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society","container-title-short":"Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society","DOI":"10.1177/0270467616668760","ISSN":"0270-4676","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"128-141","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"How Do Scientists Define Openness?

  {"id":"levin2017","abstract":"Open Science policies encourage researchers to disclose a wide range of outputs from their work, thus codifying openness as a specific set of research practices and guidelines that can be interpreted and applied consistently across disciplines and geographical settings. In this paper, we argue that this “one-size-fits-all” view of openness sidesteps key questions about the forms, implications, and goals of openness for research practice. We propose instead to interpret openness as a dynamic and highly situated mode of valuing the research process and its outputs, which encompasses economic as well as scientific, cultural, political, ethical, and social considerations. This interpretation creates a critical space for moving beyond the economic definitions of value embedded in the contemporary biosciences landscape and Open Science policies, and examining the diversity of interests and commitments that affect research practices in the life sciences. To illustrate these claims, we use three case studies that highlight the challenges surrounding decisions about how––and how best––to make things open. These cases, drawn from ethnographic engagement with Open Science debates and semistructured interviews carried out with UK-based biologists and bioinformaticians between 2013 and 2014, show how the enactment of openness reveals judgments about what constitutes a legitimate intellectual contribution, for whom, and with what implications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Levin","given":"Nadine"},{"family":"Leonelli","given":"Sabina"}],"citation-key":"levin2017","container-title":"Science, Technology, & Human Values","container-title-short":"Science, Technology, & Human Values","DOI":"10.1177/0162243916672071","ISSN":"0162-2439, 1552-8251","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",3]]},"language":"en","page":"280-305","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"How Does One “Open” Science?

This elegant and evocative look at the move toward objectivity first pioneered by Descartes sheds new light on some old and still perplexing problems in modern science.\" Bernard Lightman, York University, Canada  In Dying to Know, eminent critic George Levine makes a landmark contribution to the history and theory of scientific knowledge. This long-awaited book explores the paradoxes of our modern ideal of objectivity, in particular its emphasis on the impersonality and disinterestedness of truth. How, asks Levine, did this idea of selfless knowledge come to be established and moralized in the nineteenth century?  Levine shows that for nineteenth-century scientists, novelists, poets, and philosophers, access to the truth depended on conditions of such profound self-abnegation that pursuit of it might be taken as tantamount to the pursuit of death. The Victorians, he argues, were dying to know in the sense that they could imagine achieving pure knowledge only in a condition where the body ceases to make its claims: to achieve enlightenment, virtue, and salvation, one must die.  Dying to Know is ultimately a study of this moral ideal of epistemology. But it is also something much more: a spirited defense of the difficult pursuit of objectivity, the ethical significance of sacrifice, and the importance of finding a shareable form of knowledge.","author":[{"family":"Levine","given":"George"}],"citation-key":"levine2002","ISBN":"978-0-226-47536-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",9,15]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"344","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Dying to Know: Scientific Epistemology and Narrative in Victorian England","title-short":"Dying to Know","type":"book"},

  {"id":"li2012","abstract":"Human diseases can be caused by complex mechanisms involving aberrations in numerous proteins and pathways. With recent advances in genomics, elucidating the molecular basis of disease on a personalized level has become an attainable goal. In many cases, relevant molecular targets will be identified for which approved drugs already exist, and the potential repositioning of these drugs to a new indication can be investigated. Repositioning is an accelerated route for drug discovery because existing drugs have established clinical and pharmacokinetic data. Personalized medicine and repositioning both aim to improve the productivity of current drug discovery pipelines, which expend enormous time and cost to develop new drugs, only to have them fail in clinical trials because of lack of efficacy or toxicity. Here, we discuss the current state of research in these two fields, focusing on recent large-scale efforts to systematically find repositioning candidates and elucidate individual disease mechanisms in cancer. We also discuss scenarios in which personalized drug repositioning could be particularly rewarding, such as for diseases that are rare or have specific mutations, as well as current challenges in this field. With an increasing number of drugs being approved for rare cancer subtypes, personalized medicine and repositioning approaches are poised to significantly alter the way we diagnose diseases, infer treatments and develop new drugs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Yvonne Y."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Steven JM"}],"citation-key":"li2012","container-title":"Genome Medicine","container-title-short":"Genome Medicine","DOI":"10.1186/gm326","ISSN":"1756-994X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,30]]},"page":"27","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Drug repositioning for personalized medicine","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/gm326","volume":"4"},

These results provide new perspectives on an archaeological problem related to the hitherto assumed importance of the site of Myrtos, on the southeastern coast of Crete, in the production and trade of such pottery.

This data, derived from a finite amount of material, holds immense value in the analysis of our human ancestors' lives. To ensure the long-term reusability of this data, one potential approach is to make it FAIR. This entails making the data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. A Needs Analysis revealed that the reuse of bioarchaeological data is considered significant, with extensive reuse already taking place across various bioarchaeology subdisciplines. However, currently, there is no standardized process for data creation and deposition. Consequently, this wealth of information is processed in different ways, at varying levels, resulting in a range of data types that are deposited in diverse locations, with different levels of Open Access and copyright, even within a specialization. Furthermore, there is a mixed adoption of elements that can facilitate FAIRness, such as Persistent Identifiers (including ORCiDs), appropriate metadata, and systematic documentation. To further enhance opportunities for data preservation and reuse, as well as to maximize the benefits derived from the expanding pool of bioarchaeology data, a standardized data management procedure encompassing all aspects of bioarchaeology, along with a federated search interface, is essential.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Lien-Talks","given":"Alphaeus"}],"citation-key":"lien-talks2024","DOI":"10.5281/zenodo.10819068","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,14]]},"language":"eng","source":"Zenodo","title":"How FAIR is Bioarchaeological Data: with a particular emphasis on making archaeological science data Reusable","title-short":"How FAIR is Bioarchaeological Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://zenodo.org/records/10819068"},

  {"id":"linde2018","abstract":"This article introduces a special volume of Advances in Archaeological Practice dedicated to the interpretation and presentation of archaeology. It provides an overview of several essays that came out of a session at the European Association of Archaeology Conference in 2017, which focused upon how interpretation can be implemented within daily practices of (cultural resource management) archaeology in a way that provides heritage value. We bring the arguments together into a call for a creative, interpretive archaeology that does not take compliance or academic publications as its end goal but will speak to a far wider range of audiences through the development and presentation of stories and narratives that truly engage and inspire people. We argue that this can be achieved by implementing “emotion design” methods that dynamically differentiate between information, message, emotion, and media, by working closely together with creatives, interpretive experts, communities, and partners and, ultimately, by integrating interpretation firmly at the core of planning processes, archaeological workflows, and our daily practices., Este artículo sirve de introducción a un volumen especial de Advances in Archaeological Practice dedicado a la interpretación y presentación de la arqueología.

  {"id":"lischer-katz2017","abstract":"The primary purpose of this research is to gain understanding into the processes of knowledge construction and the underlying epistemic practices and assumptions of media preservationists working in the artisanal mode of preservation to produce digital manifestations of complex visual documents, specifically analog video recordings. It focuses on “artisanal digital reformatting” in institutional sites of small-scale, high-skilled digital copying.    This dissertation research studied 13 media preservationists (eight digitizers, four administrators, one quality control specialist) recruited from six preservation labs. Data were generated in the form of discourses and observations of material practices by conducting semi-structured interviews, video-recorded observations, and review sessions in which participants reflected on the video-recordings of their workplace practices. Data were analyzed using qualitative-interpretive methods, including discourse analysis and interpretive phenomenological analysis.    The findings of this research suggest that artisanal digital reformatting is an interpretive act of visual translation that unfolds within epistemological, phenomenological and cultural dimensions of participants’ workplace practices. This work blends “mental and manual” dimensions of technical labor in which participants incorporate their trained vision, embodied judgment and historical knowledge to detect and diagnose typified visual errors to produce “legitimate” digital copies. Participants identify tensions between trust, credibility and the applicability of new practical knowledge as it circulates across three zones of knowledge construction in the context of their situated activities: personal, institutional and community zones of knowledge. Analysis of digitizers’ moral commitments to archival imperatives and their efforts to enact them in practice suggests that normative considerations operate alongside the practical requirements of digital copying.   Through an analysis of participants’ practices and discourses, a coordinated array of epistemic techniques and visual practices were identified. This research analyzed the experiences of digitizers carrying out their work to understand how they train their perceptions as well as the affective dimensions of their work. This research then considered how participants integrate knowledge from the wider occupational community of media preservationists into digitization work. Finally, this research explored how normative aspects of practice shape the construction of knowledge, by analyzing participants’ moral commitments to archival imperatives and their efforts to enact those commitments in practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Lischer-Katz","given":"Zachariah S."}],"citation-key":"lischer-katz2017","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"publisher":"No Publisher Supplied","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"The construction of preservation knowledge in the artisanal digital reformatting of analog video recordings","type":"thesis","URL":"https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/55562/"},

  {"id":"llobera2011","abstract":"This paper reviews and evaluates the potential use of modern visualization techniques in archaeology. It suggests the need to apply and develop such techniques as a central part of any modern archaeological investigation. The use of these methods is associated with wider questions about data representations, in particular, their integration with archaeological theory and their role in facilitating analysis and shaping interpretation. Concern for these questions and with the overall potential that information systems provide to capture, represent, analyze, and model archaeological information suggests the need for a new interdisciplinary focus, Archaeological Information Science. For such a focus to prosper, archaeologists need to develop additional skills that go beyond mere technical ones. They need to become more active in the design and creation of future information archaeological systems. To this end, archaeologists are urged to view this task as a way to extend archaeology in new directions and to recognize that the digital representation and treatment of archaeological information can generate new forms of doing archaeology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Llobera","given":"Marcos"}],"citation-key":"llobera2011","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-010-9098-4","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"193-223","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Archaeological Visualization: Towards an Archaeological Information Science (AISc)","title-short":"Archaeological Visualization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-010-9098-4","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"lock2017","abstract":"Being human embodies understandings of space and spatial relationships which are embedded within the material world and are underpinned by complex frameworks of knowledge and experience. Just as this applied to people living in the past, so it applies to those of us concerned with trying to understand those past lives through the archaeological record. Most, if not all, archaeological material has a spatial component and it is not surprising, therefore, that spatial thinking has been central within archaeological endeavour since the beginnings of the discipline. Specific forms of spatial thinking have changed with developing theory and methods and with changing analytical and technological opportunities resulting in the rich variety of approaches available to us today. Within this development, the rapid adoption of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology since the early 1990s has had a major impact on archaeology and related disciplines and its use is now almost taken for granted. Although the use of GIS in archaeology has always been, and still is contentious at the theoretical level, the attractions of the technology are usually seen to outweigh any restrictions or disadvantages. In this paper we situate the use of GIS, including the papers in this volume, within the wider arena of spatial thinking in archaeology in an attempt to assess the impact that this technology has had on how we think spatially.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Lock","given":"Gary"},{"family":"Pouncett","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"lock2017","collection-title":"Archaeological GIS Today: Persistent Challenges, Pushing Old Boundaries, and Exploring New Horizons","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2017.06.002","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,1]]},"page":"129-135","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Spatial thinking in archaeology: Is GIS the answer?","title-short":"Spatial thinking in archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440317300845","volume":"84"},

  {"id":"loignon2009","abstract":"Nrf2 is the key transcription factor for cytoprotective gene programs. Nrf2 is normally maintained at very low concentrations by proteasomal degradation, through its interaction with the adapter protein Keap1 and the Cul3 E3 ligase. Increased Nrf2 concentration resulting from loss of function Keap1 mutations has been described in chemoresistant non–small cell lung cancer. Previous studies in breast cancer showed low levels of some Nrf2-regulated detoxification genes, but the mechanism has not been systematically examined. We found that half of the breast cancer cell lines examined have decreased concentration of Nrf2 compared with normal mammary epithelial cell lines, associated with variable but detectable levels in Keap1 levels, and consistently increased Cul3 mRNA and protein. Immunochemistry showed that 7 of 10 breast cancer specimens examined also have low Nrf2 levels and increased Cul3. Keap1 protein levels are variable. We found no C23Y mutation in Keap1 of any of the cell lines. Using siRNA, we silenced Cul3 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and microarray analysis reveals the induction of GCL, NQO1, AKR1C1, UGDH, and TXN by at least 2-fold. The Nrf2-regulated ABCC1 drug transporter was also found to be increased. These Cul3-silenced MCF7 cells are highly resistant to oxidative stress induced by H2O2, to the carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene, and to both Doxorubicin and Paclitaxel. This high Cul3/low Nrf2 signature may be key to cellular sensitivity to both chemical carcinogeneic stimuli as well as to cytotoxicity of commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs in established breast cancers.

Artworks are also connected with eterogeneous documentary heritage that enlighted the need of creating new narratives avoiding the descriptive and analytical ones. The project offers a workflow that using different vocabularies (database and open data) is able to structure data and use visual media (3d web publishing) to create different degree of accessibility to cultural heritage content. The recently launched SMART MUSEUM research, works on automated procedures to show, through graphics, the complex phenomena triggered by the attractive weight of the collections. In this case, the artwork assumes artistic, social and media values that contribute to create novel attributes able to identify an attractive weight of the artwork. These value affects the attractiveness of an artwork within the exhibition project and can be an interesting subject for a correct foreshadowing of visitor flows. The involved elements are the exhibition area (the graphic field), the collection (the attractive elements) and the users. The conceived procedure, once automated, becomes a prototype to support the curators to control and improve the efficiency of the exhibition layout.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Lo Turco","given":"Massimiliano"},{"family":"Giovannini","given":"Elisabetta Caterina"}],"citation-key":"loturco2020","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2020.102639","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"102639","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Towards a phygital heritage approach for museum collection","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X20304302","volume":"34"},

Ultimately, Lucas calls for a rethinking of the nature of the archaeological record and the kind of history and narratives written from it.","author":[{"family":"Lucas","given":"Gavin"}],"citation-key":"lucas2012","ISBN":"978-0-521-27969-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,6]]},"language":"english","number-of-pages":"322","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Understanding the Archaeological Record","type":"book"},

  {"id":"lucas2015","abstract":"AbstractThis paper discusses the concept of contemporaneity as it is used in archaeology. In particular, two general usages are examined. The first concerns the idea of contemporaneity in the context of archaeological dating and chronology, the second relates to the characterization of the archaeological record as a contemporary phenomenon. In both cases, related concepts are explored, namely synchronism and anachronism respectively. The paper offers a critique of these conventional usages of the idea of contemporaneity and argues for an alternative, linking this with the concept of consociation, a term coined by the phenomenologist Alfred Schutz in the early 20th century.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Lucas","given":"Gavin"}],"citation-key":"lucas2015","container-title":"Archaeological Dialogues","DOI":"10.1017/S1380203815000021","ISSN":"1380-2038, 1478-2294","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6]]},"page":"1-15","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Archaeology and contemporaneity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/archaeological-dialogues/article/archaeology-and-contemporaneity/37248D1F4365DF055A16D5E8327F668D","volume":"22"},
  {"id":"lucas2019","abstract":"\"How do archaeologists make knowledge? Debates in the latter half of the twentieth century revolved around broad, abstract philosophies and theories such as positivism and hermeneutics which have all but vanished today. By contrast, in recent years there has been a great deal of attention given to more concrete, practice-based studies, especially focusing on the coalface of archaeology, i.e. fieldwork. But where one was too abstract, the other has become too descriptive and commonly evades issues of epistemic judgement. This book remains within a practice-based approach but also tries to re-introduce a normative dimension to knowledge practices in archaeology - especially in relation to archaeological practice further down the 'assembly line': the production of published texts. For it is here that archaeological knowledge arguably becomes most stabilised and widely disseminated. By exploring the composition of texts in archaeology and the relation between their structural, performative characteristics and key epistemic virtues, this book aims to move debate in both knowledge and writing practices in a new direction. Although directed mainly at archaeologists, the argument offered in this book necessarily has relevance for all academic disciplines concerned with how knowledge production and textual composition intertwine\"–","author":[{"family":"Lucas","given":"Gavin"}],"citation-key":"lucas2019","event-place":"Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY","ISBN":"978-0-429-81521-8 978-0-429-44448-7 978-0-429-81522-5 978-0-429-81520-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY","title":"Writing the past: Knowledge and literary production in archaeology","title-short":"Writing the past","type":"book"},

  {"id":"luglie2018","abstract":"The emergence of Neolithic in Sardinia and Corsica has more and more the aspect of a sharp rupture that led to the first permanent occupation of the islands through a process of diffuse and rapid territorialization. To date, any evidence of contiguity is still lacking between first Neolithic implantations and last Mesolithic frequentations that stretch sporadically over more than two millennia, until the 8.2 kyear cold climatic event. Besides, Mesolithic-Neolithic discontinuity is proved not only archaeologically, on the grounds of stratigraphy, settlement strategies, and technological systems. Indeed, new mitochondrial DNA genome sequences from Mesolithic Sardinia provide evidence of a substantial diversity between the two populations. The earliest stages (scouting phase) of Neolithic colonization of the islands are scarcely documented thus far, even if some clues would place them consistently in the flow of the Neolithic expansion towards the western Mediterranean. Around the central centuries of the 6th millennium cal BC, the following step (consolidation phase) corresponds to the formation and spread of the Cardial impressed ware facies along the coastal belt of the central and north Tyrrhenian shore. Since then, both Sardinia-Corsica and the Tyrrhenian strands opposite to this region reveal an almost symmetrical and synchronous rhythm of evolution. In the last centuries of the 6th millennium cal BC, new influences coming from the North of the Italian mainland, possibly through the mediation of the Tyrrhenian Linear Carved ware facies, acted as a push factor towards the recombination of the shared traditional traits into new original cultures. In the two islands, at the end of this trajectory, the process of neolithization was almost accomplished and the evolution of Neolithic cultures, although interlinked, went on separately afterwards.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Lugliè","given":"Carlo"}],"citation-key":"luglie2018","container-title":"Quaternary International","container-title-short":"Quaternary International","DOI":"10.1016/j.quaint.2017.12.032","ISSN":"1040-6182","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,6]]},"source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Your path led trough the sea … The emergence of Neolithic in Sardinia and Corsica","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618217305426"},
  {"id":"lukas2018","abstract":"Çatalhöyük was first discovered as one of the earliest urban settlements in the late 1950s and excavated by James Mellaart between 1961 and 1965. The 9000-year-old town in central Turkey rapidly became famous internationally due to the large size and dense occupation of the settlement, as well as the spectacular wall paintings and other art that were uncovered inside the houses. Since 1993, under the direction of Ian Hodder, research at Çatalhöyük has pioneered a reflexive approach to archaeological practice, in which information is permanently open to reinterpretation by both scholars and the public. This approach acknowledges the mutual dependence of knowledge and the underlying research, to which end the Çatalhöyük Project decided to make its records available via the Web and to invite public comment since its onset. After 25 years of excavation, the project’s digital assets now amount to close to 5TB, including formal textual and numeric records, freetext documents, audiovisual materials, and a comprehensive collection of spatial data. The reflexive method, or ‘documentation of the documentation process,’ adds a separate layer of information that specifies how data have been gathered, and facilitates critique, understanding, and the evolution of knowledge.In this paper we lay out our vision of an interactive archive that provides access to the multi layered information contained in this massive amount of data and how web technological advances have been incorporated into the digital data management at Çatalhöyük. Ultimately, the goal is to support an interdisciplinary process of assembling data into arguments on the basis of multiple lines of evidence. The ‘Living Archive’ will enable intuitive engagement across the entire variety of research, making use of the rich reflexive information stored with the data. The results of new analyses can in turn be reintegrated with the already existing data. The application will use open standards so that the knowledge gathered at Çatalhöyük can be linked with other projects that follow similar publication procedures based on the semantic web approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Lukas","given":"Dominik"},{"family":"Engel","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Mazzucato","given":"Camilla"}],"citation-key":"lukas2018","container-title":"Journal of Field Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00934690.2018.1516110","ISSN":"0093-4690","issue":"sup1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,31]]},"page":"S19-S30","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Towards a Living Archive: Making Multi Layered Research Data and Knowledge Generation Transparent","title-short":"Towards a Living Archive","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00934690.2018.1516110","volume":"43"},

Mirroring changes in archaeology in general, the use of graphs (bar graphs, line graphs, scatterplots, etc.) to summarize analytical findings in zooarchaeology began in earnest in the 1960s. The variety of graph types expanded in the 1970s as the diversity of zooarchaeological variables documented increased in an effort to answer new questions regarding human behavioral interactions with prey animals and, in the 1980s, to address taphonomic concerns. Newly available computer technology and increased knowledge of statistics, along with the general belief that numbers are objective measures of magnitude, facilitated this expansion. The mean number of graphs per page in zooarchaeology textbooks has remained static (statistically) over the past five decades. The mean number of graphs per page in taphonomy books is a bit greater than in the zooarchaeology texts but statistically no different. The paucity of detailed discussions of what makes for a good graph in the zooarchaeology literature parallels that in the archaeology literature in general. Each graph has its own more or less unique grammar, so rules of thumb for producing effective (minimum mental gymnastics required) and efficient (minimal ink used) graphs are outlined.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Lyman","given":"R.

  {"id":"madgwick2021","abstract":"The expansion of isotope analyses has transformed the study of past migration and mobility, sometimes providing unexpected and intriguing results. This has, in turn, led to media attention (and concomitant misrepresentation) and scepticism from some archaeologists. Such scepticism is healthy and not always without foundation. Isotope analysis is yet to reach full maturity and challenging issues remain, concerning diagenesis, biosphere mapping resolution and knowledge of the drivers of variation. Bold and over-simplistic interpretations have been presented, especially when relying on single isotope proxies, and researchers have at times been accused of following specific agendas. It is therefore vital to integrate archaeological and environmental evidence to support interpretation. Most importantly, the use of multiple isotope proxies is key: isotope analysis is an exclusive approach and therefore single analyses provide only limited resolution. The growth in isotope research has led to a growth in rebuttals and counter-narratives. Such rebuttals warrant the same critical appraisal that is applied to original research, both of evidence for their assertions and the potential for underlying agendas. This paper takes a case study-based approach focusing on pig movements to Neolithic henge complexes to explore the dangers encountered in secondary use of isotope data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Madgwick","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Lamb","given":"Angela"},{"family":"Sloane","given":"Hilary"},{"family":"Nederbragt","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Albarella","given":"Umberto"},{"family":"Parker Pearson","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Evans","given":"Jane"}],"citation-key":"madgwick2021","container-title":"Archaeological Journal","DOI":"10.1080/00665983.2021.1911099","ISSN":"0066-5983","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,3]]},"page":"361-385","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"A veritable confusion: use and abuse of isotope analysis in archaeology","title-short":"A veritable confusion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00665983.2021.1911099","volume":"178"},

  {"id":"maeda2018","abstract":", \nThe excavation of several structures at the site of Hasankeyf Höyük in south-east Anatolia has revealed evidence for the continuity of hunter-gatherer lithic technology into the early stages of the Neolithic in the tenth to ninth millennia BC. In particular, the Nemrik point, previously seen as a hallmark of the early Neolithic, can now be shown to have been in use in a local tradition of hunter-gatherer lithic technology. Overall, the continuity in time and space at Hasankeyf Höyük indicates a long-term persistence of lithic technologies, which contrasts with the pattern of change in the Levant and which suggests different pathways to the Neolithic in different parts of the Fertile Crescent region in the Near East.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Maeda","given":"Osamu"}],"citation-key":"maeda2018","container-title":"Antiquity","DOI":"10.15184/aqy.2017.219","ISSN":"0003-598X, 1745-1744","issue":"361","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2]]},"language":"en","page":"56-73","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Lithic analysis and the transition to the Neolithic in the Upper Tigris Valley: recent excavations at Hasankeyf Höyük","title-short":"Lithic analysis and the transition to the Neolithic in the Upper Tigris Valley","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/lithic-analysis-and-the-transition-to-the-neolithic-in-the-upper-tigris-valley-recent-excavations-at-hasankeyf-hoyuk/B8416A9A0CC8457C6EDC2493952DDBCF","volume":"92"},
  {"id":"maemura2018","abstract":"The increasing use and prominence of web archives raises the urgency of establishing mechanisms for transparency in the making of web archives to facilitate the process of evaluating a web archive's provenance, scoping, and absences. Some choices and process events are captured automatically, but their interactions are not currently well understood or documented. This study examined the decision space of web archives and its role in shaping what is and what is not captured in the web archiving process. By comparing how three different web archives collections were created and documented, we investigate how curatorial decisions interact with technical and external factors and we compare commonalities and differences. The findings reveal the need to understand both the social and technical context that shapes those decisions and the ways in which these individual decisions interact. Based on the study, we propose a framework for documenting key dimensions of a collection that addresses the situated nature of the organizational context, technical specificities, and unique characteristics of web materials that are the focus of a collection. The framework enables future researchers to undertake empirical work studying the process of creating web archives collections in different contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Maemura","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Worby","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Milligan","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Becker","given":"Christoph"}],"citation-key":"maemura2018","container-title":"Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology","DOI":"10.1002/asi.24048","ISSN":"2330-1643","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,1]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2018 ASIS&T","page":"1223-1233","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"If these crawls could talk: Studying and documenting web archives provenance","title-short":"If these crawls could talk","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.24048","volume":"69"},
  {"id":"maemura2023","abstract":"Web archives collections have become important sources for Internet scholars by documenting the past versions of web resources. Understanding how these collections are created and curated is of increasing concern and recent web archives scholarship has studied how the artefacts stored in archives represent specific curatorial choices and collecting practices. This paper takes a novel approach in studying web archiving practice, by focusing on the challenges encountered in archival web crawling and what they reveal about the web itself. Inspired by foundational work in infrastructure studies, infrastructural inversion is applied to study how crawler interactions surface otherwise invisible, background or taken-for-granted aspects of the web. This framework is applied to study three examples selected from interviews and ethnographic fieldwork observations of web archiving practices at the Danish Royal Library, with findings demonstrating how the challenges of archival crawling illuminate the web’s varied actors, as well as their changing relationships, power differentials and politics. Ultimately, analysis through infrastructural inversion reveals how collection via crawling positions archives as active participants in web infrastructure, both shaping and shaped by the needs and motivations of other web actors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Maemura","given":"Emily"}],"citation-key":"maemura2023","container-title":"Internet Histories","DOI":"10.1080/24701475.2023.2258697","ISSN":"2470-1475","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"page":"1-16","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Sorting URLs out: seeing the web through infrastructural inversion of archival crawling","title-short":"Sorting URLs out","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/24701475.2023.2258697","volume":"0"},
  {"id":"magnani2014","abstract":"Although alternatives have become available, pen and ink drawings of stone tools dominate archaeological publications. Despite the existence of a conventional illustration framework, the work produced by illustrators can be inconsistent and hinges on skill level and time commitment. Discussions going back to the 1880s critically question the use of illustrations for the purpose of scientific publication. Alternatives, such as laser scanning and photogrammetric modeling, are now available for displaying lithics. These alternatives can remove the subjectivity involved in artistic rendering, creating replicable results, regardless of who is collecting the data. In addition to creating more regularized and objective representations, there are a significant number of analytical and other benefits to adopting novel imaging techniques to depict stone tools in publications. A set of three-dimensional (3D) models are presented here to demonstrate the capabilities of laser scanning and, potentially, photogrammetric modeling as replacements for lithic illustration.\n, \nA pesar de que existen alternativas más objetivas, los dibujos en papel y tinta de objetos líticos predominan en publicaciones académicas. Aunque existen convenciones de ilustración, el trabajo de los ilustradores puede ser variable y depende de la habilidad y el tiempo empleado. Los problemas acerca la ilustración científica no son nuevos, ya que discusiones desde 1880 cuestionan críticamente la objetividad de las ilustraciones para publicaciones científicas. Algunas alternativas como el escáner láser y la fotogrametría están ahora ampliamente disponibles para las ilustraciones de lítica. Estas alternativas eliminan la subjetividad que implica un diseño artístico, generando resultados que son replicables más allá de quien haya producido los datos. Además de crear representaciones más objetivas, hay un número amplio de ventajas analíticas al adoptar nuevas técnicas de ilustración de lítica. Los investigadores pueden potencialmente realizar nuevos análisis digitales en 3D, ahorrar en su investigación, además de facilitar el acceso a colecciones excavadas globalmente. El artículo presenta una serie de modelos 3D que demuestran la potencialidad del escaneado láser y de la fotogrametría como reemplazos del dibujo lítico. Los modelos de escaneado láser son un sustituto ideal para las ilustraciones, mientras que los modelos fotogramétricos son en muchos casos inadecuados, pero presentan otras ventajas que han de ser tenidas en cuenta.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Magnani","given":"Matthew"}],"citation-key":"magnani2014","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.7183/2326-3768.2.4.285","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",11]]},"language":"en","page":"285-297","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Three-Dimensional Alternatives to Lithic Illustration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/threedimensional-alternatives-to-lithic-illustration/19BCC15188CAEFA1DBB943BE8F6E836E","volume":"2"},
  {"id":"magnini2019","abstract":"Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is rapidly emerging as a valuable method for integrating the data processing techniques and GIS approaches classically employed in archaeology. OBIA is intended to replicate human perception by using a protocol of (semi)automated image segmentation and classification. However, the lack of a theoretical background adapted to the specificities of the archaeological discipline is still preventing researchers from finding a shared language and a common protocol of investigation necessary to allow the comparability of the results. This article discusses a series of crucial theoretical issues linked to the incompleteness and the equi-/multi-finality of the archaeological record and introduces the core concept of Diachronic Semantic Models (DhSM) as a means to integrate the long-term evolution of the archaeological landscape in the conceptual, digital and real-world frameworks of the object-based approach. We also present an assessment of the limits and potential of this method, built from a set of case studies from published and unpublished research. Finally, we propose a general workflow of an Archaeological Object-Based Image Analysis (ArchaeOBIA) project, designed for stimulating the development of an operational routine for object-based applications in archaeology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Magnini","given":"Luigi"},{"family":"Bettineschi","given":"Cinzia"}],"citation-key":"magnini2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2019.04.005","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,1]]},"page":"10-22","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Theory and practice for an object-based approach in archaeological remote sensing","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440319300354","volume":"107"},

  {"id":"maitner2024","abstract":"Biologists increasingly rely on computer code to collect and analyze their data, reinforcing the importance of published code for transparency, reproducibility, training, and a basis for further work. Here, we conduct a literature review estimating temporal trends in code sharing in ecology and evolution publications since 2010, and test for an influence of code sharing on citation rate. We find that code is rarely published (only 6% of papers), with little improvement over time. We also found there may be incentives to publish code: Publications that share code have tended to be low-impact initially, but accumulate citations faster, compensating for this deficit. Studies that additionally meet other Open Science criteria, open-access publication, or data sharing, have still higher citation rates, with publications meeting all three criteria (code sharing, data sharing, and open access publication) tending to have the most citations and highest rate of citation accumulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Maitner","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Santos Andrade","given":"Paul Efren"},{"family":"Lei","given":"Luna"},{"family":"Kass","given":"Jamie"},{"family":"Owens","given":"Hannah L."},{"family":"Barbosa","given":"George C.

  {"id":"makin2021","abstract":"Existing discourse on the research-practice gap underplays the role of practitioners and assumes that the existence of the gap is due primarily to deficiencies in theory. This conceptual paper problematizes this assumption and explores in practice why practitioners have not been able to harness and apply insights from organisation theory (OT) and information systems (IS) research . Drawing on the concept of knowledge boundaries, several key arguments are made. Firstly, a pragmatic knowledge boundary divides academics and practitioners. Secondly, the novelty of OT and IS research at this knowledge boundary hinders practitioners' ability to constructively assess it, which results in contradictions and discourages its application in practice. Finally, when academics and practitioners collaborate to promote deeper engagement, and when effective boundary-spanning objects are used, there are signs that the research-practice gap can be overcome. These arguments are illustrated through a case-study of employees in a medium-sized IT consulting company.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Makin","given":"Samuel"}],"citation-key":"makin2021","container-title":"Information and Organization","container-title-short":"Information and Organization","DOI":"10.1016/j.infoandorg.2020.100334","ISSN":"1471-7727","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,10]]},"language":"en","page":"100334","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The research-practice gap as a pragmatic knowledge boundary","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471772720300580"},

In this paper, I explore the question of whether strategies that reduce quartz fragmentation were used in prehistory and present data that suggest that this was often the case. It has been suggested that due to its fragmentation proneness vein quartz should have been avoided by highly mobile groups when raw materials of better flakeability and controllability were available because of higher transportation costs and greater risk of raw material failure when using quartz. The data presented here shows that quartz nevertheless was not always avoided by highly mobile groups but that the inclusion of quartz into the raw material base necessitated the acceptance of thicker tools when using relatively large flake blanks, or the use of technological strategies that compensated for the risk of failure when relatively thin quartz flakes were in use.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Manninen","given":"Mikael A."}],"citation-key":"manninen2016","collection-title":"New approaches to the study of Quartz lithic industries","container-title":"Quaternary International","container-title-short":"Quaternary International","DOI":"10.1016/j.quaint.2015.12.096","ISSN":"1040-6182","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12,7]]},"page":"24-31","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The effect of raw material properties on flake and flake-tool dimensions: A comparison between quartz and chert","title-short":"The effect of raw material properties on flake and flake-tool dimensions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618216002093","volume":"424"},

  {"id":"manovich1999","abstract":"After the novel, and subsequently cinema, privileged narrative as the key form of                 cultural expression of the modern age, the computer age introduces its correlate -                 database. Many new media objects do not tell stories; they don't have a beginning or                 end; in fact, they don't have any development, thematically, formally or otherwise                 which would organise their elements into a sequence. Instead, they are collections                 of individual items, where every item has the same significance as any other. Why do                 new media favour database form over others? Can we explain its popularity by                 analysing the specificity of the digital medium and computer programming? What is                 the relationship between database and another form, which has traditionally                 dominated human culture - narrative? In addressing these questions, the article                 discusses the connection between the computer's ontology - the way the computer's                 organisation of data represents the world - and the new cultural forms privileged by                 computer culture such as database. Saussure's notions of the paradigm and the                 syntagm are used to theorise the relationship between database and narrative. A                 possible history of a database form in modern media and culture in general is                 sketched. The last part of the article addreses the tension between database and                 narrative in the history of cinema. It considers the works of such filmmakers as                 Peter Greenaway and Dziga Vertov as part of the tradition which can be called                 'database cinema'. This cinema tries to merge databases and narrative into a new                 form, thus anticipating one of the key problems of new media art.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Manovich","given":"Lev"}],"citation-key":"manovich1999","container-title":"Convergence","container-title-short":"Convergence","DOI":"10.1177/135485659900500206","ISSN":"1354-8565","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"80-99","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Database as Symbolic Form","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/135485659900500206","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"manovich2001","abstract":"A stimulating, eclectic accountof new media that finds its origins in old media, particularly the cinema. In this book Lev Manovich offers the first systematic and rigorous theory of new media. He places new media within the histories of visual and media cultures of the last few centuries. He discusses new media's reliance on conventions of old media, such as the rectangular frame and mobile camera, and shows how new media works create the illusion of reality, address the viewer, and represent space. He also analyzes categories and forms unique to new media, such as interface and database. Manovich uses concepts from film theory, art history, literary theory, and computer science and also develops new theoretical constructs, such as cultural interface, spatial montage, and cinegratography. The theory and history of cinema play a particularly important role in the book. Among other topics, Manovich discusses parallels between the histories of cinema and of new media, digital cinema, screen and montage in cinema and in new media, and historical ties between avant-garde film and new media.","author":[{"family":"Manovich","given":"Lev"}],"citation-key":"manovich2001","ISBN":"978-0-262-63255-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"number-of-pages":"492","publisher":"MIT Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Language of New Media","type":"book"},

  {"id":"manzo2018","abstract":"The recent literature on “complex contagions” challenges Granovetter’s classic hypothesis on the strength of weak ties and argues that, when the actors’ choice requires reinforcement from several sources, it is the structure of strong ties that really matters to sustain rapid and wide diffusion. The paper contributes to this debate by reporting on a small-N study that relies on a unique combination of ethnographic data, social network analysis, and computational models. In particular, we investigate two rural populations of Indian and Kenyan potters who have to decide whether to adopt new, objectively more efficient and economically more attractive, technical/stylistic options. Qualitative field data show that religious sub-communities within the Indian and Kenyan populations exhibit markedly different diffusion rates and speed over the last thirty years. To account for these differences, we first analyze empirically observed kinship networks and advice networks, and, then, we recreate the actual aggregate diffusion curves through a series of empirically calibrated agent-based simulations. Combining the two methods, we show that, while single exposure through heterophilious weak ties were sufficient to initiate the diffusion process, large bridges made of strong ties can in fact lead to faster or slower diffusion depending on the type of signals circulating in the network. We conclude that, even in presence of “complex contagions,” dense local ties cannot be regarded as a sufficient condition for faster diffusion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Manzo","given":"Gianluca"},{"family":"Gabbriellini","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Roux","given":"Valentine"},{"family":"M’Mbogori","given":"Freda Nkirote"}],"citation-key":"manzo2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-018-9393-z","ISSN":"1573-7764","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1109-1154","source":"Springer Link","title":"Complex Contagions and the Diffusion of Innovations: Evidence from a Small-N Study","title-short":"Complex Contagions and the Diffusion of Innovations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-018-9393-z","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"marila2017","abstract":"The rapid development of natural scientific methods coupled with the recent popularity of new materialist philosophies in archaeological theory has raised discussion about the possibility of a return to empiricism in archaeology. While empiricism as a pragmatic philosophy is in line with archaeology’s hands-on character, the recent development has left some concerned about the vanishing role of vagueness and ambiguity in archaeological interpretation. In this setting, the exactitude of natural scientific methods is seen as a process of simplification that compromises the tacit dimensions of archaeological knowledge. This article discusses vagueness as an elementary part of all archaeological knowledge formation, with a particular emphasis on the role of perception and senses in finds analysis.

The paper focuses on the significance of modern methods of imaging in archaeological research. New digital technologies have made it possible to create images that exist only through the use of 3D graphics programs. The depictions do not have their counterparts in reality. The problem draws the attention to the questions raised by philosophers regarding the existence and limits of cognition. Synthetic images, as fictitious depictions, have been endowed with great authority of “probability”.

They present the information acquired through an analysis of sources and reference material as well as details about the methods used, technical solutions and parameters adopted. Basing on the example of the visualisation of a medieval house discovered at the Siecieborowice site (Poland), the formulated hypotheses and the entire research procedure were presented in graphic form using Coggle mind mapping software.

People make their territories, houses, living spaces, and work spaces their own by consciously modifying them in terms of their effects on the senses, their utility, and their economic value. For houses and other buildings, such efforts are invariably conditioned both consciously and unconsciously by the nature of the building materials already in use and potentially available, by the site, and by the technological capacity, imagination, and cultural sensibilities of the individuals who construct them. Similarly, how a group adjusts to a geographic area reflects much of the group's history, organization, and values, and in turn such adjustments influence that group's perception of the physical and the constructed environment. The landscape is the spatial manifestation of the relations between humans and their environment. Included in the study of landscapes are population agglomerations of all sizes, from isolated farmsteads to metropoleis, as well as the roads that link them.

These practices, common to different disciplines, are known as data analysis, and represent the most important set of activities in research contexts. Researchers use data analysis software methods and tools for generating new knowledge in their daily data analysis. In recent years, data analysis software has been incorporating explicit references in modelling of cognitive processes, in order to improve the assistance offered in data analysis tasks. However, data analysis software commercial suites are still resisting this inclusion, and there is little empirical work done in knowing more about how cognitive aspects inclusion in software helps researchers in analyzing data. In this paper, we evaluate the impact produced by the explicit inclusion of cognitive processes in the assistance logic of software tools design and development. We conducted an empirical experiment comparing data analysis performance using traditional software versus data analysis performance using software-assistance tools which incorporate cognitive processes in their design. The experiment is designed in terms of accuracy, efficiency, productivity and user satisfaction during the data analysis made by researchers. It allowed us to find some clear benefits of the cognitive inclusion in the software designed for research contexts, with statistically significant differences in terms of accuracy, productivity and researcher's satisfaction in support of this explicit inclusion, although some efficiency weaknesses are detected. We also discuss the implications of these results for the priority of cognitive inclusion in the software tools design for research contexts data analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Martin-Rodilla","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Panach","given":"Jose Ignacio"},{"family":"Gonzalez-Perez","given":"Cesar"},{"family":"Pastor","given":"Oscar"}],"citation-key":"martin-rodilla2018a","container-title":"Data & Knowledge Engineering","container-title-short":"Data & Knowledge Engineering","DOI":"10.1016/j.datak.2018.06.003","ISSN":"0169-023X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"177-204","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Assessing data analysis performance in research contexts: An experiment on accuracy, efficiency, productivity and researchers’ satisfaction","title-short":"Assessing data analysis performance in research contexts","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169023X16303512","volume":"116"},

Building on previous work, we present here a conceptual framework based on the ConML modelling language for the expression of information vagueness in digital humanities.

Having clear implementation guidelines allow us to employ search engines or big data systems (commonly implemented using non-relational approaches) to handle the vague aspects of information.

Back to the office, exploratory analysis of data is considered, and different interpolation methods are explained. We will stress the importance of a good understanding of how they work and to what extent are suitable for modelling a surface based in our data.

This limits the progress of archaeology because researchers cannot easily reproduce each other’s work to verify or extend it. Four general principles of reproducible research that have emerged in other fields are presented. An archaeological case study is described that shows how each principle can be implemented using freely available software. The costs and benefits of implementing reproducible research are assessed. The primary benefit, of sharing data in particular, is increased impact via an increased number of citations. The primary cost is the additional time required to enhance reproducibility, although the exact amount is difficult to quantify.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Marwick","given":"Ben"}],"citation-key":"marwick2017a","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-015-9272-9","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"424-450","source":"link-springer-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca","title":"Computational Reproducibility in Archaeological Research: Basic Principles and a Case Study of Their Implementation","title-short":"Computational Reproducibility in Archaeological Research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-015-9272-9","volume":"24"},
  {"id":"marwick2018","abstract":"How do archaeologists share their research data, if at all? We review what data are, according to current influential definitions, and previous work on the benefits, costs, and norms of data sharing in the sciences broadly. To understand data sharing in archaeology, we present the results of three pilot studies: requests for data by e-mail, review of data availability in published articles, and analysis of archaeological datasets deposited in repositories. We find that archaeologists are often willing to share but that discipline-wide sharing is patchy and ad hoc. Legislation and mandates are effective at increasing data sharing, but editorial policies at journals lack adequate enforcement. Although most of the data available at repositories are licensed to enable flexible reuse, only a small proportion of the data are stored in structured formats for easy reuse. We present some suggestions for improving the state of date sharing in archaeology; among these is a standard for citing datasets to ensure that researchers making their data publicly available receive appropriate credit., ¿Cómo comparten los arqueólogos sus datos de investigación, si lo hacen? Revisamos qué datos son, de acuerdo con las actuales definiciones influyentes, y el trabajo previo sobre los beneficios, costos y estándares de intercambio de datos en las ciencias en general.

Encontramos que los arqueólogos están a menudo dispuestos a compartir, pero el intercambio de toda la disciplina es desigual y ad hoc. La legislación y los mandatos son eficaces para aumentar el intercambio de datos, pero las políticas editoriales de las revistas carecen de aplicación adecuada. Aunque la mayoría de los datos disponibles en repositorios están autorizados para permitir la reutilización flexible, sólo una pequeña proporción de los datos se almacena en formatos estructurados para su fácil reutilización.

However, few archaeologists learn the skills necessary to conduct replication as part of their training.

  {"id":"mason2020","abstract":"Financial institutions typically avoid projects that will have a significant adverse effect on cultural heritage because it creates unwelcome risk and can affect their reputation. For bank clients, adverse project effects on cultural heritage can result in reputation risk, impede access to finance and insurance, increase operational costs, and jeopardize on-time and on-budget delivery of projects. To address this risk, financial institutions implement environmental and social policy frameworks that include specific requirements for the consideration of cultural heritage. This article examines the place of cultural heritage in the lending practices of 25 of the world's largest private-sector banks and its relevance for heritage practitioners who may be retained to provide advice, review or undertake fieldwork, and prepare studies in keeping with the private-sector bank policies and external standards described. The article concludes with a recommended best practice for private-sector financial institutions, a call to action for heritage practitioners to advocate for robust safeguards, and a call for support of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals by both heritage practitioners and private-sector financial institutions., Normalmente, las instituciones financieras suelen evitar proyectos que tendrán un efecto adverso significativo en el patrimonio cultural, ya que crea un riesgo no deseado y puede afectar su reputación.

Para hacer frente a este riesgo, las instituciones financieras implementan marcos de política ambiental y social que incluyen requisitos específicos para la consideración del patrimonio cultural.

  {"id":"mateos2019","abstract":"Stone tool manufacture and use are considered key adaptations in human evolution. The understanding of the biomechanical features and anatomical constraints of hominins during stone tool production have received increased attention in recent years. Similarly, research on the cognitive capabilities and manipulative complexity involved in toolmaking is in progress. However, data on the palaeophysiological constraints of stone knapping are scarce. The balance between energy acquisition and energy expenditure is a key factor to determine the fitness of any individual, and stone knapping is essential for resource procurement in any Palaeolithic society. Thus, the combination of energetic analyses and experimental archaeology provides an excellent tool to improve our understanding of prehistoric behaviours. Here, we present experimental research on the energetics of stone tool production that involves nine experienced subjects. Each subject produced three handaxes through direct hard- and soft-hammer percussion in a total of 27 experiments of toolmaking. All knappers were described by their anthropometric data, and their energetic expenditure was monitored in a breath-by-breath indirect calorimetry procedure. Because knapping is considered a light-intensity level activity, based on its MET (Metabolic Equivalent Task of Intensity) value, our results show some differences in net energy expenditure between direct hard percussion and soft percussion knapping during the configuration of a handaxe. Furthermore, our results suggest that the brachial index of the subjects represents an anatomical constraint for stone knapping because the lever of a shorter forearm reduces energy expenditure during striking and represents an advantage during handaxe production. Differences in the energetic efficiency of knapping, even if they are low, may increase the general fitness of the individual and, indeed, its survival.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Mateos","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Terradillos-Bernal","given":"Marcos"},{"family":"Rodríguez","given":"Jesús"}],"citation-key":"mateos2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-018-9382-2","ISSN":"1573-7764","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"561-580","source":"Springer Link","title":"Energy Cost of Stone Knapping","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-018-9382-2","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"mathur2023","abstract":"Starting in the 2010s, researchers in the experimental social sciences rapidly began to adopt increasingly open and reproducible scientific practices. These practices include publicly sharing deidentified data when possible, sharing analytical code, and preregistering study protocols. Empirical evidence from the social sciences suggests such practices are feasible, can improve analytical reproducibility, and can reduce selective reporting. In academic epidemiology, adoption of open-science practices has been slower than in the social sciences (with some notable exceptions, such as registering clinical trials). Epidemiologic studies are often large, complex, conceived after data have already been collected, and difficult to replicate directly by collecting new data. These characteristics make it especially important to ensure their integrity and analytical reproducibility. Open-science practices can also pay immediate dividends to researchers’ own work by clarifying scientific reasoning and encouraging well-documented, organized workflows. We consider how established epidemiologists and early-career researchers alike can help midwife a culture of open science in epidemiology through their research practices, mentorship, and editorial activities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Mathur","given":"Maya B"},{"family":"Fox","given":"Matthew P"}],"citation-key":"mathur2023","container-title":"American Journal of Epidemiology","container-title-short":"Am J Epidemiol","DOI":"10.1093/aje/kwad007","ISSN":"0002-9262","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,10]]},"page":"658-664","PMCID":"PMC10089067","PMID":"36627249","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Toward Open and Reproducible Epidemiology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10089067/","volume":"192"},

In addition, the compositional data was extended for the subsequent spread of tin-opacified glazes into Mesopotamia in the ninth century and Northern Iran and Central Asia in the tenth century. Using SEM-EDS and SR-Micro-XRD, the chemical composition and microstructure of eighty-five samples of opaque yellow and white glazed wares from Egypt (Fustat), the Levant (Madaba, Aqaba, Al-Mina and Raqqa), Mesopotamia (Samarra, Kish, Basra and Susa), Northern Iran (Takht-i Suleiman), and Central Asia (Nishapur, Merv and Samarqand) were investigated. These data confirmed that the yellow and white glazes were opacified by lead-tin-oxide (PbSnO3) and tin oxide (SnO2) particles respectively. Replication experiments were then conducted to imitate typical compositions of the analysed opaque yellow and opaque white glazes. Overall, the results posited the beginning of tin-based opacification of glazes in the eighth century in Egypt and the Levant, and provided explanations as to how the production of opaque yellow and white glazes in the Levant and Mesopotamia might have been technologically linked.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Matin","given":"Moujan"},{"family":"Tite","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Watson","given":"Oliver"}],"citation-key":"matin2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2018.06.011","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,1]]},"page":"42-66","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"On the origins of tin-opacified ceramic glazes: New evidence from early Islamic Egypt, the Levant, Mesopotamia, Iran, and Central Asia","title-short":"On the origins of tin-opacified ceramic glazes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440318303455","volume":"97"},
  {"id":"matsick2021","abstract":"Feminist researchers have long embraced the challenging, dismantling, and reimagining of psychology, though their contributions to transforming psychological science remain largely overlooked in the mainstream open science movement. In this article, we reconcile feminist psychology and open science. We propose that feminist theory can be leveraged to address central questions of the open science movement, and the potential for methodological synergy is promising. We signal the availability of feminist scholarship that can augment aspects of open science discourse. We also review the most compelling strategies for open science that can be harnessed by academic feminist psychologists. Drawing upon best practices in feminist psychology and open science, we address the following: generalizability (what are the contextual boundaries of results?), representation (who is included in research?), reflexivity (how can researchers reflect on who they are?), collaboration (are collaborative goals met within feminist psychology?), and dissemination (how should we give science away?). Throughout each section, we recommend using feminist tools when engaging with open science, and we recommend some open science practices for conducting research with feminist goals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Matsick","given":"Jes L."},{"family":"Kruk","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Oswald","given":"Flora"},{"family":"Palmer","given":"Lindsay"}],"citation-key":"matsick2021","container-title":"Psychology of Women Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/03616843211026564","ISSN":"0361-6843","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"412-429","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Bridging Feminist Psychology and Open Science: Feminist Tools and Shared Values Inform Best Practices for Science Reform","title-short":"Bridging Feminist Psychology and Open Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/03616843211026564","volume":"45"},

A robust research agenda in LIS has documented the data under‐sharing practices in which they engage, and the motivations they profess. Using theoretical frameworks from sociology to complement research in LIS, this article examines the broader context in which researchers are situated, theorizing the social relational dynamics in academia that influence faculty decisions and practices relating to data sharing. We advance a theory that suggests that the academy has entered a period of transition, and faculty resistance to data sharing through foot‐dragging is one response to shifting power dynamics. If the theory is borne out empirically, proponents of open access will need to find a way to encourage open academic research practices without undermining the social value of academic researchers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Mattern","given":"Janice Bially"},{"family":"Kohlburn","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Moulaison‐Sandy","given":"Heather"}],"citation-key":"mattern2024","container-title":"Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology","container-title-short":"Asso for Info Science & Tech","DOI":"10.1002/asi.24938","ISSN":"2330-1635, 2330-1643","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,7]]},"language":"en","page":"asi.24938","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Why academics under‐share research data: A social relational theory","title-short":"Why academics under‐share research data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.24938"},

  {"id":"may2015","abstract":"Archaeologists, as well as cultural and monument preservation organizations are currently increasingly endeavoring to open up their data stocks, which were previously only accessible to a small circle of specialists, for broad academic research and the interested public. In order to achieve this goal as effectively as possible, networked infrastructures and software tools are needed, which help users in the search and evaluation of found terms and concepts - in particular also because they are used differently in heterogeneous data collections. Different persons and disciplines can use different words for the same concept or they can work with differing ideas. This terminological-conceptual diversity is inevitably a hurdle,A practical approach to solving this problem, which has been pursued in STAR, STELLAR and SENESCHAL projects, is based on the application of the W3C SKOS standard for the integration of controlled vocabularies and the reference model CIDOC-CRM (see references). As a result, several national vocabularies to the cultural heritage are now available as SKOS-based versions, which can be accessed via the website HeritageData.org (see ref.).

After reviewing the kinds of archaeological geospatial data currently available I discuss the near future of GBD in writing culture histories, making decisions, and visualizing the past.

  {"id":"mchugh2008","abstract":"Digital repositories are a manifestation of complex organizational, financial, legal, technological, procedural, and political interrelationships. Accompanying each of these are innate uncertainties, exacerbated by the relative immaturity of understanding prevalent within the digital\npreservation domain. Recent efforts have sought to identify core characteristics that must be demonstrable by successful digital repositories, expressed in the form of check-list documents, intended to support the processes of repository accreditation and certification. In isolation though,\nthe available guidelines lack practical applicability; confusion over evidential requirements and difficulties associated with the diversity that exists among repositories (in terms of mandate, available resources, supported content and legal context) are particularly problematic. A gap exists\nbetween the available criteria and the ways and extent to which conformity can be demonstrated. The Digital Repository Audit Method Based on Risk Assessment (DRAMBORA) is a methodology for undertaking repository self assessment, developed jointly by the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) and DigitalPreservationEurope\n(DPE). DRAMBORA requires repositories to expose their organization, policies and infrastructures to rigorous scrutiny through a series of highly structured exercises, enabling them to build a comprehensive registry of their most pertinent risks, arranged into a structure that facilitates effective\nmanagement. It draws on experiences accumulated throughout 18 evaluative pilot assessments undertaken in an internationally diverse selection of repositories, digital libraries and data centres (including institutions and services such as the UK National Digital Archive of Datasets, the National\nArchives of Scotland, Gallica at the National Library of France and the CERN Document Server). Other organizations, such as the British Library, have been using sections of DRAMBORA within their own risk assessment procedures.Despite the attractive benefits of a bottom up approach, there\nare implicit challenges posed by neglecting a more objective perspective. Following a sustained period of pilot audits undertaken by DPE, DCC and the DELOS Digital Preservation Cluster aimed at evaluating DRAMBORA, it was stated that had respective project members not been present to facilitate\neach assessment, and contribute their objective, external perspectives, the results may have been less useful. Consequently, DRAMBORA has developed in a number of ways, to enable knowledge transfer from the responses of comparable repositories, and incorporate more opportunities for structured\nquestion sets, or key lines of enquiry, that provoke more comprehensive awareness of the applicability of particular threats and opportunities.","author":[{"family":"McHugh","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Ross","given":"Seamus"},{"family":"Innocenti","given":"Perla"},{"family":"Ruusalepp","given":"Raivo"},{"family":"Hofman","given":"Hans"}],"citation-key":"mchugh2008","container-title":"Archiving Conference","container-title-short":"Archiving Conference","DOI":"10.2352/issn.2168-3204.2008.5.1.art00004","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",1,1]]},"page":"13-19","source":"IngentaConnect","title":"Bringing Self Assessment Home: Repository Profiling and Key Lines of Enquiry within DRAMBORA","title-short":"Bringing Self Assessment Home","type":"article-journal","volume":"2008"},

  {"id":"mcmanamon2016","abstract":"Public agencies at all levels of government and other organizations that manage archaeological resources often face the problem of many undertakings that collectively impact large numbers of individually significant archaeological resources. Such situations arise when an agency is managing a large area, such as a national forest, land management district, park unit, wildlife refuge, or military installation. These situations also may arise in regard to large-scale development projects, such as energy developments, highways, reservoirs, transmission lines, and other major infrastructure projects that cover substantial areas. Over time, the accumulation of impacts from small-scale projects to individual archaeological resources may degrade landscape or regional-scale cultural phenomena. Typically, these impacts are mitigated at the site level without regard to how the impacts to individual resources affect the broader population of resources. Actions to mitigate impacts rarely are designed to do more than avoid resources or ensure some level of data recovery at single sites. Such mitigation activities are incapable of addressing research question at a landscape or regional scale.\n, \nLos organismos públicos de todos los niveles de gobierno y otras organizaciones que administran recursos arqueológicos a menudo se enfrentan al problema de muchas empresas individuales que afectan a un gran número de recursos arqueológicos significativos individualmente. Este tipo de situaciones se presentan cuando una agencia es la gestión de un área grande, como un bosque nacional, distrito de administración, unidad de parque, refugio de vida silvestre, o la instalación militar. También pueden surgir en relación con los proyectos de desarrollo a gran escala, como la evolución de la energía, carreteras, embalses, líneas de transmisión y otros proyectos de infraestructura importantes. Con el tiempo, la acumulación de tales impactos también puede degradar el paisaje o de escala regional los fenómenos culturales. Normalmente, estos efectos se mitigan como acciones individuales sin tener en cuenta cómo los impactos a los recursos individuales afectan a la población en general de los recursos. Acciones para mitigar los impactos rara vez están diseñados para hacer algo más que asegurar un cierto nivel de recuperación de datos en los sitios individuales. Este tipo de actividades de mitigación son incapaces de hacer frente a la pregunta de investigación en un paisaje o escala regional.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"McManamon","given":"Francis P."},{"family":"Doershuk","given":"John"},{"family":"Lipe","given":"William D."},{"family":"McCulloch","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Polglase","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Schlanger","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Sebastian","given":"Lynne"},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Lynne"}],"citation-key":"mcmanamon2016","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.7183/2326-3768.4.2.132","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",5]]},"language":"en","page":"132-148","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Values-Based Management of Archaeological Resources at a Landscape Scale","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/valuesbased-management-of-archaeological-resources-at-a-landscape-scale/FC7AAE375D4CFEFD0DD479437C12185B","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"mcmillan2019","abstract":"Archaeology and geology inherently intersect when attempting to determine the geographic origin of lithic materials manufactured into artifacts by ancient people. Obsidian, or volcanic glass, is frequently found in archaeological sites, and researchers commonly use the trace element characteristics of obsidian artifacts to identify their source. However, the trace element concentrations of obsidian flows are not necessarily unique, potentially leading to inaccurate conclusions when used in isolation, especially if all possible sources have not been identified and systematically characterized. In this pilot study, we assess variations among the trace element, structural, and isotopic characteristics of obsidian sources in British Columbia and describe a multiproxy approach for provenancing obsidian artifacts. Our approach combines the survey of an artifact assemblage using non-destructive techniques with further analysis of a pre-selected subset of representative artifacts using minimally-invasive analytical methods. The initial non-destructive survey step includes determination of trace element concentrations by portable X-ray fluorescence and structural characteristics by Raman spectroscopy. The minimally-invasive step includes the measurement of lead isotope ratios and more precise trace element concentrations with split stream-laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (SS-LA-ICP-MS) on only a select few representative artifacts. We tested this approach on 14 obsidian artifacts from an archaeological site in British Columbia. Our results provide multiple lines of evidence which indicate that two of the analysed artifacts likely originated from Mount Edziza, ~360 km north of the site, and all others likely originated from Anahim Peak, ~275 km south of the site. The combined use of multiple proxies significantly enhances confidence during sourcing studies and highlights the strength of multidisciplinary and multivariate geochemical approaches to archaeological challenges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"McMillan","given":"Rhy"},{"family":"Amini","given":"Marghaleray"},{"family":"Weis","given":"Dominique"}],"citation-key":"mcmillan2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.102040","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"102040","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Splitting obsidian: Assessing a multiproxy approach for sourcing obsidian artifacts in British Columbia","title-short":"Splitting obsidian","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X19304043","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"means2015","abstract":"Stewards of the tangible past are increasingly embracing technologies that enable digital preservation of rare and fragile finds. The Virtual Curation Laboratory (VCL) at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) partners with museums, cultural heritage locations, and collections repositories to create three-dimensional (3D) digital models of artifacts from archaeological sites distributed across the globe. In the VCL, undergraduate VCU students bring a fresh perspective unburdened by archaeological orthodoxy as they use a laser scanner to record artifact details, edit the resulting digital models, and print plastic replicas that are painted to resemble the original items. The 3D digital models and printed replicas allow for new ways of visualizing the past, while preserving the actual artifacts themselves. These forms of archaeological visualization enable the broader public and not just a narrow band of researchers to dynamically and meaningfully interact with rare and fragile objects in ways that would otherwise not be possible, empowering their own contributions to interpreting, understanding, and reimagining the past. We must embrace co-creation through virtual artifact curation and recognize that, while we sacrifice some control over the stories that are told about the past, more stories will be told and shared as pieces of the past become more accessible.\n, \nLos administradores responsables de la preservación del pasado tangible están adoptando con mayor frecuencia tecnologías que permiten la preservación digital de hallazgos frágiles y excepcionales.

Sixty faculty members from 14 different countries were interviewed by e-mail. For reality check purposes, face-to-face interviews with five faculty members were also conducted. Although the study confirmed Ellis's model, it found that a fuller description of the information-seeking process of social scientists studying stateless nations should include four additional features besides those identified by Ellis. These new features are: accessing, networking, verifying, and information managing. In view of that, the study develops a new model, which, unlike Ellis's, groups all the features into four interrelated stages: searching, accessing, processing, and ending. This new model is fully described and its implications on research and practice are discussed.

  {"id":"merritt2019","abstract":"The scientific replicability crisis has recently focused on bone surface modification (BSM) analysis, which underlies zooarchaeological and anthropological conclusions about the ecology and evolution of tool-assisted carcass consumption behavior. We review a recent blind test of inter-analyst correspondence in morphometric analysis of experimentally generated butchery marks that advocates algorithmic methods for diagnosing and measuring BSM in an effort to standardize methodology and minimize inter-analyst error (Domínguez-Rodrigo et al., 2017. Use and abuse of cut mark analyses: The Rorschach effect. Journal of Archaeological Science, 86, 14–23. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2017.08.001). This study overstates concern about the inaccuracy of BSM measurement and interpretation, concluding that BSM analysis is a subjective, non-scientific endeavor. Based on a minimally described sample of cut marks, it measures variables that involve inherent inaccuracy and subjectivity and overlooks how the contexts of experimental sample generation – particularly the difference between immanent and configurational processes – differentially affect cut mark morphometrics. We illustrate this discussion with experimental taphonomic examples focused on analytical context including sample construction and control over factors that affect cut mark cross-sectional size. Our analysis suggests the relationship between tool attributes and cut mark morphology is not generalizable to all experimental and archaeological butchery contexts. We show that our experimental samples capture metric variability observed in archaeological cut marks, but that intentionally incised marks and realistic defleshing marks differ in width and depth. Further, when controlling for factors that impact cut mark size including animal size class, tool type, butcher experience, and density across bone portions, overlapping cut mark widths and depths produced by phonolite and ignimbrite flakes lead to poor classification of marks according to causal flake material, which casts doubt on the ability to discriminate cut marks made by different materials. We build datasets that include diverse experimental contexts and suggest that meta-analysis can disentangle how multiple configurational factors contribute to cut mark morphometric attributes. Ultimately, progress in BSM analysis rests on inter-analyst replicability, which must be preceded by clear discussion of all parts of the inferential loop – from the design of experiments that generate actualistic analogues, to their use in supporting archaeological arguments. Otherwise, problematic expert knowledge traditions may mask arguments from authority in sophisticated methodological language and under-reported experimental context.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Merritt","given":"Stephen R."},{"family":"Pante","given":"Michael C."},{"family":"Keevil","given":"Trevor L."},{"family":"Njau","given":"Jackson K."},{"family":"Blumenschine","given":"Robert J."}],"citation-key":"merritt2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2018.07.003","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,1]]},"page":"71-79","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Don't cry over spilled ink: Missing context prevents replication and creates the Rorschach effect in bone surface modification studies","title-short":"Don't cry over spilled ink","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440318302589","volume":"102"},

One of the most persisting and common forms of recording is the archaeological diary. Despite having undergone transformations in form and function over the history of archaeology as a discipline, diaries are most often integrated into contemporary excavations in order to enhance reflexivity and to provide a greater context for understanding both the processes and products of these research endeavors. I argue that diaries do succeed in promoting reflexive archaeological practice, though not because of the greater contextual information they capture. Instead, the degree to which diaries repeat information recorded by other media embodies their integral role in reflexive archaeological epistemology. By comparing diary entries from Çatalhöyük, Turkey to the pro forma produced at this site, I demonstrate that archaeological diaries' power derives from their position in the local network of objects and inscription devices at archaeological sites and from how authority is formulated within the contemporary disciplinary framework of archaeology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Mickel","given":"Allison"}],"citation-key":"mickel2015","container-title":"Journal of Field Archaeology","DOI":"10.1179/2042458214Y.0000000002","ISSN":"0093-4690","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,1]]},"page":"300-309","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Reasons for Redundancy in Reflexivity: The Role of Diaries in Archaeological Epistemology","title-short":"Reasons for Redundancy in Reflexivity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/2042458214Y.0000000002","volume":"40"},

In light of the recent financial crisis, several commentators concluded that the continuing expansion of risk measurement is dysfunctional (Power, 2009, Taleb, 2007). This paper asks whether the expansion of measurement-based risk management in banking is as inevitable and as dangerous as Power and others speculate. Based on two detailed case studies and 53 additional interviews with risk-management staff at five other major banks over 2001–2010, this paper shows that relentless risk measurement is contingent on what I call the “calculative culture” (Mikes, 2009a). While the risk functions of some organizations have a culture of quantitative enthusiasm and are dedicated to risk measurement, others, with a culture of quantitative scepticism, take a different path, focusing instead on risk envisionment, aiming to provide top management with alternative future scenarios and with expert opinions on emerging risk issues. In order to explain the dynamics of these alternative plots, I show that risk experts engage in various kinds of boundary-work (Gieryn, 1983, 1999), sometimes to expand and sometimes to limit areas of activity, legitimacy, authority, and responsibility.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Mikes","given":"Anette"}],"citation-key":"mikes2011","container-title":"Accounting, Organizations and Society","container-title-short":"Accounting, Organizations and Society","DOI":"10.1016/j.aos.2011.03.002","ISSN":"0361-3682","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",5,1]]},"page":"226-245","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"From counting risk to making risk count: Boundary-work in risk management","title-short":"From counting risk to making risk count","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368211000225","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"miller-bonney2016","abstract":"Incomplete Archaeologies takes a familiar archaeological concept  assemblages  and reconsiders such groupings, collections and sets of things from the perspective of the work required to assemble them. The discussions presented here engage with the practices of collection, construction, performance and creation in the past (and present) which constitute the things and groups of things studied by archaeologists  and examine as well how these things and thing-groups are dismantled, rearranged, and even destroyed, only to be rebuilt and recreated.   The ultimate aim is to reassert an awareness of the incompleteness of assemblage, and thus the importance of practices of assembling (whether they seem at first creative or destructive) for understanding social life in the past as well as the present. The individual chapters represent critical engagements with this aim by archaeologists presenting a broad scope of case studies from Eurasia and the Mediterranean. Case studies include discussions of mortuary practice from numerous angles, the sociopolitics of metallurgy, human-animal relationships, landscape and memory, the assembly of political subjectivity and the curation of sovereignty. These studies emphasize the incomplete and ongoing nature of social action in the past, and stress the critical significance of a deeper understanding of formation processes as well as contextual archaeologies to practices of archaeology, museology, art history, and other related disciplines. Contributors challenge archaeologists and others to think past the objects in the assemblage to the practices of assembling, enabling us to consider not only plural modes of interacting with and perceiving things, spaces, human bodies and temporalities in the past, but also to perhaps discover alternate modes of framing these interactions and relationships in our analyses. Ultimately then, Incomplete Archaeologies takes aim at the perceived totality not only of assemblages of artifacts on shelves and desks, but also that of some of archaeologys seeming-seamless epistemological objects.","author":[{"family":"Miller-Bonney","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Franklin","given":"Kathryn"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"James"}],"citation-key":"miller-bonney2016","ISBN":"978-1-78570-118-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,31]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"169","publisher":"Oxbow Books","source":"Google Books","title":"Incomplete Archaeologies: Assembling Knowledge in the Past and Present","title-short":"Incomplete Archaeologies","type":"book"},

  {"id":"miller2015","abstract":"Preservationists and archaeologists often assess cemeteries for their research value as cultural resources of communities. Cemeteries hold significant interpretive and educational value because they serve communities as outdoor museums (Meyers 1996). The Cemetery Resource Protection Training (CRPT) workshop, developed by the Florida Public Archaeology Network (FPAN), engages the public by providing an archaeological perspective and hands-on experiences for local communities to aid them in addressing the real-world problem of neglected historic cemeteries. After completing over 36 workshops in 28 different communities, the CRPT workshop template has proven to be a highly transferable means to provide education and outreach to underserved communities and sites, as directed in FPAN’s mission. This paper considers cemeteries as participatory museums using Nina Simon’s (2010) co-creation framework. Following a brief summary of cemetery training programs and a review of the larger cemetery crisis in Florida, the rationale for creation of the CRPT program and building blocks of the workshop are provided for other public archaeologists to adapt for training cemetery stewards. Finally, the creation of training opportunities for nonprofessionals as an advance in public archaeology practice is discussed.\n, \nLos profesionistas dedicados a la preservación del patrimonio cultural y los arqueólogos, a menudo, evalúan los cementerios por su valor para desarrollar investigación como recursos culturales de las comunidades. Los cementerios tienen significado interpretativo y valor educativo, porque sirven a las comunidades como museos al aire libre (Meyers 1996). El taller de Formación de Protección de Recursos de Cementerios (Cemetery Resource Protection Training-CRPT), desarrollado por la red de arqueología pública de Florida (Florida Public Archaeology Network-FPAN), involucra al público a partir de la perspectiva arqueológica y de la experiencia práctica para que las comunidades locales les apoyen a hacer frente al problema real que representa el descuido de los cementerios históricos. Después de haber realizado más de 36 talleres en 28 comunidades diferentes, el modelo del taller de CRPT ha demostrado ser un medio de transferencia altamente exitoso que proporciona educación y que llega a las comunidades y lugares marginados, como se indica en la misión del FPAN. Este documento considera a los cementerios como museos participativos utilizando el marco de la creación en colaboración de Nina Simon (2010). A continuación del breve resumen de los programas de entrenamiento en relación a los cementerios y de la revisión global de la crisis en los cementerios de la Florida, la lógica que sigue la creación del programa CRPT y la construcción de los contenidos del taller se presentan a otros arqueólogos que trabajan con el público para que puedan adaptarlos al entrenamiento de los profesionistas dedicados a la preservación de cementerios. Finalmente, se discute la creación de oportunidades para entrenar a los aficionados como un avance en la práctica de la arqueología pública.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Miller","given":"Sarah E."}],"citation-key":"miller2015","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.7183/2326-3768.3.3.275","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",8]]},"language":"en","page":"275-290","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Cemeteries as Participatory Museums: The Cemetery Resource Protection Training Program across Florida","title-short":"Cemeteries as Participatory Museums","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/cemeteries-as-participatory-museums/E31C0C0F156A09B290135411BC46E95F","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"milligan2016","abstract":"Contemporary and future historians need to grapple with and confront the challenges posed by web archives. These large collections of material, accessed either through the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine or through other computational methods, represent both a challenge and an opportunity to historians. Through these collections, we have the potential to access the voices of millions of non-elite individuals (recognizing of course the cleavages in both Web access as well as method of access). To put this in perspective, the Old Bailey Online currently describes its monumental holdings of 197,745 trials between 1674 and 1913 as the “largest body of texts detailing the lives of non-elite people ever published.” GeoCities.com, a platform for everyday web publishing in the mid-to-late 1990s and early 2000s, amounted to over thirty-eight million individual webpages.

  {"id":"mills2006","abstract":"Constructivist grounded theory is a popular method for research studies primarily in the disciplines of psychology, education, and nursing. In this article, the authors aim to locate the roots of constructivist grounded theory and then trace its development. They examine key grounded theory texts to discern their ontological and epistemological orientation. They find Strauss and Corbin's texts on grounded theory to possess a discernable thread of constructivism in their approach to inquiry. They also discuss Charmaz's landmark work on constructivist grounded theory relative to her positioning of the researcher in relation to the participants, analysis of the data, and rendering of participants' experiences into grounded theory. Grounded theory can be seen as a methodological spiral that begins with Glaser and Strauss' original text and continues today. The variety of epistemological positions that grounded theorists adopt are located at various points on this spiral and are reflective of their underlying ontologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Mills","given":"Jane"},{"family":"Bonner","given":"Ann"},{"family":"Francis","given":"Karen"}],"citation-key":"mills2006","container-title":"International Journal of Qualitative Methods","container-title-short":"International Journal of Qualitative Methods","DOI":"10.1177/160940690600500103","ISSN":"1609-4069","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"25-35","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Development of Constructivist Grounded Theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/160940690600500103","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"mills2017","abstract":"Social network analysis (SNA) in archaeology has become important for a range of theoretical and methodological approaches that can more generally be characterized as relational. They are relational in that it is the ties between actors (or nodes) that define social connections. Archaeologists are currently employing a diversity of theoretical approaches to networks, and the perspective taken in this review is that SNA can provide insights into a number of different social processes using different theories. Following a brief historical overview, I discuss two aspects of SNA: the structural position of the actor or node, and characterizations of whole networks. I then summarize several broad classes of archaeological networks: historical, spatial, and material. I conclude with a call for more bridging approaches to span alternative theoretical and methodological approaches in the archaeology of networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Mills","given":"Barbara J."}],"citation-key":"mills2017","container-title":"Annual Review of Anthropology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-anthro-102116-041423","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"379-397","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Social Network Analysis in Archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-anthro-102116-041423","volume":"46"},
  {"id":"mills2018","abstract":"This article draws upon ethnographic accounts of female potters’ movement and intermarriage into multi-ethnic Pueblo communities in the U.S. Southwest to illustrate how marriage networks created opportunities for innovation through the production, distribution, and consumption of boundary objects. These objects did not define boundaries but facilitated boundary crossing or bridging by potters. I argue that the concept of boundary objects is more useful than hybridity for understanding the processes of culture contact and material culture diffusion. Archaeological evidence for late twelfth through thirteenth century migrations from the Four Corners to the southern Colorado Plateau is used to make a case for a high degree of intermarriage and post-marital movement of women. Such patrilocality challenges normative views of post-marital residence, including those employed by early ceramic sociologists working in the same area of the Southwest and even at the same sites. The case that I discuss provides a contrast to other Southwest examples in which conformist transmission was more common, and helps to solve a paradox in explanations of the Southwest Pueblo Sprachbund. I conclude that the concept of boundary objects complements formal social network approaches in archaeology by bringing out the active role of objects in linking social actors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Mills","given":"Barbara J."}],"citation-key":"mills2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-018-9392-0","ISSN":"1573-7764","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1051-1086","source":"Springer Link","title":"Intermarriage, Technological Diffusion, and Boundary Objects in the U.S. Southwest","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-018-9392-0","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"mimisson2014","abstract":"Recently a fierce criticism has been aimed at social history and how it has been directed by various forms of grand narratives. Some microhistorians have lent this critique a voice from where a new theoretical framework, the singularization of history, has arisen. It rejects the notion that fragments of historical data can be put together into rational and coherent metanarratives but emphasizes the need for an inward focus on the material at hand and interpretations free from the idealized perspectives on the past. Consequently, it involves scrutinizing the details of each event and object of research, looking for meaning within them rather than in larger contexts. In this paper, we intend to pose the question of if or how the idea of the singularization of history may apply to archaeology. Furthermore, we want to reflect upon the possibilities of a ‘singularized archaeology' that regards the things at hand by honouring the nature of singularities, their relations and ontological constitution and how they reassemble into composite entities like practices, events or persons.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Mímisson","given":"Kristján"},{"family":"Magnússon","given":"Sigurður Gylfi"}],"citation-key":"mimisson2014","container-title":"Journal of Social Archaeology","container-title-short":"Journal of Social Archaeology","DOI":"10.1177/1469605314527393","ISSN":"1469-6053","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"131-156","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Singularizing the past: The history and archaeology of the small and ordinary","title-short":"Singularizing the past","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1469605314527393","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"molloy2018","abstract":"The role of 3D modelling in archaeology is increasing exponentially, from fieldwork to architecture to material culture studies. For the study of archaeological objects the roles of digital and print models for public engagement has been much considered in recent literature. For model makers, focus has typically been placed on exceptional and visually striking objects with inherent appeal. In contrast, this paper explores some of the potential roles for 3D digital models for routine artefact research and publication. Particular emphasis is placed on the challenges this technology raises for archaeological theory and practice. Following a consideration of how 3D models relate to established illustration and photographic traditions, the paper evaluates some of the unique features of 3D models, focussing on both positive and negative aspects of these. This is followed by a discussion of the role of potential research connections between digital and craft models in experimental research. Our overall objective is to emphasise a need to engage with the ways in which this gradual development has begun to change aspects of longestablished workflows. In turn, the increasing use of this technology is argued to have wider ramifications for the development of archaeology, and material culture studies in particular, as a discipline that requires reflection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Molloy","given":"Barry"},{"family":"Milić","given":"Marina"}],"citation-key":"molloy2018","container-title":"Open Archaeology","DOI":"10.1515/opar-2018-0006","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"97–113","source":"DeGruyter","title":"Wonderful Things?

They are often overlooked as objects of analysis themselves, and tend to be seen simply as adjuncts to the text. Images, however, are not passive, and have a direct impact that engages attention in ways independent of any specific text. Advertising, entertainment and propaganda have realised the extent of this power to shape ideas, but the scientific community has hitherto neglected the ways in which visual material conditions the ways in which we think. With subjects including prehistoric artworks, excavation illustrations, artists' impressions of ancient sites and peoples and contemporary landscapes, photographs and drawings, this study explores how pictures shape our perceptions and our expectations of the past. This volume is not concerned with the accuracy of pictures from the past or directly about the past itself, but is interested instead in why certain subjects are selected, why they are depicted the way they are, and what effects such images have on our idea of the past. This collection constitutes a ground-breaking study in historiography which radically reassesses the ways that history can be written.","author":[{"family":"Molyneaux","given":"Brian"}],"citation-key":"molyneaux1997","ISBN":"978-0-415-10675-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"294","publisher":"Psychology Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Cultural Life of Images: Visual Representation in Archaeology","title-short":"The Cultural Life of Images","type":"book"},
  {"id":"monego2019","abstract":"This work aims at showing the fundamental role that the integration of geomatic techniques and a specific multidisciplinary approach could have in the study, conservation and valorization of ancient buildings, by presenting some results of a research conducted in Pompeii, one of the most important city of the ancient world. The research, which is part of a wider project headed by the University of Padova (MACH -Multidisciplinary methodological Approaches to the knowledge, conservation and valorization of Cultural Heritage), aims at studying the Sarno Baths, an architectural complex located in the south-western part of Pompeii (Regio VIII, Insula 2, house numbers from 17 to 21). The complex is composed by a set of buildings, the main of which is made of five floors. It leans against the southern rocky front of the city and has a façade which is about 15 m high and 40 m wide. Different research units of the University of Padua were involved in the project and different aspects were dealt with: survey and structural analysis, archaeological excavations, architectural analysis, study of frescoes and building materials. The Archaeological Superintendence of Pompeii has supervised all the phases of the project and has provided part of the data. As regard the architectural survey, after the verification of the existing 3D data acquired from the Superintendence, it has proved necessary to execute a new laser scanning survey of the façade, because of lack of data in some areas (due to the presence of vegetation) and to create a reference topographic network. A set of related spatial data and ortho-images were produced for the architectural and archaeological studies.

  {"id":"moon2024","abstract":"To reduce technical and task interdependencies, modularization has been considered important in OSS development. However, the existing literature implicitly takes a static view that software structure and organizational structure are established early on and change slowly over time, if at all. Such a view does not fully reflect the complex and dynamic nature of software development and tends to overlook the role played by human agents as they ramp involvement up and down over time. This study considers that coordination practice plays an important role in altering technical interdependencies in OSS development. This study investigates coordination practices that result in changes in software coupling—in particular, increases in software coupling. This study automatically analyzes the code in 72 software releases and 1033 task episodes of three successful OSS projects—GNU grep, IPython, and Scikit-image. This study takes a fine-grained practice-oriented perspective that views the way that the work is done as constituting the organization. In our conceptualization, OSS contributors use a configuration of multiple organizational elements, enacted and varying across specific episodes of practice. In line with this perspective, this study takes a configurational approach, uses fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to analyze episodes that led to decreases, no changes, and increases in software coupling during the inter-release periods in which the level of software coupling increased significantly, which we call focal period. We find that co-work involving multiple individuals tends to result in code that adds technical dependencies (increases in software coupling) during the focal period. To illustrate this beyond our fuzzy-set analysis, we present and discuss three episodes in narrative detail. The fine-grained, configurational analysis in this study supports the idea that the organizing process is ongoing enactment. In this study, OSS systems are an amalgam of code that builds up in different episodes each possibly different organizational configurations, rather than thinking of the OSS systems or projects as static or singular.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Moon","given":"Eunyoung"},{"family":"Howison","given":"James"}],"citation-key":"moon2024","container-title":"Information and Organization","container-title-short":"Information and Organization","DOI":"10.1016/j.infoandorg.2023.100499","ISSN":"1471-7727","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,1]]},"page":"100499","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A dynamic perspective on software modularity in open source software (OSS) development: A configurational approach","title-short":"A dynamic perspective on software modularity in open source software (OSS) development","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471772723000532","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"moore2017","abstract":"Open access (OA) is a contested term with a complicated history and a variety of understandings. This rich history is routinely ignored by institutional, funder and governmental policies that instead enclose the concept and promote narrow approaches to OA. This article presents a genealogy of the term open access, focusing on the separate histories that emphasise openness and reusability on the one hand, as borrowed from the open-source software and free culture movements, and accessibility on the other hand, as represented by proponents of institutional and subject repositories. This genealogy is further complicated by the publishing cultures that have evolved within individual communities of practice: publishing means different things to different communities and individual approaches to OA are representative of this fact. From analysing its historical underpinnings and subsequent development, I argue that OA is best conceived as a boundary object, a term coined by Star and Griesemer (1989) to describe concepts with a shared, flexible definition between communities of practice but a more community-specific definition within them. Boundary objects permit working relationships between communities while allowing local use and development of the concept. This means that OA is less suitable as a policy object, because boundary objects lose their use-value when ‘enclosed’ at a general level, but should instead be treated as a community-led, grassroots endeavour.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Moore","given":"Samuel A."}],"citation-key":"moore2017","container-title":"Revue française des sciences de l’information et de la communication","DOI":"10.4000/rfsic.3220","ISSN":"2263-0856","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,1]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","number":"11","publisher":"Société Française de Sciences de l’Information et de la Communication","source":"journals.openedition.org","title":"A genealogy of open access: negotiations between openness and access to research","title-short":"A genealogy of open access","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.openedition.org/rfsic/3220"},

  {"id":"moore2020","abstract":"The movement for open access publishing (OA) is often said to have its roots in the scientific disciplines, having been popularized by scientific publishers and formalized through a range of top-down policy interventions. But there is an often-neglected prehistory of OA that can be found in the early DIY publishers of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Managed entirely by working academics, these journals published research in the humanities and social sciences and stand out for their unique set of motivations and practices. This article explores this separate lineage in the history of the OA movement through a critical-theoretical analysis of the motivations and practices of the early scholar-led publishers. Alongside showing the involvement of the humanities and social sciences in the formation of OA, the analysis reveals the importance that these journals placed on experimental practices, critique of commercial publishing, and the desire to reach new audiences. Understood in today's context, this research is significant for adding complexity to the history of OA, which policymakers, advocates, and publishing scholars should keep in mind as OA goes mainstream.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Moore","given":"Samuel A."}],"citation-key":"moore2020","container-title":"Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology","DOI":"10.1002/asi.24306","ISSN":"2330-1643","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2019 ASIS&T","page":"856-866","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Revisiting “the 1990s debutante”: Scholar-led publishing and the prehistory of the open access movement","title-short":"Revisiting “the 1990s debutante”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.24306","volume":"71"},

Through an analysis of the objections to open access policies (specifically Plan S) that draw on academic freedom as their primary concern, the article illustrates the shortcomings of foregrounding a negative conception of academic freedom that primarily seeks to protect the fortunate few in stable academic employment within wealthy countries. Although Plan S contains many regressive and undesirable elements, the article makes a case for supporting its proposal for zero-embargo repository-based open access as the basis for a more positive form of academic freedom for scholars around the globe. Ultimately, open access publishing only makes sense within a project that seeks to nurture this positive conception of academic freedom by transforming higher education towards something more socially just and inclusive of knowledge producers and consumers worldwide.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Moore","given":"Samuel A."}],"citation-key":"moore2021","container-title":"Development and Change","DOI":"10.1111/dech.12640","ISSN":"1467-7660","issue":"n/a","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2021 The Authors.

Interactive virtual worlds such as Second Life provide tools and an environment that archaeologists can use to challenge static modes of representation and increases access to non-expert participants and audiences.

  {"id":"morgan2019","abstract":"As digital practice in archaeology becomes pervasive and increasingly invisible, I argue that there is a deep creative potential in practising a cyborg archaeology. A cyborg archaeology draws from feminist posthumanism to transgress bounded constructions of past people as well as our current selves. By using embodied technologies to disturb archaeological interpretations, we can push the use of digital media in archaeology beyond traditional, skeuomorphic reproductions of previous methods to highlight ruptures in thought and practice. I develop this argument through investigating the avatars, machines, and monsters in current digital archaeological research. These concepts are productively liminal: avatars, machines, and monsters blur boundaries between humans and non-humans, the past and the present, and suggest productive approaches to future research., Avec la généralisation des pratiques numériques en archéologie, qui deviennent cependant de plus en plus imperceptibles, l'auteur soutient qu'il existe un vaste potentiel de créativité dans la pratique de l'archéologie cybernétique. Cette discipline s'inspire du posthumanisme féministe pour briser les limitations de nos préconceptions sur les gens du passé mais aussi sur nous-mêmes. L'emploi de technologies incorporées et de médias numériques en archéologie nous permet de dépasser les limites des reconstitutions traditionnelles et skeuomorphiques produites par des méthodes plus anciennes, de bouleverser nos interprétations et de mettre l'accent sur certains points de rupture dans la pensée et en pratique. L'auteur traite ce sujet à travers l'examen d'avatars, de machines et de monstres tels qu'on les représente de nos jours en archéologie numérique. Ces concepts, liminaires mais productifs car les avatars, les montres et les machines brouillent les frontières entre ce qui est humain et non-humain et entre le passé et le présent, nous permettent d'entrevoir des approches fructueuses en recherche.

Die Cyborg-Archäologie ist vom feministischen Posthumanismus beeinflusst und bietet die Möglichkeit, unsere beschränkten Vorstellungen der Menschen in der Vergangenheit aber auch von uns selbst zu überwinden. Mithilfe der verkörperten Technologien und Digitalmedien in der Archäologie können wir die Grenzen der traditionellen, skeuomorphischen Rekonstruktionen der älteren Methoden überschreiten, archäologische Deutungen stören und gewisse intellektuelle und praktische Bruchstellen aufzeigen. Dies wird hier anhand von Untersuchungen von Avataren, Maschinen und Monstern in der gegenwärtigen digital-archäologischen Forschung herausgearbeitet. Solche liminale aber produktive Auffassungen, weil die Avatare, Maschinen und Monster die Grenzen zwischen dem Menschlichen und Nicht-Menschlichen und zwischen der Gegenwart und der Vergangenheit verwischen, stellen vielversprechende Ansätze für weitere Forschungen dar.

  {"id":"morin2017","abstract":"In archaeozoology, counts are generally considered as replicable data that accurately represent the initial abundances of elements, individuals, or taxa, although perhaps only at the ordinal scale. However, few studies have tested these assumptions with control data. To improve our knowledge of these issues, we conducted a blind test that involved the analysis of two large experimental samples composed of modern ungulate specimens of known element and taxon. Because the samples differed in level of fragmentation, the blind test provides substantial information on the impact of bone processing on faunal identification and quantification. Our results suggest that Number of Identified SPecimens (NISP) and Minimum Number of Elements (MNE) provide measures of abundance for whole assemblages and for samples limited to non-long bones that are both replicable and accurate at the ratio scale. However, the same metrics generally failed, even at the ordinal level, to predict abundances in analyses restricted to long bones and long bone portions. Given these mixed results, it seems judicious, in agreement with the current majority view among archaeozoologists, to treat faunal tallies as ordinal-level information. Despite issues of reproducibility and the difficulty of aggregating counts with MNE, the blind test also indicates that this measure is more robust at predicting skeletal abundances than NISP. Substantial variations in rates of long bone fragmentation and identification probably explain the poorer performance of NISP in the blind test.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Morin","given":"Eugène"},{"family":"Ready","given":"Elspeth"},{"family":"Boileau","given":"Arianne"},{"family":"Beauval","given":"Cédric"},{"family":"Coumont","given":"Marie-Pierre"}],"citation-key":"morin2017","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-016-9300-4","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"886-937","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Problems of Identification and Quantification in Archaeozoological Analysis, Part I: Insights from a Blind Test","title-short":"Problems of Identification and Quantification in Archaeozoological Analysis, Part I","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-016-9300-4","volume":"24"},
  {"id":"morin2017a","abstract":"Archaeozoologists commonly use Number of Identified SPecimens (NISP) and Minimum Number of Elements (MNE) as measures of anatomical abundances. According to a blind test examining the reproducibility and accuracy of identifications of ungulate remains (Morin et al., Part I, Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory, doi: 10.1007/s10816-016-9300-4), NISP provides estimates of skeletal abundances that are less robust than those based on MNE. However, although results were improved with the latter method, MNE is not free of problems. Here, we show through an analysis of paired NISP-MNE data for 24 classes of elements that MNE is prone to inflate the representation of rare parts (as measured by NISP), a phenomenon more strongly expressed in certain elements than in others. Moreover, some elements show a wide scatter of points, which raises issues of data reproducibility. MNE is also known for being seriously affected by aggregation methods. These fundamental problems severely undermine the value of MNE as a measure of abundance. This article introduces an alternative counting method that avoids many of the weaknesses of MNE. This counting method, called the Number of Distinct Elements (NDE), focuses on the occurrence of pre-determined, invariant landmarks counted on mutually exclusive specimens. Preliminary experimental results suggest that NDE counts are robust predictors of skeletal, and perhaps taxonomic, abundances. Moreover, the NDE approach eliminates the complex and time-consuming task of spreading or drawing specimens to identify fragment overlap. Furthermore, NDE values are additive and easy to calculate. Given these features, the NDE approach represents a compelling alternative to MNE in archaeozoological analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Morin","given":"Eugène"},{"family":"Ready","given":"Elspeth"},{"family":"Boileau","given":"Arianne"},{"family":"Beauval","given":"Cédric"},{"family":"Coumont","given":"Marie-Pierre"}],"citation-key":"morin2017a","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-016-9301-3","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"938-973","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Problems of Identification and Quantification in Archaeozoological Analysis, Part II: Presentation of an Alternative Counting Method","title-short":"Problems of Identification and Quantification in Archaeozoological Analysis, Part II","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-016-9301-3","volume":"24"},
  {"id":"morrow2024","abstract":"Thanks to currently available very high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) models via photogrammetric techniques as a primary method of archaeological documentation, constructing immersive, high-fidelity simulacra is imminently possible. This paper considers how the scale at which the human body interacts with immersive digital models is especially important for understanding the affordances and ergonomics of past things and places. The implications of this isometry between archaeological objects of analysis and emerging capabilities to interact with them through digital surrogates in the present are manifold. By enabling interaction with objects and contexts in immersive virtual space, such observational experiences create in silico engagements that are repeatable, distributable, and collaborative. In particular, it is the collaborative capacity of this technology that this paper explores using online immersive virtual reality (iVR). Collaborative online iVR is used in this research as a key instrument for enhancing understanding and reinterpreting the digital records of two archaeological sites under excavation in Peru. The case studies analyzed show a variety of cultural, geographic, and temporal contexts in the Andean region, which illustrates the broad potential of iVR for archaeological hermeneutics. Through iVR frameworks, the authors engage with embodied reconsiderations of Catholic ritual spaces within a planned colonial town in the southern Peruvian highlands and the pre-Columbian site of Huaca Colorada on the north coast. Synchronous scalar experiences that privilege the affordances of architectural space within digital models create opportunities for embodied experience and collaborative dialogue. A fundamental argument is the capacity to digitally inhabit these places and manipulate materials holds subtle as well as profound epistemological and hermeneutic implications for archaeological knowledge construction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Morrow","given":"Giles Spence"},{"family":"Wernke","given":"Steven"}],"citation-key":"morrow2024","container-title":"Virtual Archaeology Review","DOI":"10.4995/var.2024.19806","ISSN":"1989-9947","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2023 Virtual Archaeology Review","source":"polipapers.upv.es","title":"Thinking through the tool: collaborative archaeological bodywork in immersive virtual reality","title-short":"Thinking through the tool","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://polipapers.upv.es/index.php/var/article/view/19806"},

  {"id":"moutsiou2019b","abstract":"This paper presents the results of the compositional analysis conducted on carnelian beads from Aceramic Neolithic sites on the island of Cyprus. Carnelian is a rare raw material with alleged geological sources in the broader eastern Mediterranean–western Asia region. Most of these sources remain little explored and no detailed data concerning their geochemical signatures and elemental composition are available. Carnelian, albeit an exogenous material, is found in small quantities in lithic assemblages from Cypriot sites dating to 8500–5200 Cal BCE. The paper discusses these occurrences and uses non-destructive pXRF technology to (a) attempt to identify distinct geochemical groups (i.e. exploited sources) within these assemblages, and (b) use this information to infer the role of Cyprus within the broader eastern Mediterranean social landscape and exchange networks of the Early Holocene. Our analyses suggest multiple origins for the carnelian raw material and, more significantly, demonstrate that occasionally other materials, visually indistinguishable from carnelian, were used in bead manufacture. We consider the symbolic role of these raw material choices and propose that these early island communities engaged in a system of linked values with their mainland counterparts dependent on the materials exchanged objects were made of.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Moutsiou","given":"Theodora"},{"family":"Kassianidou","given":"Vasiliki"}],"citation-key":"moutsiou2019b","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.04.013","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,1]]},"page":"257-265","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Geochemical characterisation of carnelian beads from Aceramic Neolithic Cyprus using portable X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometry (pXRF)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18307594","volume":"25"},

During this period, emerging database technologies such as relational database models and menu-driven interfaces made it possible for users to keep a distance from their data. Alongside such technical changes, socially constructed discourse distinguished “information” from “data” and experts (including computer programmers) emphasized that data was too enormous and unwieldy to be handled by common users and prescribed that such users should concentrate on working with information; that is, data processed by the database management systems (DBMSs). By tracing the socio-technical forces that created data–information categorizations and the dynamic interfacing role played by DBMSs, the article attempts to understand how we arrived at notions about where and how our data are stored.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Mukherjee","given":"Rahul"}],"citation-key":"mukherjee2014","container-title":"New Media & Society","container-title-short":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444813495184","ISSN":"1461-4448","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"110-128","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Interfacing data destinations and visualizations: A history of database literacy","title-short":"Interfacing data destinations and visualizations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444813495184","volume":"16"},

I argue that mediation of cell towers in newspapers and lifestyle shows as potentially emitting cancer-causing radiation was key to shaping public perceptions about them. Through their disruptive nature, cell towers call into action a technoscience public consisting of a variety of stakeholders, including radio-frequency scientists, cellular operators, journalists, tower builders, activists, municipal corporations, and building owners. Technoscience publics and media publics intersect and shape each other, and this article presents “mediated technoscience public” as a theoretical framework for an ethnographic intervention in media studies.

  {"id":"muller2017a","abstract":"While quantitative performance indicators are widely used by organizations and individuals for evaluative purposes, little is known about their impacts on the epistemic processes of academic knowledge production. In this article we bring together three qualitative research projects undertaken in the Netherlands and Austria to contribute to filling this gap. The projects explored the role of performance metrics in the life sciences, and the interactions between institutional and disciplinary cultures of evaluating research in these fields. Our analytic perspective is focused on understanding how researchers themselves give value to research, and in how far these practices are related to performance metrics. The article zooms in on three key moments in research processes to show how ‘thinking with indicators’ is becoming a central aspect of research activities themselves: (1) the planning and conception of research projects, (2) the social organization of research processes, and (3) determining the endpoints of research processes. Our findings demonstrate how the worth of research activities becomes increasingly assessed and defined by their potential to yield high value in quantitative terms. The analysis makes visible how certain norms and values related to performance metrics are stabilized as they become integrated into routine practices of knowledge production. Other norms and criteria for scientific quality, e.g. epistemic originality, long-term scientific progress, societal relevance, and social responsibility, receive less attention or become redefined through their relations to quantitative indicators. We understand this trend to be in tension with policy goals that seek to encourage innovative, societally relevant, and responsible research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Müller","given":"Ruth"},{"family":"Rijcke","given":"Sarah","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"muller2017a","container-title":"Research Evaluation","container-title-short":"Research Evaluation","DOI":"10.1093/reseval/rvx023","ISSN":"0958-2029","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",7,1]]},"page":"157-168","source":"Silverchair","title":"Thinking with indicators.

Yet, despite the florescence of Mediterranean survey archaeology, this standard method has only been sparsely employed in Sardinia, with a pronounced focus on large, urban, coastal sites. Accordingly, we have little understanding of the ebb and flow of human settlement in the Sardinian interior. This represents a significant lacuna in the study of Mediterranean archaeology and history. Here, we report data from the first two seasons of the Landscape Archaeology of Southwest Sardinia (LASS) Project, a multidisciplinary project designed to correct this bias and to investigate how episodic integration into—but also disintegration from—larger economic and political structures drove sociocultural and socioeconomic change in southwestern Sardinia over the Mid-Late Holocene.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Murphy","given":"Elizabeth A."},{"family":"Leppard","given":"Thomas P."},{"family":"Roppa","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Madrigali","given":"Emanuele"},{"family":"Esposito","given":"Carmen"}],"citation-key":"murphy2019","container-title":"Journal of Field Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00934690.2019.1625247","ISSN":"0093-4690","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,19]]},"page":"1-16","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The Landscape Archaeology of Southwest Sardinia Project: New Data and Method from the Insular Mediterranean","title-short":"The Landscape Archaeology of Southwest Sardinia Project","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00934690.2019.1625247","volume":"0"},

  {"id":"nationalacademiesofsciences2018","abstract":"In the 15 years since the Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI) issued its declaration, there have been numerous efforts to promote and realize open science. A growing number of public and private research sponsors around the world are mandating open publication, open data, or both, on the part of grantees, with some variety in the specifics of their policies, including the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the European Commission (EC), and the Wellcome Trust. The University of Southampton maintains a repository of open science policies adopted by funders and research organizations (Figure 3-1; ROARMap, 2018). Supportive tools and infrastructure have been developed, including discovery platforms (e.g., Science-Open and 1Science) and browser-based extensions (e.g., Open Access Button, Canary Haz, and Unpaywall) (Piwowar et al., 2018). Academic social networks, such as ResearchGate and Academia.edu, provide an increasingly popular but controversial solution to author self-archiving (Van Noorden, 2014). At the same time, some articles are shared in copyright-violating pirate sites, such as Sci-Hub and LibGen, provoking debate over the efficiency and ethics of traditional models of scientific publishing (Björk, 2017b; Piwowar et al., 2018). The open science movement has catalyzed new investment, prompted controversy, and had a significant impact on the global research enterprise and its stakeholders. While underscoring the impact of existing policies and progress made, Figure 3-1 also reveals the speed of change and puts in perspective the need for additional efforts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"National Academies of Sciences","given":"Engineering"},{"family":"Affairs","given":"Policy and Global"},{"family":"Information","given":"Board on Research Data","dropping-particle":"and"},{"family":"Enterprise","given":"Committee on Toward an Open Science"}],"citation-key":"nationalacademiesofsciences2018","container-title":"Open Science by Design: Realizing a Vision for 21st Century Research","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,17]]},"language":"en","publisher":"National Academies Press (US)","source":"www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov","title":"The State of Open Science","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525413/"},

  {"id":"nativ2017","abstract":"The archaeological is regularly perceived in negative terms as lacking and deficient. It is fragmented, static, and crude, a residue of past living societies. Accordingly, much of archaeologists’ efforts are directed toward the amendment of these flaws. The present paper, however, argues that these so-called deficiencies are in fact constitutive absences. Whatever the archaeological lacks, it lacks by definition. It thus follows that working to render the archaeological “complete” is in fact an effort to undo it, to convert it into something else. For the sake of discovering the past, archaeological practice is a sustained effort to rid itself of the very phenomenon that defines it, consequently setting in motion self-perpetuating circularity predicated on deficiency and compensation. The reason for this, it is suggested, is the otherness of the archaeological, being at one and the same time a cultural phenomenon and a fossil record, a social construct and a geological deposit. This condition is so baffling that it is approached by transforming it into something familiar. The paper argues that understanding the archaeological should be archaeology’s first priority. Insofar as it is also the study of the past, this should be predicated on the understanding of the archaeological present.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Nativ","given":"Assaf"}],"citation-key":"nativ2017","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-016-9282-2","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"659-675","source":"link.springer.com","title":"No Compensation Needed: On Archaeology and the Archaeological","title-short":"No Compensation Needed","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-016-9282-2","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"neller2024","abstract":"Archaeologists seek to improve our understanding of the past by studying, preserving, protecting, and sharing nonreplaceable archaeological resources. Archaeological collections hold information that can assist these aims as long as they are properly cared for, identified, and accessible. One of the most serious barriers is the lack of large-scale coordinated efforts to make archaeological collections findable and accessible. This article suggests that developing and implementing the use of a standardized set of attributes regarding collections provides solutions and strategies to find collections. These attributes can connect and standardize existing archaeological collections from a variety of sources (federal and state agencies, CRM firms, Indigenous and descendant communities, and academic departments), serving the profession in multiple ways. Most critically, the baseline data can be synthesized to inform and direct priorities for future fieldwork, thereby decreasing redundancy in archaeological collections and improving curation efforts nationwide. Such efforts would also provide a resource to students and researchers looking to understand and interpret the past at multiple scales by encouraging more collections-based research and less archaeological site destruction. Access for descendant communities will also be improved with information about their cultural heritage. This, in turn, encourages transparency and collaboration between those communities and archaeologists., Los arqueólogos buscan mejorar nuestra comprensión del pasado estudiando, preservando, protegiendo y compartiendo recursos arqueológicos no reemplazables. Las colecciones arqueológicas contienen información que puede contribuir a estos objetivos, siempre que estén debidamente cuidadas, identificadas y accesibles. Una de las barreras más serias es la falta de esfuerzos coordinados a gran escala para hacer que las colecciones arqueológicas sean localizables y accesibles. Este documento sugiere que desarrollar e implementar el uso de un conjunto estandarizado de atributos con respecto a las colecciones brinda soluciones y estrategias para encontrar colecciones. Estos atributos pueden conectar y estandarizar las colecciones arqueológicas existentes de una variedad de fuentes (agencias federales y estatales, empresas de CRM, comunidades indígenas y descendientes y departamentos académicos) sirven a la profesión de múltiples maneras. Lo más importante es que los datos de referencia se pueden sintetizar para informar y dirigir las prioridades para el trabajo de campo futuro, lo que reduce la redundancia en las colecciones arqueológicas y mejora los esfuerzos de conservación en todo el país. Dichos esfuerzos también proporcionarían un recurso para los estudiantes e investigadores que buscan comprender e interpretar el pasado en múltiples escalas al fomentar más investigaciones basadas en colecciones y menos destrucción de sitios arqueológicos. También se mejorará el acceso de las comunidades descendientes con información sobre su patrimonio cultural. Esto, a su vez, fomenta la transparencia y la colaboración entre esas comunidades y los arqueólogos.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Neller","given":"Angela"},{"family":"Heckman","given":"Jasmine"},{"family":"Bollwerk","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Myers","given":"Kelsey Noack"},{"family":"Wells","given":"Josh"}],"citation-key":"neller2024","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2023.31","ISSN":"2326-3768","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,19]]},"language":"en","page":"1-9","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Making Archaeological Collections More Findable and Accessible through Increased Coordination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/making-archaeological-collections-more-findable-and-accessible-through-increased-coordination/FDC6CB2579EA329457F3F7342BBCBEA2"},
  {"id":"nelson2015","abstract":"Luminescence dating provides a direct age estimate of the time of last exposure of quartz or feldspar minerals to light or heat and has been successfully applied to deposits, rock surfaces, and fired materials in a number of archaeological and geological settings. Sampling strategies are diverse and can be customized depending on local circumstances, although all sediment samples need to include a light-safe sample and material for dose-rate determination. The accuracy and precision of luminescence dating results are directly related to the type and quality of the material sampled and sample collection methods in the field. Selection of target material for dating should include considerations of adequacy of resetting of the luminescence signal (optical and thermal bleaching), the ability to characterize the radioactive environment surrounding the sample (dose rate), and the lack of evidence for post-depositional mixing (bioturbation in soils and sediment). Sample strategies for collection of samples from sedimentary settings and fired materials are discussed. This paper should be used as a guide for luminescence sampling and is meant to provide essential background information on how to properly collect samples and on the types of materials suitable for luminescence dating.\n, \nLa datación por luminiscencia proporciona una estimación directa de la edad del último momento en el que el cuarzo o los minerales de feldespato se expusieron a la luz o al calor y que se ha aplicado exitosamente a depósitos, superficies rocosas y materiales expuestos al fuego en distintos contextos arqueológicos y geológicos. Las estrategias de muestreo son diversas y pueden ser individualizadas dependiendo de las circunstancias locales, aunque todas las muestras de sedimentos deben incluir una muestra segura que no haya sido expuesta a la luz y material para calcular la tasa de la dosis. La exactitud y precisión de los resultados de la datación por luminiscencia están directamente relacionadas con el tipo y la calidad de los materiales muestreados y los métodos de recolección de muestras en el campo. La elección del material de estudio para su datación debe incluir las siguientes consideraciones en torno a la idoneidad de poder reposicionar la señal de luminiscencia (blanqueador óptico y térmico), la capacidad de caracterizar el ambiente radiactivo que rodea la muestra (la tasa de la dosis) y el que no exista evidencia de una alteración posdeposicional (bioperturbación en suelos y sedimentos). Se discuten las estrategias de muestreo para la recolección de muestras de contextos sedimentarios y de materiales expuestos al fuego.

  {"id":"nerland2010","abstract":"This chapter focuses on one aspect of learning through practice in the context of professional work, namely on how engagement with complex artefacts and objects may involve practitioners in wider circuits of knowledge advancement and serve as a vehicle for learning when explored in situated problem solving. As a point of departure we argue that the permeation of epistemic cultures and practices in society has created a new context for professional work and contributed to transform collective knowledge resources as well as the institutional boundaries of professional communities of practice. As knowledge increasingly is mediated by abstract and symbolic inputs, and more advanced knowledge objects are introduced into the realm of professional practice, a creative and explorative dimension is brought to the fore. By introducing Karin Knorr Cetina’s notion of objectual practice as an analytical perspective, the chapter draws attention to the unfolding and question-generating character of knowledge objects and to how these qualities may generate explorative and expansive forms of engagement among professionals that serve to link everyday work with wider circuits of advancements in knowledge and practice.

  {"id":"neusius2019","abstract":"Data preservation, reuse, and synthesis are important goals in contemporary archaeological research that have been addressed by the recent collaboration of the Eastern Archaic Faunal Working Group (EAFWG). We used the Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR) to preserve 60 significant legacy faunal databases from 23 Archaic period archaeological sites located in several contiguous subregions of the interior North American Eastern Woodlands. In order to resolve the problem of synthesizing non-standardized databases, we used the ontology and integration tools available in tDAR to explore comparability and combine datasets so that our research questions about aquatic resource use during the Archaic could be addressed at multiple scales. The challenges of making digital databases accessible for reuse, including the addition of metadata, and of linking disparate data in queryable datasets are significant but worth the effort.

  {"id":"nicholson2023","abstract":"A fundamental task of archaeology is to address challenging scientific questions related to the complexity of human societies. If we are to systematically understand the processes that affect human societies on multiple spatial and temporal scales, research leveraging existing archaeological data is essential. However, only a fraction of the data from archaeological projects are publicly findable or accessible, let alone interoperable or reusable. This is the case despite statements of disciplinary ethics, availability of capable technologies for data stewardship, publications providing guidance, and legal mandates. This article introduces the FAIR principles for data stewardship in North American archaeology, which state that data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. We call for efforts to promote widespread adoption of the FAIR and CARE (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics) principles among professional organizations, publishers, data repositories, and researchers. We also call for adoption and implementation of requirements to adhere to these principles by governmental agencies, funding bodies, and other regulators of archaeological research. Ultimately, adoption of the FAIR principles in an ethical framework contributes to our understanding of our human experience and can lead to greater integration and reuse of research results, fostering increased partnerships between academia and industry.\n, \nUna tarea fundamental de la arqueología es abordar preguntas científicas desafiantes relacionadas con la complejidad de las sociedades humanas.

  {"id":"nicolini2009","abstract":"This article contributes to re-specifying a number of the phenomena of interest to organizational studies in terms of patterns of socio-material practices and their effects. It does so by outlining a vocabulary and strategy that make up a framework for theorizing work and organizational practices. The vocabulary is based on number of sensitizing concepts that connote practice as an open-ended, heterogeneous accomplishment which takes place within a specific horizon of sense and a set of concerns which the practice itself brings to bear. The strategy is based on the metaphorical movement of ‘zooming in’ and ‘zooming out of’ practice. The zooming in and out are obtained through switching theoretical lenses and re-positioning in the field, so that certain aspects of the practice are fore-grounded while others are bracketed. Building on the results of an extended study of telemedicine, the article discusses in detail the different elements of the framework and how it enhances our capacity to re-present practice.

In setting out to answer these questions, this book provides a rigorous yet accessible introduction to contemporary theories of practice, discussing their distinctive contribution to work and organization studies. Practice theories are a set of conceptual tools and methodologies for investigating, analysing, and representing everyday practice through written text, language, images, and behaviour. Drawing on a variety of theoretical traditions, they have explored the idea that phenomena such as knowledge, meaning, science, power, organized activity, sociality, and institutions are rooted in practice. The book first examines the origins of the idea of practice. Recognizing that a unified theory of practice does not exist, the central chapters of the book then discuss the theory and concepts of the main scholarly traditions that have, collectively, contributed to the 'practice turn' in social and organization studies. Each of the central chapters concludes with a fully worked example of the theory in application. Practice theories have become of increasing interest for management and organizational scholars in recent years, and this book is an advanced introduction to the complexities of the area for academics, researchers, and graduate students in organization studies, management, and across the social sciences.\"--Publisher's website","author":[{"family":"Nicolini","given":"Davide"}],"call-number":"HD30.4 N536 2013","citation-key":"nicolini2013","edition":"First Edition","event-place":"Oxford","ISBN":"978-0-19-923160-7 978-0-19-923159-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: ocn828774985","number-of-pages":"272","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Practice Theory, Work, and Organization: An Introduction","title-short":"Practice Theory, Work, and Organization","type":"book"},

Focusing on the production of news and games, the analysis shows that in economic terms platformization entails the replacement of two-sided market structures with complex multisided platform configurations, dominated by big platform corporations. Cultural content producers have to continuously grapple with seemingly serendipitous changes in platform governance, ranging from content curation to pricing strategies.

  {"id":"nikulina2019","abstract":"An analysis of settlement patterns for the cultural complexes of Eneolithic – Middle Ages in the central Baraba Lowland (Western Siberia) is presented. GIS technologies were employed to understand the spatiotemporal features for different cultural stages, with their particular kinds of economy. Geomorphological positions of 92 selected habitation sites, consisting of 101 cultural layers, were identified. The morphometric parameters and the Geomorphological Index invented by the author were calculated for each site. The general paleoclimatic trend was established in accordance with data obtained from a sediment core of the Lake Bolshye Toroki. The sites with common spatial features are combined into four groups according to their geomorphological position, morphometric parameters, and the GeoInd values. Localization of sites belonging to these groups is connected to climate of the region in the Middle – Late Holocene, and environmental conditions (mainly the amount of precipitation and landscape types) to some extent determined the choice of ancient humans to select places for settlements. Dry conditions are observed for the Eneolithic – early Bronze Age (Ust-Tartas and Bairyk Cultures). There was an alternation of dry and moderate conditions for the early – middle Bronze Age (Odino and Krotovo cultural complexes) and the late Bronze Age (Irmen complex). During the Andronovo occupation (the middle Bronze Age), the climate was dry. Moderate and wet conditions were typical for the Bolshaya Rechka and Sargat complexes (the Early Iron Age) as well as the Baraba Tatars Culture (the middle – late Medieval periods). The wettest conditions (alternation of wet and very wet conditions) correspond to the end of the Early Iron Age and early Middle Ages (Potchevash Culture).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Nikulina","given":"Anastasia V."}],"citation-key":"nikulina2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.01.018","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"page":"302-312","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"GIS-based analysis of settlement patterns for the central Baraba Lowland (Western Siberia, Russia) in relation to climatic conditions of the Middle – Late Holocene","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18305431","volume":"24"},

Previous studies and experiments have highlighted the impact that arable agriculture has on the preservation of archaeological sites, yet the ploughzone has also been shown in some cases to preserve important information. In this study, the value of the ploughzone was assessed through metal detecting and through sieving of the ploughsoil directly over one of the most productive areas for artefacts at an important early medieval site in Scotland. The purpose of the assessment was to gauge the extent to which removing the topsoil may lead to the loss of important information and to evaluate the extent to which strip-and-map approaches to excavation might contribute to information loss. It is the largest such experiment of its kind in Scotland and the experiment allowed an assessment of the type and condition of artefacts found in excavation compared to that in the ploughsoil. The study showed very few artefacts survived in the topsoil at this site with certain artefact types entirely absent. The study also showed the significant impact that even light ploughing has had on categories of objects such as metalworking moulds. The conclusions are that while cropmarks remain a diminishing resource, strip-and-map allows rapid assessment of these sites and where artefact densities are low this approach is unlikely to lead to loss of significant information.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Noble","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Lamont","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Masson-Maclean","given":"Edouard"}],"citation-key":"noble2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2018.11.015","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,1]]},"page":"549-558","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Assessing the ploughzone: The impact of cultivation on artefact survival and the cost/benefits of topsoil stripping prior to excavation","title-short":"Assessing the ploughzone","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18304589","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"nortoft2019","abstract":"This article explores the potential of ethnographic video narratives for collaborative learning in an interdisciplinary context. Previous research describes the area between tacit knowing and explicit knowledge as an area of “muddy water” that creates a space for constructing new understandings and knowledge. In this regard, video narratives can be seen as a pathway to feelings and other sensations, and therefore to tacit commonsense notions about the nature of practices. The question is how the methodical use of video narratives contributes to new understandings of practice. The article outlines a study in which two video narratives were presented in interdisciplinary focus groups in a nursing-home setting. The multilayered complexity of the video narratives, combined with different professional approaches to elderly care, opens up for diverse, opposing and detailed understandings of practice in the dialogue about the narratives. This diversity raises new questions about the nature of practice and seems to fuel a collaborative learning process. In conclusion, the article suggests that future interventions using video narratives would benefit from firmer facilitation and categorization of this diversity in order to enhance the potential for collaborative learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Nørtoft","given":"Kamilla"},{"family":"Nordentoft","given":"Helle Merete"}],"citation-key":"nortoft2019","container-title":"Visual Anthropology","DOI":"10.1080/08949468.2019.1568114","ISSN":"0894-9468","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,1]]},"page":"56-75","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Exposing Diversity: A Methodological Approach to the Use of Video Narratives in Interdisciplinary Practices","title-short":"Exposing Diversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/08949468.2019.1568114","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"november2010","abstract":"Relying on the fecund interface of three fields—studies in science, risk geography, and knowledge management—this paper notes first that the lack of understanding of the relationships between maps and territory and risks is an unfortunate consequence of the way the mapping impulse has been interpreted during the modernist period. Then, taking into account the advent of digital navigation, the paper discusses a very different interpretation of the mapping enterprise that allows a mimetic use of maps to be distinguished from a navigational one. Consequently, we suggest maps should be considered as dashboards of a calculation interface that allows one to pinpoint successive signposts while moving through the world, the famous multiverse of William James. This distinction, we argue, might, on the one hand, help geography to grasp the very idea of risks and, on the other, help to free geography from its fascination with the base map by allowing a whole set of new features, such as anticipation, participation, reflexivity, and feedback, now being included in the navigational definition of maps.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"November","given":"Valérie"},{"family":"Camacho-Hübner","given":"Eduardo"},{"family":"Latour","given":"Bruno"}],"citation-key":"november2010","container-title":"Environment and Planning D: Society and Space","container-title-short":"Environ Plan D","DOI":"10.1068/d10409","ISSN":"0263-7758","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"581-599","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Entering a Risky Territory: Space in the Age of Digital Navigation","title-short":"Entering a Risky Territory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1068/d10409","volume":"28"},
  {"id":"novotny2019","abstract":"Human skeletal remains hold a wealth of information about past life-ways, but their documentation and recovery from archaeological contexts is challenging. Four challenges face bioarchaeological field work: poor skeletal preservation; complex mortuary traditions; sub-par excavation conditions; and excavation time limits. Poor preservation often prevents the collection of metric data from skeletons. This project tested whether a bioarchaeologist with basic photography skills and excavation equipment could address these challenges using photogrammetry. Photogrammetry was employed at the ancient Maya sites of Say Kah and Chan Chich, both located in northern Belize, to document human skeletal remains and their archaeological contexts. Steps are provided for implementing photogrammetry in the field, as well as addressing challenges for using the technique during burial documentation. This project produced only one adequate 3-D model and no metric data could be collected. Overall, photogrammetry seems to be a promising method for bioarchaeological research because it is low-cost, effective, and fairly straightforward to learn. The technique was faster than traditional line drawing, but sub-par excavation conditions and dark, small spaces hindered the creation of useful models. Photogrammetry provides an excellent alternative to traditional documentation addressing the challenges of poor skeletal preservation and holding potential for unraveling complex mortuary traditions., Los restos óseos humanos contienen una gran cantidad de información sobre las formas de vida pasadas, pero su documentación y recuperación en contextos arqueológicos puede ser un desafío. Este artículo identifica cuatro desafíos que enfrenta el trabajo de campo bioarqueológico: la preservación esquelética deficiente; las tradiciones mortuorias complejas; las condiciones de excavación inferiores al estándar; y los tiempos limitados de excavación. Este proyecto examina como un bioarqueólogo con habilidades básicas de fotografía y equipo de excavación puede enfrentar estos desafíos empleando la fotogrametría. La fotogrametría se llevó a cabo en los sitios Mayas de Say Kah y Chan Chich, ambos ubicados en el norte de Belice, con el fin de documentar restos óseos humanos y sus contextos arqueológicos. Los espacios reducidos de las tumbas y las condiciones con poca luz durante la excavación impidieron la creación de buenas fotografías de los entierros de Say Kah; sin embargo, se pudo crear exitosamente un modelo tridimensional adecuado en un contexto mortuorio en Chan Chich. Se proporcionan los pasos para implementar la fotogrametría en el campo. En general, la fotogrametría es un método prometedor para la investigación bioarqueológica que vale la pena aprender, con planificación anticipada, para documentar restos en espacios pequeños y oscuros.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Novotny","given":"Anna C."}],"citation-key":"novotny2019","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2018.45","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2]]},"language":"en","page":"87-96","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Implementing Photogrammetry in Three Bioarchaeological Contexts: Steps for In-Field Documentation","title-short":"Implementing Photogrammetry in Three Bioarchaeological Contexts","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/implementing-photogrammetry-in-three-bioarchaeological-contexts-steps-for-infield-documentation/93FE7C4EA7BC23A2CACB80C77D818841","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"nungesser2021","abstract":"The key innovations of pragmatism are rooted in reflections on the interaction between organisms and their physical and social environments. In this chapter, I outline the pragmatist conception of interaction as it can be found in the writings of its founders – especially John Dewey and George Herbert Mead. Moreover, I illustrate how the pragmatist arguments influenced later theoretical developments and show in which respects the classical arguments need to be revised considering current research in various fields of study ranging from primatology and the cognitive sciences to developmental psychology and sociology. The chapter focusses on four core aspects of the pragmatist conception of interaction: First, based on the writings of Dewey, the different modes of how organisms interact with their environment are analysed. Special emphasis is given to human-specific forms of relating to the environment. Second, by drawing on the work of Mead, it is shown how human social interaction differs from that of other organisms and how these differences are connected to the emergence of perspective-taking and the self. Third, the development of perspective-taking, the self, and normativity in the course of socialisation is discussed. Finally, I describe the broader implications of the pragmatist account of interaction for the conceptualisation of society and show how they are taken up by the interactionist tradition in sociology.","author":[{"family":"Nungesser","given":"Frithjof"}],"citation-key":"nungesser2021","container-title":"The Routledge International Handbook of Interactionism","editor":[{"family":"Vom Lehn","given":"Dirk"},{"family":"Ruiz-Junco","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Gibson","given":"Will"}],"event-place":"London and New York","ISBN":"978-0-429-27676-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"number-of-pages":"12","page":"25-36","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"London and New York","title":"Pragmatism and interaction","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"ocallaghan2021","abstract":"With social media data widely available, researchers are increasingly incorporating tweets, posts, and blogs in their work. While easily accessible, the use of “public” posts raises important questions about the ethics of mining, storing, analyzing, and reporting publicly available social media data—especially when gathering sensitive information such as sexual violence disclosures. Online movements including #MeToo and #WhyIDidntReport emerged to shed light on gender-based violence. These movements generate large quantities of data with little consistency and oversight across research groups, disciplines, and review boards on data ethics. With the recent push in social science to publish data to open science databases, the concerns of feminist psychologists and ethical concerns of social media research with survivors have become more salient. In this article, we describe and address these ethical issues by reviewing existing social media sexual assault disclosure research and make concrete recommendations for authors seeking to use social media data. We also seek to address these ethical concerns by noting the work of some feminist researchers, but also by pushing researchers to do more for survivors through a survivor-informed approach to this research in an open science context. We propose four survivor-informed recommendations for research with this vulnerable population: (a) get input from survivors, (b) update ethics review boards, (c) maximize benefits to participants, and (d) utilize study-appropriate datasets with informed consent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,19]]},"author":[{"family":"O’Callaghan","given":"Erin"},{"family":"Douglas","given":"Hannah M."}],"citation-key":"ocallaghan2021","container-title":"Psychology of Women Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/03616843211039175","ISSN":"0361-6843","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"505-525","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"#MeToo Online Disclosures: A Survivor-Informed Approach to Open Science Practices and Ethical Use of Social Media Data","title-short":"#MeToo Online Disclosures","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/03616843211039175","volume":"45"},

  {"id":"okumura2019","abstract":"Geometric Morphometrics (GM) is a method originally applied in Evolutionary Biology studies, using the analysis of change in size and shape in order to better understand ontogenetic sequences, phylogenetic relations, among other issues. The application of GM in archaeological materials has seen a sharp increase in the last decade, mostly associated with theoretical approaches from Evolutionary Archaeology. This is not an isolated case, since most methods used by Evolutionary Archaeologists have been borrowed from Biology, provoking discussion with regard to the future development of Evolutionary Archaeology and its methods (Lycett, 2015). This article aims to discuss some concepts that have been directly borrowed from the application of GM in Biological Sciences and that have not been subject to much thought when used in Archaeology. Such concepts include homology and landmark types, the concept of modularity, as well as the idea of allometry. As much as archaeologists using GM can learn from past discussions held by biologists regarding the above mentioned concepts, it is high time for archaeologists to further discuss ideas concerning the use of these concepts in archaeological studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Okumura","given":"Mercedes"},{"family":"Araujo","given":"Astolfo G.

  {"id":"okune2018","abstract":"The current discourse around Open Science has tended to focus on the creation of new technological platforms and tools to facilitate sharing and reuse of a wide range of research outputs. There is an assumption that once these new tools are in place, researchers—and at times, members of the general public—will be able to participate in the creation of scientific knowledge in more accessible and efficient ways. While many of these new tools have indeed assisted in the ease of collaboration through online spaces and mechanisms, the narrowness of how infrastructure is imagined by open science practitioners tends to put the use of technology ahead of the issues that people are actually trying to solve and fails to acknowledge the systemic constraints that exist within and between some communities. Drawing on an analytical framework grounded in Black feminist intersectionality (Noble 2016), this paper highlights the need for more inclusive knowledge infrastructures, particularly in the context of sustainable development. Three case studies from the Open and Collaborative Science in Development Network (OCSDNet), are outlined in order to illustrate the importance of moving beyond a definition of infrastructure as merely a technical or physical entity. These cases, arising from research conducted in South Africa, Brazil, and the Caribbean, demonstrate how more sustainable and nuanced forms of collaboration and participation may be enabled through broader understandings of knowledge infrastructures. This paper further argues that leveraging the feminist concept of intersectionality when conceptualizing the development of knowledge infrastructures could be one way to move from narrow assumptions about standardized knowledge “users” towards more inclusive reimaginings of how knowledges can be produced and shared via networked technologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Okune","given":"Angela"},{"family":"Hillyer","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Albornoz","given":"Denisse"},{"family":"Posada","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Leslie"}],"citation-key":"okune2018","container-title":"ELectronic PUBlishing","DOI":"10.4000/proceedings.elpub.2018.31","issue":"Long Papers","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,20]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Episciences.org","source":"elpub.episciences.org","title":"Whose Infrastructure?

It is often assumed, for example, that things are entirely 'constructed' by social or cultural perceptions and have no existence in and of themselves. Bjornar Olsen takes a different position. Drawing on a range of theories, especially phenomenology and actor-network-theory, Olsen claims that human life is fully mixed up with things and that humanity and human history emerge from such relationships. Things, moreover, possess unique qualities that are inherent in our cohabitation with them—qualities that help to facilitate existential security and memory of the past. This important work of archaeological theory challenges us to reconsider our ideas about the nature of things, past and present, demonstrating that objects themselves possess a dynamic presence that we must take into account if we are to understand the world we and they inhabit.","author":[{"family":"Olsen","given":"Bjørnar"}],"citation-key":"olsen2010","ISBN":"978-0-7591-1932-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",7,16]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"215","publisher":"Rowman Altamira","source":"Google Books","title":"In Defense of Things: Archaeology and the Ontology of Objects","title-short":"In Defense of Things","type":"book"},

  {"id":"olson2013a","abstract":"Archaeology is a destructive discipline, and, unfortunately, the majority of methods employed by archaeologists to record and preserve the archaeological record consist of two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional (3D) subjects. Recent breakthroughs in 3D technology, however, have the potential to revolutionize the discipline. In recent years, multiple software suites capable of generating spatially accurate, photorealistic 3D models with a series of digital photographs have become available. Following a successful season of field testing in 2011, the Tel Akko Total Archaeology Project (Akko, Israel) expanded the use of Agisoft’s PhotoScan Pro—one of the commercially available software suites—to test the accuracy and suitability of the program for archaeological applications at multiple scales. After two years of field testing, it is clear that the implementation of PhotoScan Pro in archaeology facilitates unprecedented accuracy in field recording and digital heritage management, and provides a new outlet for the dissemination of archaeological data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Olson","given":"Brandon R."},{"family":"Placchetti","given":"Ryan A."},{"family":"Quartermaine","given":"Jamie"},{"family":"Killebrew","given":"Ann E."}],"citation-key":"olson2013a","container-title":"Journal of Field Archaeology","DOI":"10.1179/0093469013z.00000000056","ISSN":"0093-4690","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",7,1]]},"page":"244–262","title":"The Tel Akko Total Archaeology Project (Akko, Israel): Assessing the suitability of multi-scale 3D field recording in archaeology","title-short":"The Tel Akko Total Archaeology Project (Akko, Israel)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1179/0093469013Z.00000000056","volume":"38"},

New software makes it possible to create interactive photorealistic 3D digital images of stone tools in the field or laboratory without specialized or expensive equipment. These images can be replicated by 3D printers, and based on our experiments using three different printing media we demonstrate that models printed in ABS plastic are acceptably inexpensive forms that reproduce the artifact features required by specialists. The combination of image-based modeling and 3D printing will revolutionize the illustration of artifacts and greatly mitigate the need for extensive travel and help alleviate accessibility issues.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Olson","given":"Brandon R."},{"family":"Gordon","given":"Jody Michael"},{"family":"Runnels","given":"Curtis"},{"family":"Chomyszak","given":"Steve"}],"citation-key":"olson2014","container-title":"Lithic Technology","DOI":"10.1179/2051618514y.0000000004","ISSN":"0197-7261","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",11,1]]},"page":"162-172","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Experimental Three-Dimensional Printing of a Lower Palaeolithic Handaxe: An Assessment of the Technology and Analytical Value","title-short":"Experimental Three-Dimensional Printing of a Lower Palaeolithic Handaxe","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1179/2051618514Y.0000000004","volume":"39"},

However, developing innovative 3D imaging techniques for ceramic analysis is not the only aim of the project. Since its inception, Pottery Goes Public has been designed to involve a wider audience not only into the study of ancient potting techniques, but also into the very process of carrying out the research. As advocated by the proponents of a reflexive approach to archaeology, in order to make the past relevant to contemporary society it is imperative for the archaeologist to include all interested parties into every stage of the analysis, from the formulation of the research questions to the dissemination of outputs. In this sense, the deployment of modern 3D technologies proved to be an indisputably powerful medium of communication and interaction with the public at large. Performing live archaeological research with cutting edge tools is a key step towards opening up academic research to multiple actors and actively engaging them with the archaeological interpretative process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Opgenhaffen","given":"Loes"},{"family":"Lami","given":"Martina Revello"},{"family":"Kisjes","given":"Ivan"}],"citation-key":"opgenhaffen2018","container-title":"Open Archaeology","DOI":"10.1515/opar-2018-0004","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"62–80","source":"DeGruyter","title":"Pottery Goes Public.

  {"id":"opgenhaffen2022","abstract":"Digital-born research archives, data re-use, participation and the inclusion of academic and lay stakeholders in archaeological knowledge production. These are important topics that are increasingly addressed but often overlooked in the creative stages of archiving, be it data collection or the reproduction of an archiving practice. This creative practice is affected and changing due to the implementation of digital technology. These practices are reproduced in the design of the research archive and, as such, the impact of technology can potentially be scrutinised and traced reversely by analysing the uses of the archive. In addition, digital technology is believed to prompt greater inclusivity of diverse audiences. But how to reach that audience, and who is this “audience”? In this paper, emphasis is placed to reflect upon the practice of archiving of ongoing, post-excavation archaeological research with an audience, as opposed to well-established reflexive research into excavation and museum practices. As such, the concept of archiving as research process, rather than the traditional approach towards archives as data repositories is introduced here. As a case study to identify and assess potential change in a particular archaeological practice, the paper describes and analyses the archiving practice of the team of the Tracing the Potter's Wheel-project, from its inception in offices and storerooms to the archive's targeted manifold use as a place of knowledge production, data sharing and learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Opgenhaffen","given":"Loes"}],"citation-key":"opgenhaffen2022","container-title":"Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage","container-title-short":"Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage","DOI":"10.1016/j.daach.2022.e00231","ISSN":"2212-0548","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e00231","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Archives in action.

  {"id":"opitz2016","abstract":"This paper discusses the authors’ approach to designing an interface for the Gabii Project’s digital volumes that attempts to fuse elements of traditional synthetic publications and site reports with rich digital datasets. Archaeology, and classical archaeology in particular, has long engaged with questions of the formation and lived experience of towns and cities. Such studies might draw on evidence of local topography, the arrangement of the built environment, and the placement of architectural details, monuments and inscriptions (e.g. Johnson and Millett 2012). Fundamental to the continued development of these studies is the growing body of evidence emerging from new excavations. Digital techniques for recording evidence “on the ground,” notably SFM (structure from motion aka close range photogrammetry) for the creation of detailed 3D models and for scene-level modeling in 3D have advanced rapidly in recent years. These parallel developments have opened the door for approaches to the study of the creation and experience of urban space driven by a combination of scene-level reconstruction models (van Roode et al. 2012, Paliou et al. 2011, Paliou 2013) explicitly combined with detailed SFM or scanning based 3D models representing stratigraphic evidence. It is essential to understand the subtle but crucial impact of the design of the user interface on the interpretation of these models. In this paper we focus on the impact of design choices for the user interface, and make connections between design choices and the broader discourse in archaeological theory surrounding the practice of the creation and consumption of archaeological knowledge. As a case in point we take the prototype interface being developed within the Gabii Project for the publication of the Tincu House. In discussing our own evolving practices in engagement with the archaeological record created at Gabii, we highlight some of the challenges of undertaking theoretically-situated user interface design, and their implications for the publication and study of archaeological materials.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Opitz","given":"Rachel S."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Tyler D."}],"citation-key":"opitz2016","container-title":"Open Archaeology","DOI":"10.1515/opar-2016-0001","ISSN":"2300-6560","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,15]]},"language":"en","publisher":"De Gruyter Open Access","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"Interpretation at the Controller’s Edge: Designing Graphical User Interfaces for the Digital Publication of the Excavations at Gabii (Italy)","title-short":"Interpretation at the Controller’s Edge","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opar-2016-0001/html","volume":"2"},

This widespread transformation is rooted in a growing interest in showing data together with synthesis and argument, the importance afforded to public engagement, and the proliferation of digital platforms that enable creative presentations of scholarly work. In this context, we discuss our experience producing an excavation report that attempts to integrate several forms of scholarly and public-facing communication on a digital platform, and aims to engage audiences at multiple levels, while simultaneously facilitating data reuse and laying out the authors’ current interpretations. We consider the benefits and challenges of producing work in this way through the example of producing the Gabii Project’s first volume, A Mid-Republican House from Gabii, developed through a collaboration between the Gabii Project team and the University of Michigan Press.

The occupation phase 3 of Renaghju and phase 1 of I Stantari, both attributed to the Middle Neolithic (fifth millennium BC), have provided respectively 112 and 99 obsidian artefacts. With the aim of completing our rather lacunary knowledge of the obsidian consumption behaviours in place in Corsica during this period, the entire assemblages have been geochemically characterised virtually non-destructively using LA-ICP-MS at SOLARIS (Southern Cross University [SCU]). Our analyses revealed that, while the obsidian raw materials were exclusively sourced from the Monte Arci complex in Sardinia (SA, SB2, and SC sub-types only), rather different consumption patterns are observed for the two sites despite their comparable nature (megalithic sites) and geographical proximity (400 m apart). These differences in obsidian consumption on adjacent sites could be explained by their divergent functions (ceremonial site [Renaghju] vs. ceremonial locus and large settlement [I Stantari]), or eventually point towards the need for a readjustment of the chronological attribution of the I Stantari phase 1 occupation level.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Orange","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Le Bourdonnec","given":"F. -X."},{"family":"D'Anna","given":"André"},{"family":"Tramoni","given":"Pascal"},{"family":"Lugliè","given":"Carlo"},{"family":"Bellot-Gurlet","given":"Ludovic"},{"family":"Scheffers","given":"Anja"},{"family":"Marchesi","given":"Henri"},{"family":"Guendon","given":"J.

  {"id":"orbasli2013","abstract":"The increasing pressure for archaeological research and excavation to prove its worth in terms of economic value and social benefit must in turn be linked to broader definitions of what constitutes economic and social benefit and how it is measured. This paper considers ways in which archaeological sites can become engines for local and regional economic and social development that go beyond the expectations of tourism, and how this can be embedded in site management practices. It argues that tangible economic and social benefits can be generated when there is an active excavation, research, or conservation project and linked management presence at a site. Using two site examples in Turkey, the paper demonstrates ways in which direct (jobs, direct spend, access to funds, access to markets) and indirect (training, capacity building, empowerment) benefits can be achieved. There remains, however, a gap in how this benefit is quantified and how it is communicated to investors/donors, politicians and the public.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Orbaşli","given":"Aylin"}],"citation-key":"orbasli2013","container-title":"Conservation and Management of Archaeological Sites","DOI":"10.1179/1350503314Z.00000000059","ISSN":"1350-5033","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",11,1]]},"page":"237-253","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Archaeological Site Management and Local Development","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1179/1350503314Z.00000000059","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"orengo2019","abstract":"Archaeological pedestrian survey is one of the most popular techniques available for primary detection of archaeological sites and description of past landscape use. As such it is an essential tool not just for the understanding of past human distribution, economy, demography and so on but also for cultural heritage management and protection. The most common type of pedestrian surface survey consists of fieldwalking relatively large tracts of land, recording the dispersion of items of material culture, predominantly pottery fragments, by teams of archaeologists and students. This paper presents the first proof of concept for the automated recording of material culture dispersion across large areas using high resolution drone imagery, photogrammetry and a combination of machine learning and geospatial analysis that can be run using the Google Earth Engine geospatial cloud computing platform. The results show the potential of this technique, under appropriate field circumstances, to produce accurate distribution maps of individual potsherds opening a new horizon for the application of archaeological survey. The paper also discusses current limitations and future developments of this method.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Orengo","given":"H.

  {"id":"orlikowski1992","abstract":"This paper develops a new theoretical model with which to examine the interaction between technology and organizations. Early research studies assumed technology to be an objective, external force that would have deterministic impacts on organizational properties such as structure. Later researchers focused on the human aspect of technology, seeing it as the outcome of strategic choice and social action. This paper suggests that either view is incomplete, and proposes a reconceptualization of technology that takes both perspectives into account. A theoretical model—the structurational model of technology—is built on the basis of this new conceptualization, and its workings explored through discussion of a field study of information technology. The paper suggests that the reformulation of the technology concept and the structurational model of technology allow a deeper and more dialectical understanding of the interaction between technology and organizations. This understanding provides insight into the limits and opportunities of human choice, technology development and use, and organizational design.

  {"id":"orourke2017","abstract":"Much of the Inuvialuit archaeological record is situated along shorelines of the western Canadian Arctic. These coastal sites are at substantial risk of damage due to a number of geomorphological processes at work in the region. The identification of threatened heritage remains is critical in the Mackenzie Delta, where landscape changes are taking place at an increasingly rapid pace. This paper outlines some preliminary observations from a research program directed toward identifying vulnerable archaeological remains within the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. Coastal erosion rates have been calculated for over 280 km of the Kugmallit Bay shoreline, extending along the eastern extent of Richards Island and neighbouring areas of the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula. Helicopter surveys conducted during the 2014 field season confirmed that areas exposed to heavy erosive forces in the past continue to erode at alarming rates. Some of the calculated rates, however, have proven far too conservative. An extreme period of erosion at Toker Point in the autumn of 2013 has yielded a prime example of how increasingly volatile weather patterns can influence shoreline erosion models. It has also provided a case with which to demonstrate the value of using more recent, shorter time-interval imagery in assessing impacts to cultural landscapes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"O’Rourke","given":"Michael J.

In this regard, the archaeological record is most unique and helpful when viewed at broad comparative scales.

Still, by and large, interpretation remains limited to individual projects, and data integration across projects is nearly nonexistent. What would it take for CRM to achieve real data integration?

These other raw materials are not precisely characterized when they show diverse quality, type of raw material and different technical investment for knapping. Speculations about sources and provenance of these raw materials in Central Anatolia are diverse but rarely supported by surveys. This paper proposes the preliminary results concerning surveys in the region of Konya, Karaman and Beyşehir with the site of Çatalhöyük at the centre. To this purpose, this work proposes a new approach combining field observations, petrography and mineralogical study (by using FTIR) for the characterization of raw materials and flint sources. A systematic description of Cretaceous and Ophiolitic formations in Central Anatolia and an evaluation of potential raw materials sources during prehistory is presented here. The fieldwork allows us to observe typical flints of the region, but tectonics and metamorphism have modified their mineralogical characteristics and physical properties making them largely unsuitable for knapping. Jasper sources, in Ophiolitic formations, similar to the poor quality raw material exploited for chipped stone at Çatalhöyük site, are located around the settlement. Flint suitable for the large blade production observed at Çatalhöyük are not available in the area of our study; its provenance remains unknown.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Ostaptchouk","given":"Sonia"}],"citation-key":"ostaptchouk2020a","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2020.102433","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8]]},"language":"English","page":"102433","title":"Anatolian chert raw materials: Preliminary results and perspectives","title-short":"Anatolian chert raw materials","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X20302248","volume":"32"},

These assemblages typically require large scale, long term study to fully extract and contextualize meaningful data. However, when uncovered in CRM and foreign settings where remains cannot leave their country of origin, there is a need for quick, reliable data collection. Presented here is a recording system for use in field- and research-based laboratory settings. Utilizing visual forms and a minimal set of observations for skeletal elements from the cranium to the foot, the database facilitates data collection of fragment identification, age at death and sex estimation, dental observations, trauma recording, and taphonomic observations. A data dictionary is also provided, with definitions and value lists used in the database itself. The database has been used in field labs throughout the old world and by numerous researchers who have modified it to meet their own research needs. By presenting a minimal standard of data in a highly adaptable database, the recording system described here provides consistent baseline data in a user-friendly, quick-access format, Restos óseos mezclados y en estado fragmentario se encuentran en numerosos contextos en todo el mundo. Estos conjuntos típicamente requieren estudios a gran escala y de largo plazo para completamente extraer y contextualizar los datos significativos. Sin embargo, cuando se descubren durante actividades de gestión de recursos culturales o en contextos internacionales donde los restos no pueden salir de su país de origen, se necesita una manera confiable y rápida de recolectar datos. En este articulo presentamos un sistema de registro que puede emplearse en laboratorios de campo o de investigación. Utilizando formas visuales y un conjunto mínimo de observaciones para los elementos esqueléticos desde el cráneo hasta el pie, esta base de datos facilita la recopilación de información sobre identificación de fragmentos, estimación del sexo y de la edad al momento de la muerte, observaciones dentales, registro de trauma y observaciones tafonómicas.

  {"id":"overholtzer2015","abstract":"In recent years, scholars have convincingly argued, on both ethical and epistemic grounds, for the need for archaeological research “with, for, and by” descendant communities. Realizing such collaborative projects, however, is often challenging, and the prospect of beginning such an endeavor intimidating. This article shares a successful methodology implemented in the Xaltocan Archaeological Project (PAX) carried out in 2009–2011 in Mexico. This format—field crew-centered education in the context of excavations, culminating in a public symposium by all team members disseminating preliminary findings—is a simple, manageable way to begin engaging descendants. In addition to describing the symposium format, I discuss how I mitigated two major challenges to its implementation: (1) incentive or compensation (and, thereby, funding) and (2) community members’ critical assessments of their own relevant knowledge. I reflect on the impact of the symposium on subsequent collaborative efforts, and I contemplate institutional obstacles that remain for scholars attempting to decolonize archaeological research in Mexico. Finally, I consider how the symposium format could be implemented in other research contexts.\n, \nÚltimamente, los académicos han argumentado de una manera convincente sobre la necesidad de investigaciones arqueológicas “con, para, y por” las comunidades descendientes con justificaciones éticas y epistémicas.

Además de describir el método del simposio, relato como mitigué dos retos grandes en su implementación: (1) incentivo o compensación (y por lo tanto, patrocinio) y (2) las evaluaciones negativas de los miembros de la comunidad de su propio conocimiento relevante. Reflexiono sobre el impacto del simposio en el éxito de esfuerzos colaborativos posteriores y contemplo los obstáculos institucionales que quedan para los académicos que quieren decolonizar las investigaciones arqueológicas en México.

  {"id":"overholtzer2021","abstract":"This article quantifies the rate at which women archaeologists are present and retained in university departments. Drawing on publicly available data, we examine gender representation in (1) doctorates earned between 2002–2003 and 2016–2017; (2) Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) grant applications and awards at the doctoral to senior levels between 2003 and 2017; (3) tenure-stream faculty at Canadian universities in 2019; and (4) placement of Canadian PhDs in the United States. These data demonstrate that women today represent two-thirds of all Canadian doctorates in archaeology, but only one-third of Canadian tenure-stream faculty, although not all archaeologists choose an academic career. In the last 15 years, women with Canadian PhDs have been hired into tenure-track positions in Canada at rates statistically lower than men, but at higher rates in the United States. Women apply for SSHRC archaeology grants in equal proportion to their presence, but men are awarded at a slightly higher rate. We end by discussing the possible reasons for this gendered attrition, including a “chilly climate”—that is, subtle practices that stereotype, exclude, and devalue women, as well as inhospitable working environments, particularly for primary caregivers. We warn that the current COVID-19 pandemic is likely to exacerbate these existing inequalities.\n, \nCet article quantifie l'incapacité de l'archéologie universitaire à retenir les femmes au Canada. Il s'appuie sur des données publiques concernant : (1) les doctorats en archéologie obtenus entre 2002–2003 et 2016–2017 ; (2) les demandes de subventions en archéologie du Conseil de recherches en sciences humaines (SSHRC) et de bourses accordées aux niveaux de la recherche doctorale, postdoctorale et supérieure entre 2003 et 2017 ; (3) des professeurs d'archéologie (adjointe, associé et titulaire) dans les universités canadiennes en 2019 ; et (4) le placement des titulaires d'un doctorat canadien aux États-Unis. Ces données démontrent que les femmes reçoivent aujourd'hui les deux tiers des doctorats en archéologie, mais représentent seulement un tiers des professeurs. Au cours des quinze dernières années, les femmes titulaires d'un doctorat canadien ont été embauchées à des postes permanents au Canada à des taux statistiquement inférieurs à ceux de leurs homologues masculins, ce qui laisse entrevoir la possibilité d'un biais systématique lors de l'embauche. Les femmes sollicitent des subventions du SSHRC en proportion égale par rapport à leur présence à chaque niveau ; cependant, à chaque niveau les projets dirigés par des hommes ont eu légèrement plus de succès que ceux des femmes. L'article se termine par une discussion sur les raisons possibles de l'attrition de femmes de la discipline, y compris un “climat froid” pour les femmes, faisant référence à des pratiques subtiles et non discursives qui stéréotypent, excluent et dévalorisent les femmes, et à un environnement de travail inhospitalier pour les familles et disproportionnément pour les mères universitaires.

The analysis of scientific data is contingent upon the successful collection or production and then processing of data. This qualitative research study, of four data-intensive research groups, investigates scientists engaging in data processing work practices to describe and analyze three distinctive but intertwined practices: cleaning data products, selecting a subset of a data product or assembling a new data product from multiple sources, and transforming data products into a common format. These practices are necessary for researchers to transform an initial data product in to one that is ready for scientific analysis.

Research libraries are responding to the rapid rise in interdisciplinary scholarship and the advances in digital content, technologies, and infrastructure that accompany an emerging data-intensive research paradigm. This chapter considers two key areas in LIS that inform current practice in research libraries—bibliometrics and information practices research. Bibliometric approaches investigate the patterns and flows of information among disciplines, and information practices research examines the activities and materials involved in the conduct of interdisciplinary work. As technical advances continue to solve problems in navigation and retrieval of information across disciplinary boundaries, the greatest challenge will be to assure the meaning and validity of newly created interdisciplinary knowledge through information systems that can sustain the increasingly long and mutable information paths back to our disciplinary intellectual foundations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Palmer","given":"Carole L."},{"family":"Fenlon","given":"Katrina"}],"citation-key":"palmer2017","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198733522.013.35","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,26]]},"source":"www.oxfordhandbooks.com","title":"Information Research on Interdisciplinarity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198733522.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780198733522-e-35"},
  {"id":"palsson2021","abstract":"Network methods have seen a rapid rise in archaeology in recent years. There are still concerns regarding how well formal networks are able to effectively model local interaction. These are often present in the so-called qualitative network approaches—studies that tend to be based on close readings of relations between entities and the way they form dynamic networks of agents. Such studies have demonstrated the value in scrutinizing the way in which relations might be acted on in practice, and how that might differ from expected results. But rarely do such studies produce network data of the kind analyzed by formal network analytical methods. Formal approaches, on the other hand, blur the specificity of individual relations and trade much of their specificity for the ability to make general statements about relations across large datasets. More generally, the modality of the relation/edge is a crucial way in which formal network analysis differs from other prevalent relational approaches popular in archaeology today, where the substantivity of individual relations is paramount. Such relations are often seen as starting points for subsequent hybridizations that radically alter, if only temporarily, the structure of their respective networks. I argue that a key step in allowing networks to reformulate from initial, data-driven network schemata is the introduction of a more symmetrical agency between the node and the edge. In this article, I discuss how ethnographic sources can be used to achieve this for archaeological survey data. I use assemblage theory as a framework to explore the potential the edge has to offer archaeological network modelling. While assemblage theory is helpful for this purpose, the lack of a computational formality to assemblage theory immediately places it at odds with network science. As a complement, I will also employ the computational ontology CIDOC-CRM to more explicitly articulate the character of links between nodes in archaeological networks. The paper will end by suggesting a method of network modelling which integrates the line as a key source of agency. As a nod to Ingold’s call for an increased emphasis on the line, I call this approach network linaeology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Pálsson","given":"Gísli"}],"citation-key":"palsson2021","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-020-09450-1","ISSN":"1573-7764","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"178-196","source":"Springer Link","title":"Cutting the Network, Knotting the Line: a Linaeological Approach to Network Analysis","title-short":"Cutting the Network, Knotting the Line","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-020-09450-1","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"palumbo2013","abstract":"In the last half of the century, advances in the systemic therapy of cancer, including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy have been responsible for improvements in cancer related mortality in developed countries even as the population continues to age. Although such advancements have yet to benefit all cancer types, systemic therapies have led to an improvement in overall survival in both the adjuvant and metastatic setting for many cancers. With the pressure to make therapies available as soon as possible, the side-effects of systemic therapies, in particular long-term side-effects are not very well characterized and understood. Increasingly, a number of cancer types are requiring long-term and even lifelong systemic therapy. This is true for both younger and older patients with cancer and has important implications for each subset. Younger patients have an overall greater expected life-span, and as a result may suffer a greater variety of treatment related complications in the long-term, whereas older patients may develop earlier side-effects as a result of their frailty. Because the incidence of cancer in the world will increase over the next several decades and there will be more people living with cancer, it is important to have an understanding of the potential side-effects of new systemic therapies. As an introductory article, in this review series, we begin by describing some of the major advances made in systemic cancer therapy along with some of their known side-effects and we also make an attempt to describe the future of systemic cancer therapy.","author":[{"family":"Palumbo","given":"Michael O."},{"family":"Kavan","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Wilson H."},{"family":"Panasci","given":"Lawrence"},{"family":"Assouline","given":"Sarit"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Nathalie"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Patenaude","given":"Francois"},{"family":"Pollak","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Jagoe","given":"R.

  {"id":"panich2019","abstract":"To understand the implications of archaeological site recording practices and associated inventories for studying Indigenous persistence after the arrival of Europeans, we examined the documentary record associated with nearly 900 archaeological sites in Marin County, California. Beginning with the first regional surveys conducted during the early 1900s and continuing into the present, the paper trail created by archaeologists reveals an enduring emphasis on precontact materials to the exclusion of more recent patterns of Indigenous occupation and land use. In assessing sites occupied by Indigenous people from the late sixteenth through the mid-twentieth centuries, we discuss how the use of multiple lines of evidence—including temporally diagnostic artifacts, chronometric dating techniques, and historical documentation—may help illuminate subtle but widespread patterns of Native presence that have been obscured by essentialist assumptions about Indigenous culture change. Our findings further reveal the shortcomings of traditional site recording systems, in which archaeologists typically categorize sites within the prehistoric-protohistoric-historic triad on the basis of commonsense decisions that conflate chronology with identity. Instead, we argue for recording practices that focus specifically on the calendric ages of occupation for any given site., Para entender las implicaciones de las prácticas de registro e inventariación de sitios arqueológicos asociados con la persistencia indígena después de la llegada de los europeos, examinamos el registro documental asociado con casi 900 sitios arqueológicos en el condado de Marin, California. Comenzando con las primeras encuestas regionales realizadas a principios del siglo veinte y continuando hasta el presente, el registro creado por los arqueólogos revela un énfasis constante en los materiales precontacto y la exclusión de patrones de uso y residencia más recientes. Al evaluar los sitios ocupados por grupos indígenas desde finales del siglo dieciséis hasta mediados del siglo veinte, analizamos la manera en que el uso de múltiples líneas de evidencia (incluidos los artefactos diagnósticos, técnicas de datación cronométrica, y documentación histórica) puede contribuir a iluminar patrones sutiles pero generalizados de presencia que han sido ocultados por premisas esencialistas sobre el cambio cultural indígena. Nuestros hallazgos resaltan las deficiencias de los sistemas tradicionales de registro en los que los arqueólogos clasifican los sitios como prehistóricos, protohistóricos o históricos con base en decisiones de sentido común que mezclan la cronología con la identidad. En su lugar, abogamos por prácticas de registro centradas específicamente en las fechas calendáricas de ocupación de los sitios.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Panich","given":"Lee M."},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Tsim D."}],"citation-key":"panich2019","container-title":"American Antiquity","DOI":"10.1017/aaq.2019.54","ISSN":"0002-7316, 2325-5064","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10]]},"language":"en","page":"651-668","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Categorical Denial: Evaluating Post-1492 Indigenous Erasure in the Paper Trail of American Archaeology","title-short":"Categorical Denial","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/categorical-denial-evaluating-post1492-indigenous-erasure-in-the-paper-trail-of-american-archaeology/BCC0C15D7DF42D1149181D579DF6FAD4","volume":"84"},

Mixture maximum-likelihood worked well using low-dimensional lead isotope data, but had problems coping with higher-dimensional ceramic compositional data. For our most challenging example, classification maximum-likelihood performed comparably with more standard methods, but we find no evidence to suggest that it should supplant these.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Papageorgiou","given":"Ioulia"},{"family":"Baxter","given":"M.

But how does the rise of these “programmer-journalists,” armed with their skills and technical artifacts, really affect the way journalism can contribute to the public good? Based on an empirical study in Chicago, we show in this article that although they have built on previous historical developments, these programmer-journalists have also partly challenged the epistemology conveyed by the computer-assisted reporting tradition in the US, grounded in the assumption that data can help journalists to set the political agenda through the disclosure of public issues. Involved in open source communities and open government advocacy, these programmers and their technical artifacts have conveyed challenging epistemological propositions that have been highly controversial in the journalism community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Parasie","given":"Sylvain"},{"family":"Dagiral","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"parasie2013","container-title":"New Media & Society","container-title-short":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444812463345","ISSN":"1461-4448","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"853-871","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Data-driven journalism and the public good: “Computer-assisted-reporters” and “programmer-journalists” in Chicago","title-short":"Data-driven journalism and the public good","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444812463345","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"parasie2015","abstract":"As an increasing number of reporters see databases and algorithms as appropriate means of doing investigation, journalism has been challenged in recent years by the following question: to what extent would the processing of huge datasets allow journalists to produce new types of revelations that rely less on normative assumptions? Drawing on the analysis of a particular investigation by the San Francisco-based Center for Investigative Reporting, this article points out the existence of epistemological tensions in the making of journalistic revelations that involve the processing of vast amounts of data. First, I show that the design of data-processing artifacts can match the traditional epistemology of journalistic investigation, but only with great efforts and resources from the organization. Second, I point out that the use of these artifacts by journalists follows two opposite paths to produce the revelation: a “hypothesis-driven” path and a “data-driven” path. Such findings contribute to a better understanding of how news organizations produce justified beliefs, as data-processing artifacts become major components of the newsroom’s environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Parasie","given":"Sylvain"}],"citation-key":"parasie2015","container-title":"Digital Journalism","DOI":"10.1080/21670811.2014.976408","ISSN":"2167-0811","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",5,4]]},"page":"364-380","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Data-Driven Revelation?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2014.976408","volume":"3"},

Digital design objects, the museum’s new type of collection, are seen as a driving force for change in collections documentation practices. This paper argues for models of documentation to change from closed to open and participatory in order to (re)present such objects’ materiality in collection records through the voices of multiple actors.

  {"id":"pauketat2001","abstract":"A new paradigm is emerging in archaeology herein dubbed ‘historical processualism’. A review of three contemporary approaches to the study of the past – neo-Darwinism, cognitive-processualism, and agency theory – suggests that the standard notions of ‘behavior’ and ‘evolution’ are being replaced in archaeological explanations by ‘practice’ and ‘history’. Behavioral analogies, commonly used to construct inferences about ‘why’ cultures changed, are problematic. In their place, archaeologists should substitute the study of cultural practices – what people did and how they negotiated their views of others and of their own pasts – as these were and are the actual processes of cultural change. The emphasis on practice entails the elevation of historical explanations, in the process altering the questions that archaeologists ask and the data that they must gather to address those questions. The importance of this paradigmatic shift is exemplified by contrasting contemporary explanations of Mississippian pottery and political change in the pre-Columbian American midcontinent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Pauketat","given":"Timothy R."}],"citation-key":"pauketat2001","container-title":"Anthropological Theory","container-title-short":"Anthropological Theory","DOI":"10.1177/146349960100100105","ISSN":"1463-4996","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"73-98","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Practice and history in archaeology: An emerging paradigm","title-short":"Practice and history in archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/146349960100100105","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"paynter2017","abstract":"Amber natron glasses were produced from at least the Hellenistic period and continued to be produced into the early second century CE. However, as with other strong colours used for Roman vessel production, this colour gradually declined in popularity as colourless and blue-green glass came to dominate. Whilst the colouring mechanisms for blue-green glasses are relatively well understood, the cause of the distinctive amber colour is more complex and can be attributed to the iron sulphur chromophore. This paper demonstrates, using analytical data and model glasses, that the amber colour develops during primary production, and that the sulphate-rich natron is key. The analytical data show that most natron amber glass was probably produced in the Levant alongside the more common blue-green glasses, however, its composition is different. Whilst many glass colours were made in a secondary stage, by adding colourants and opacifiers to a blue-green or colourless glass base, amber glass was not made this way since it required a slightly different set of raw materials and melting technologies. These findings suggest that the production of the glass required specialist knowledge, and particularly skilled furnace operation, in order to produce repeatable results. Skilled specialists would also be required to work amber glass whilst retaining the same clear amber hue, especially for complex wares, such as mosaic vessels, where the glass would be reheated more than once.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Paynter","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Caroline M."}],"citation-key":"paynter2017","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2017.11.038","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,12]]},"source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Mellow yellow: An experiment in amber","title-short":"Mellow yellow","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X17305084"},

Network models drawing on approaches from graph theory, social network analysis, and complexity science have been used to address a broad array of questions about the relationships among network structure, positions, and the attributes and outcomes for individuals and larger groups at a range of social scales. Current archaeological network research is both methodologically and theoretically diverse, but there are still many daunting challenges ahead for the formal exploration of social networks using archaeological data. If we can face these challenges, archaeologists are well positioned to contribute to long-standing debates in the broader sphere of network research on the nature of network theory, the relationships between networks and culture, and dynamics of social networks over the long term.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Peeples","given":"Matthew A."}],"citation-key":"peeples2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Research","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Res","DOI":"10.1007/s10814-019-09127-8","ISSN":"1573-7756","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,4]]},"language":"en","source":"Springer Link","title":"Finding a Place for Networks in Archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10814-019-09127-8"},
  {"id":"peixotto2021","abstract":"Field research requires careful preparation so as to protect the integrity of archaeological studies and ensure the health and wellness of our students and field crews. In this special issue, we hope to lay a foundation for securing health and wellness as elements of the ethical practice of archaeology fieldwork through discussions of common hazards and tools to prevent, prepare for, and address safety incidents in the field. Even as archaeology and other field sciences grapple with serious safety concerns such as sexual harassment and mental health, it can be tempting to view field sites as extensions of the classroom or office. But field research can be a high-risk endeavor where we are exposed to a range of hazards not typically encountered in a traditional learning or work environment. We reach across disciplinary boundaries toward outdoor leadership and backcountry medicine to introduce the concept of wilderness context to describe the remote—and not-so-remote—locations and conditions common to archaeology field research. These are places where small or unanticipated problems can quickly become serious incidents. By rethinking research sites as wilderness activity sites, we highlight how methodical preparation can help us craft more robust and ethical health and safety practices for all members of our teams.\n, \nLa investigación de campo requiere de una cuidadosa preparación para proteger la integridad de nuestros estudios y asegurar la salud y el bienestar de nuestros estudiantes y equipos de campo. En esta edición especial, esperamos sentar las bases para garantizar la salud y el bienestar en el trabajo de campo arqueológico, a través de discusiones sobre peligros comunes y herramientas para prevenir, preparar y abordar incidentes de seguridad en el campo. Aún cuando la arqueología y otras ciencias de campo luchan contra serios problemas de seguridad, como el acoso sexual y la salud mental, el entender los lugares de campo como extensión del aula o la oficina puede resultar tentador. Sin embargo, la investigación de campo suele ser una empresa arriesgada, ya que estamos expuestos a una variedad de peligros que normalmente no encontramos entre las cuatro paredes de un entorno de aprendizaje o trabajo tradicionales. Aquí, atravesamos los límites interdisciplinarios para llegar al liderazgo al aire libre, la medicina rural y presentar el concepto del contexto silvestre para describir las ubicaciones y condiciones remotas y no tan remotas, tan comunes en la investigación de campo arqueológica, donde los problemas pequeños o imprevistos pueden convertirse súbitamente en incidentes graves. Al repensar los lugares de investigación como sitios destinados a actividades en la naturaleza, resaltamos cómo la preparación metódica puede ayudarnos a trabajar hacia prácticas de salud y seguridad más sólidas y éticas para todos los integrantes de nuestros equipos.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Peixotto","given":"Becca"},{"family":"Klehm","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Eifling","given":"Kurt P."}],"citation-key":"peixotto2021","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2020.50","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2]]},"language":"en","page":"1-9","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Rethinking Research Sites as Wilderness Activity Sites: Reframing Health, Safety, and Wellness in Archaeology","title-short":"Rethinking Research Sites as Wilderness Activity Sites","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/abs/rethinking-research-sites-as-wilderness-activity-sites/3298E68FB7335D01CCAE66E9C065A9B0","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"pellegram1998","abstract":"The field of material culture, while historically well established, has recently enjoyed something of a renaissance. Methods once dominated by Marxist- and commodity-oriented analyses and by the study of objects as symbols are giving way to a more ethnographic approach to artifacts. This orientation is the cornerstone of the essays presented in Material Cultures. A collection of case studies which move from the domestic sphere to the global arena, the volume includes examinations of the soundscape produced by home radios, catalog shopping, the role of paper in the workplace, and the relationship between the production and consumption of Coca-Cola in Trinidad.  The diversity of the essays is mediated by their common commitment to ethnography with a material focus. Rather than examine objects as mirages of media or language, Material Cultures emphasizes how the study of objects not only contributes to an understanding of artifacts but is also an effective means for studying social values and contradictions.","author":[{"family":"Pellegram","given":"Andrea"}],"citation-key":"pellegram1998","container-title":"Material Cultures: Why Some Things Matter","editor":[{"family":"Miller","given":"Daniel"}],"ISBN":"978-0-226-52601-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",2,17]]},"language":"en","page":"103-120","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The message in paper","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"penders2022","abstract":"The reform movement in science is seemingly constructing a new moral economy of science around process and bureaucracy, in which a new scientific etiquette is emerging that prescribes the performance of reformed science as civilised, efficient and objective. Bureaucratic innovations were borne out of the reform movement that seek to prescribe specific research processes, including but not limited to preregistration and registered reports. This moral economy emerges in the form of a bureaucracy and its epistemic uniformity actively suppresses scientific plurality. This paper argues that Eliasian drivers such as distinction, shame and disgust, act to pressure scientists into adopting this new etiquette.

  {"id":"pepe2009","abstract":"In the process of scientific research, many artifacts are generated. Until recently, only the final product - the publication - was deemed worthy of curation for future use. Now, the full range of products generated during the research life cycle may remain valuable indefinitely. However, individual artifacts such as instrument data and associated calibration information may have little value alone; their meaning is derived from their relationships to each other. Individual artifacts thus are best described and represented as components of value chains, which may be specific to the life cycle of a given research project. Current cataloging practices do not describe objects at a sufficient level of granularity nor do they offer the globally persistent identifiers necessary to discover and manage scholarly products with World Wide Web standards. The Open Archives Initiative - Object Reuse and Exchange protocol (OAI-ORE) meets these requirements. We demonstrate, through the use of case studies in seismology and environmental engineering, how OAI-ORE can be used to express value chains within a life cycle of scientific research. By establishing the relationships between publications, data, and contextual research information, we can obtain a richer and more realistic view of scholarly practices. That view can be used to facilitate new forms of scientific research and learning. Our analysis is framed by studies of scientific practic es in a large, multi-disciplinary, multi-university science and engineering research center, the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing (CENS).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Pepe","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Borgman","given":"Christine L."},{"family":"Van de Sompel","given":"Herbert"},{"family":"Mayernik","given":"Matthew"}],"citation-key":"pepe2009","container-title":"CERN Document Server","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",6,16]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:0906.2549","title":"Technology to Represent Scientific Practice: Data, Life Cycles, and Value Chains","title-short":"Technology to Represent Scientific Practice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://cds.cern.ch/record/1183988"},

However, damage caused by flooding of interior areas and waterways has received less consideration. In this article, we present a case study of a collaborative emergency response to a significant weather event and the ensuing impacts on archaeological resources. Our project, located in Middle Tennessee, documented severe erosion and subsequent anthropogenic disturbances to ancient Native American sites following massive flooding of the Cumberland River in 2010. While striving to mitigate this damage via systematic collection of imperiled archaeological samples, we were also able to strengthen partnerships among professional archaeologists working in different arenas (academia, state and federal agencies) and the avocational archaeological community. As these types of weather-related events become more common, published case studies of response efforts will be crucial in archaeological site management, planning, and disaster response., En tiempos recientes, el efecto del cambio climático y desastres naturales en el registro arqueología y patrimonio ha ganado mucha atención, especialmente el aumento del nivel del mar y la inundación del litoral.

Prior to engaging with emerging tools, this paper takes one step back to probe the subtexts of traditional two-dimensional archaeological images. Of interest is whether the many implications of these images can be made poignant via personally manipulating and imposing upon their form and function. Influenced by the work of various playwrights, artists, anthropologists, cultural theorists, and archaeologists, this paper examines what is legitimate in our practices of picturing the past, and what it means to explicitly—perhaps illicitly—interfere with typical archaeological visuals. Via tentative experiments with assorted maps, photos and illustrations, I endeavour to turn these orthodox modes of engagement into more defiant tools of discovery and critique. Ultimately, my objective is to disrupt convention and prompt archaeologists to confront and respond to themselves (and their responsibilities to others) in their everyday interactions with media.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Perry","given":"Sara"}],"citation-key":"perry2009","container-title":"Archaeologies","container-title-short":"Arch","DOI":"10.1007/s11759-009-9114-z","ISSN":"1935-3987","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"389-415","source":"Springer Link","title":"Fractured Media: Challenging the Dimensions of Archaeology’s Typical Visual Modes of Engagement","title-short":"Fractured Media","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11759-009-9114-z","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"perry2015","abstract":"While blogging in archaeology has a genealogy that can be traced back nearly two decades, the relationship between such practice and the constitution of disciplinary expertise has barely been probed. Arguably directly relatable to early web-based efforts to reconfigure the archaeological interpretative process and redefine professional identity (e.g. as evidenced in Cornelius Holtorf's 1998 hypermediated PhD dissertation), blog work has long been drawn into the exercise of crafting skilled bodies and accredited knowledge bases. In the last 10 years, however, it has increasingly been applied to the academic classroom, where it is used as a formal teaching tool at all levels of university education. The implications of this pedagogical phenomenon are profound, yet the epistemological consequences for the professionalisation of archaeology are hardly understood. Here I combine a critical analysis of students' experiments with blogging in my own undergraduate archaeology courses with an overview of comparable classroom-based and professional weblog work elsewhere. I draw upon evidence collected through survey, interviews, course assessments and reflective reports to make a case not only for blogging as a meaningful creative exercise, but as a mechanism by which the very nature of archaeology itself can be prodded, extended and perhaps even fundamentally reconfigured. Although often fraught with tension, blog work is an influential intellectual tool for the discipline. I outline here how it promises both to narrow the gap between archaeological theory and practice, and simultaneously to hone and empower emerging professionals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Perry","given":"Sara"}],"citation-key":"perry2015","container-title":"Internet Archaeology","DOI":"10.11141/ia.39.9","ISSN":"13635387","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",5]]},"title":"Changing the way Archaeologists Work: Blogging and the development of expertise","title-short":"Changing the way Archaeologists Work","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue39/9/","volume":"39"},
  {"id":"perry2015a","abstract":"From blogs to crowdfunding, YouTube to LinkedIn, online photo-sharing sites to open-source community-based software projects, the social web has been a meaningful player in the development of archaeological practice for two decades now. Yet despite its myriad applications, it is still often appreciated as little more than a tool for communication, rather than a paradigm-shifting system that also shapes the questions we ask in our research, the nature and spread of our data, and the state of skill and expertise in the profession. We see this failure to critically engage with its dimensions as one of the most profound challenges confronting archaeology today. The social web is bound up in relations of power, control, freedom, labour and exploitation, with consequences that portend real instability for the cultural sector and for social welfare overall. Only a handful of archaeologists, however, are seriously debating these matters, which suggests the discipline is setting itself up to be swept away by our unreflective investment in the cognitive capitalist enterprise that marks much current web-based work. Here we review the state of play of the archaeological social web, and reflect on various conscientious activities aimed both at challenging practitioners’ current online interactions, and at otherwise situating the discipline as a more informed innovator with the social web’s possibilities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Perry","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Beale","given":"Nicole"}],"citation-key":"perry2015a","container-title":"Open Archaeology","DOI":"10.1515/opar-2015-0009","ISSN":"2300-6560","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"source":"DeGruyter","title":"The Social Web and Archaeology’s Restructuring: Impact, Exploitation, Disciplinary Change","title-short":"The Social Web and Archaeology’s Restructuring","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/opar.2014.1.issue-1/opar-2015-0009/opar-2015-0009.xml","volume":"1"},
  {"id":"perry2015b","abstract":"Decades of Internet study have arguably done little to shed light on the nature and implications of web-based communications in archaeology. Since the late 1990s, the online world has been lauded by archaeologists for its capacities to engender dialogue, participation, intellectual change and even democratic revolution. Yet the dangers associated with its use have barely been probed. Threats to privacy, equality, access, security of data, and personal safety and well-being are seemingly characteristic of all communication technologies. However, the naive zeal with which many archaeological and heritage organisations are employing online platforms for dissemination, profile-building, 'impact' and public accountability is fraught with risk and deserving of interrogation.\n\nThis article explores the effects of digital culture on the professional identities and careers of archaeologists, heritage specialists and museum workers. Through a multi-disciplinary survey of over 400 individuals, nearly one-third of whom self-identified as archaeological or related heritage practitioners (working both inside and outside of the academic sector), we consider the various ways in which online technologies are used to express, promote, facilitate, strengthen and undermine both professionals themselves and professional practices in archaeology. Situating ourselves in the intersectional and feminist literature, we argue that web-based harassment and lack of adequate e-safety mechanisms are rife in the discipline, putting it in jeopardy of fuelling structural inequalities. Our findings suggest that close to one-third of practitioners report victimisation via online communication; the majority know their abusers offline; and, although the prevalence of such abuse is roughly equal among men and women, its nature is split along gender lines. Of especial concern, most practitioners choose to ignore their abuse, a decision that may be motivated by the non-existent or victim-harming institutional e-policies rampant in the sector. We call, then, for archaeology and heritage organisations - and their funders - to recognise their incontrovertible duty of care to staff, volunteers, students and communities engaged with their online platforms. As chronicled here, the meaningful public impact, access and empowerment sought by the profession via the social web are not achievable without investment in robust protection and prevention measures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Perry","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Shipley","given":"Lucy"},{"family":"Osborne","given":"Jim"}],"citation-key":"perry2015b","container-title":"Internet Archaeology","container-title-short":"IA","DOI":"10.11141/ia.38.4","ISSN":"1363-5387","issue":"38","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,22]]},"language":"en","source":"intarch.ac.uk","title":"Digital Media, Power and (In)Equality in Archaeology and Heritage","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue38/perry_index.html"},

  {"id":"perry2017","abstract":"There is a growing use of bottom-up simulation models to reconstruct past human-environment interactions. Such detailed representations pose difficult questions not only in their design (the generality-realism trade-off) but also about the inferences that are made from them. The historical sciences are faced with seeking to make robust inferences from limited, potentially biased and/or incomplete samples from uncontrolled systems, and as a result have sometimes employed narrative explanation. By contrast, simulation models can be used experimentally and can generate large amounts of data. Here, using an agent-based model of hunter-gatherer foraging in a previously unexplored ecosystem, we consider how narratives might be identified from the trajectories produced by simulations. We show how machine learning methods can isolate qualitatively similar types of model behaviour based on summaries of model outcomes and time series. We stand to learn from this approach because it enables us to answer two questions: (i) under what conditions (representations and/or parameterisations) do we observe in the model what is recorded in the archaeological and/or palaeoenvironmental record? and (ii) does the model yield unobserved dynamics? If so, are they plausible? Using models to develop narratives is a logical extension of the bottom-up approach inherent in agent-based modelling and has the potential, alongside conventional methods of model evaluation, to aid in learning from the rich dynamics of such simulations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Perry","given":"George L.

  {"id":"perry2018","abstract":"“Heritage interpretation” is generally conceived as the development and presentation of knowledge about the past for public audiences. Most obviously evidenced in descriptive signs, guides, and related media installed on archaeological and cultural sites, heritage interpretation has more than a half century of theory and applied practice behind it, yet it continues to sit uncomfortably within the typical archaeological workflow. While the concept can be criticized on many fronts, of concern is the lack of recognition that it is of equal relevance to both nonexpert and expert audiences (as opposed to nonexpert audiences alone). Our profession appears to rest on an assumption that archaeologists do their own kind of interpretation—and, separately, nonexperts require a special approach that heritage interpreters must facilitate but that field specialists have no need for—or from which little obvious expert benefit can be derived. For this reason, it is rare to find heritage interpreters embedded in primary fieldwork teams. Here I call for a rethinking of the traditional workflow, with a view to integrating the heritage interpretation tool kit and heritage interpreters themselves into our basic field methodologies. Their direct involvement in disciplinary process from the outset has the potential to transform archaeological interpretation overall., La interpretación del patrimonio cultural generalmente se considera como el desarrollo y la presentación de conocimientos sobre el pasado para el público en general. Su mayor evidencia son los letreros descriptivos, guías y medios relacionados instalados en sitios arqueológicos y culturales. La interpretación del patrimonio cultural tiene más de medio siglo de teoría y práctica aplicada detrás de ella; sin embargo, permanece en una posición incómoda dentro del típico proceso de trabajo arqueológico. Si bien el concepto puede ser criticado desde muchos frentes, es preocupante la falta de reconocimiento que la interpretación del patrimonio cultural tiene la misma relevancia para el público de expertos que para el de no expertos. Nuestra profesión parece basarse en la suposición que los arqueólogos hacen su propio tipo de interpretación y que, por separado, los no expertos requieren un abordaje especial que los intérpretes del patrimonio cultural deben facilitar, pero que los especialistas de campo no necesitan, o que los beneficia de manera limitada. Por eso es raro encontrar intérpretes del patrimonio cultural integrados en equipos de campo primarios. Aquí se propone reconsiderar el flujo de trabajo arqueológico tradicional, con la intención de integrar los instrumentos de la interpretación del patrimonio cultural y los intérpretes mismos en nuestras metodologías de campo básicas. Su participación directa desde el comienzo del proceso de trabajo tiene el potencial de transformar la interpretación arqueológica en general.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Perry","given":"Sara"}],"citation-key":"perry2018","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2018.21","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8]]},"language":"en","page":"212-227","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Why Are Heritage Interpreters Voiceless at the Trowel's Edge?

  {"id":"perry2019","abstract":"Empirical studies increasingly testify to the capacity for archaeological and cultural heritage sites to engender wonder, transformation, attachment, and community bonding amongst diverse individuals. Following political theorist Jane Bennett, these sites have the power to ‘enchant’ and, in so doing, they are seedbeds of human generosity, ethical mindfulness, and care for the world at large. However, the means by which such enchantment is created, and the extent to which these intimate encounters with the prehistoric or historic record can be deliberately crafted, are little understood. Worsening the predicament, professional practices commonly thwart the potential for archaeology to provoke ethical action amongst humans. Here, I propose a multi-stranded conceptual model for generating enchantment with the archaeological record across both professional audiences and broader publics. With reference to the European Commission-funded EMOTIVE Project, I articulate one particular strand of this model: facilitated dialogue. Alongside exploring the role of digital culture in its advancement, I argue that an enchantment-led approach is imperative for achieving a truly socially-beneficial archaeological discipline., Les études empiriques révèlent de plus en plus que les sites archéologiques et ceux appartenant au patrimoine culturel sont capables d'engendrer un sens de l’émerveillement, de transformation, d'attachement et de créer des liens entre des communautés comprenant des individus les plus divers. Selon les théories politiques de Jane Bennett, ces sites ont le pouvoir « d'enchanter » et, ce faisant, permettent de promouvoir la générosité, une prise de conscience éthique et un égard accru envers le monde en général. Mais on comprend encore mal comment ce sens de l'enchantement est créé et combien ces rencontres intimes avec le passé préhistorique ou historique peuvent être délibérément réalisées. Les difficultés sont accrues du fait que les professionnels de l'archéologie obstruent souvent le potentiel de l'archéologie en termes d'action éthique. Dans cet article, je propose un modèle comprenant plusieurs éléments conceptuels permettant de produire un sens de l'enchantement par rapport aux témoignages de l'archéologie et destiné autant à une audience de professionnels qu’à un public plus large. Dans le cadre du projet EMOTIVE financé par la Commission européenne, je présente une facette de ce modèle : le dialogue facilité. En dehors d'un examen du rôle de la culture numérique et de son évolution, je soutiens qu'une approche centrée sur l'enchantement est essentielle en archéologie, si l'on veut que cette discipline soit vraiment bénéfique sur le plan social.

In this article, we appraise the brain sex differences literature through the lens of open science, a movement aimed at improving the robustness and reliability of science. In this discussion, we offer a feminist evaluation of the strategies (e.g., pre-registration, data sharing, and accountability) provided by open science, and we question whether these may be the novel and disruptive tools needed to dismantle claims about hardwired brain sex differences. We suggest that open science strategies can be useful in challenging some of these claims, and we note that promising initiatives are already being developed in neuroscience and allied fields. We end by acknowledging the distinct challenges that feminist researchers wishing to engage in open science face, particularly in the context of limited diversity. We conclude that open science presents considerable opportunity for feminist researchers, and that it will be crucial for feminists to be involved in shaping the future of this movement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Persson","given":"Sofia"},{"family":"Pownall","given":"Madeleine"}],"citation-key":"persson2021","container-title":"Psychology of Women Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/03616843211037613","ISSN":"0361-6843","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"493-504","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Can Open Science be a Tool to Dismantle Claims of Hardwired Brain Sex Differences?

The SO is based on empirical research and earlier models and is designed so as to incorporate related works through a modular structure. The SO is an elaboration of the domain-independent core part of the NeDiMAH Methods Ontology addressing the scholarly ecosystem of Digital Humanities. It thus provides a basis for developing domain-specific scholarly work ontologies springing from a common root. We define the basic concepts of the model and their semantic relations through four complementary perspectives on scholarly work: activity, procedure, resource and agency. As a use case we present a modelling example and argue on the purpose of use of the model through the presentation of indicative SPRQL and SQWRL queries that highlight the benefits of its serialization in RDFS. The SO includes an explicit treatment of intentionality and its interplay with functionality, captured by different parts of the model.

  {"id":"peters2015","abstract":"When we speak of clouds these days, it is as likely that we mean data clouds or network clouds as cumulus or stratus. In their sharing of the term, both kinds of clouds reveal an essential truth: that the natural world and the technological world are not so distinct. In The Marvelous Clouds, John Durham Peters argues that though we often think of media as environments, the reverse is just as true—environments are media. Peters defines media expansively as elements that compose the human world. Drawing from ideas implicit in media philosophy, Peters argues that media are more than carriers of messages: they are the very infrastructures combining nature and culture that allow human life to thrive.  Through an encyclopedic array of examples from the oceans to the skies, The Marvelous Clouds reveals the long prehistory of so-called new media. Digital media, Peters argues, are an extension of early practices tied to the establishment of civilization such as mastering fire, building calendars, reading the stars, creating language, and establishing religions. New media do not take us into uncharted waters, but rather confront us with the deepest and oldest questions of society and ecology: how to manage the relations people have with themselves, others, and the natural world. A wide-ranging meditation on the many means we have employed to cope with the struggles of existence—from navigation to farming, meteorology to Google—The Marvelous Clouds shows how media lie at the very heart of our interactions with the world around us.  Peters’s  book will not only change how we think about media but provide a new appreciation for the day-to-day foundations of life on earth that we so often take for granted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Peters","given":"John Durham"}],"citation-key":"peters2015","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"source":"www.press.uchicago.edu","title":"The Marvelous Clouds","type":"book","URL":"https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo20069392.html"},
  {"id":"peters2016","abstract":"How, despite thirty years of effort, Soviet attempts to build a national computer network were undone by socialists who seemed to behave like capitalists.Between 1959 and 1989, Soviet scientists and officials made numerous attempts to network their nation—to construct a nationwide computer network. None of these attempts succeeded, and the enterprise had been abandoned by the time the Soviet Union fell apart. Meanwhile, ARPANET, the American precursor to the Internet, went online in 1969. Why did the Soviet network, with top-level scientists and patriotic incentives, fail while the American network succeeded? In How Not to Network a Nation, Benjamin Peters reverses the usual cold war dualities and argues that the American ARPANET took shape thanks to well-managed state subsidies and collaborative research environments and the Soviet network projects stumbled because of unregulated competition among self-interested institutions, bureaucrats, and others. The capitalists behaved like socialists while the socialists behaved like capitalists. After examining the midcentury rise of cybernetics, the science of self-governing systems, and the emergence in the Soviet Union of economic cybernetics, Peters complicates this uneasy role reversal while chronicling the various Soviet attempts to build a “unified information network.” Drawing on previously unknown archival and historical materials, he focuses on the final, and most ambitious of these projects, the All-State Automated System of Management (OGAS), and its principal promoter, Viktor M. Glushkov. Peters describes the rise and fall of OGAS—its theoretical and practical reach, its vision of a national economy managed by network, the bureaucratic obstacles it encountered, and the institutional stalemate that killed it. Finally, he considers the implications of the Soviet experience for today's networked world.","author":[{"family":"Peters","given":"Benjamin"}],"citation-key":"peters2016","ISBN":"978-0-262-33418-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",6,3]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"313","publisher":"MIT Press","source":"Google Books","title":"How Not to Network a Nation: The Uneasy History of the Soviet Internet","title-short":"How Not to Network a Nation","type":"book"},

Drawing on our research studying the metascience movement, we suggest that the drive to maximize efficiency in science is increasingly extending beyond performance metrics, into labs themselves.

  {"id":"petrov2023","abstract":"How Bulgaria transformed the computer industry behind the Iron Curtain—and the consequences of that transformation for a society that dreamt of a brighter future.Bulgaria in 1963 was a communist country led by a centralized party trying to navigate a multinational Cold War. The state needed money, and it sought prestige. By cultivating a burgeoning computer industry, Bulgaria achieved both but at great cost to the established order. In Balkan Cyberia, Victor Petrov elevates a deeply researched, local story of ambition into an essential history of global innovation, ideological conflict, and exchange. Granted tremendous freedom by the Politburo and backed by a concerted state secret intelligence effort, a new, privileged class of technical intellectuals and managers rose to prominence in Bulgaria in the 1960s. Plugged in to transnational business and professional networks, they strove to realize the party’s radical dreams of utopian automation, and Bulgaria would come to manufacture up to half of the Eastern Bloc’s electronics. Yet, as Petrov shows, the export-oriented nature of the industry also led to the disruption of party rule. Technicians, now thinking with and through computers, began to recast the dominant intellectual discourse within a framework of reform, while technocratic managers translated their newfound political clout into economic power that served them well before and after the revolutions of 1989.Balkan Cyberia reveals the extension of economic and political networks of influence far past the reputed fall of communism, along with the pivotal role small countries played in geopolitical games at the time. Through the prism of the Bulgarian computer industry, the true nature of the socialist international economy, and indeed the links between capitalism and communism, emerge.","author":[{"family":"Petrov","given":"Victor"}],"citation-key":"petrov2023","ISBN":"978-0-262-54512-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,13]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"425","publisher":"MIT Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Balkan Cyberia: Cold War Computing, Bulgarian Modernization, and the Information Age behind the Iron Curtain","title-short":"Balkan Cyberia","type":"book"},

  {"id":"petterseno.2008","abstract":"Archaeological data collection is based on the description of archaeological contexts. An archaeological excavation demolishes the original matrix within which the cultural material is found and special care is taken to record spatial context. Each artifact is described in terms of its physical and spatial properties as well as its relation to the matrix (for example soil composition). As several thousands of artifacts can be unearthed during a field season, there is a need to develop digital resources and collections that focus on the publication and preservation of data and the creation of tools for the analysis of these data. The first section of this paper presents preliminary results and the lessons learnt on the development of a prototype for an Australian archaeological digital collection based on data grid middleware and infrastructure. The second section introduces a versatile 3D reconstruction tool that visualizes the excavated archaeological artifacts with its associated stratigraphy. The data come from two major archaeological projects in Queensland, Australia: the Mill Point Archaeological Project and the Cania Gorge Regional Archaeological Project. These case studies were selected to represent the different challenges in deploying these digital technologies to Australian archaeological applications.","author":[{"family":"Pettersen, O.","given":"Bordes","suffix":"N., Ulm, S., Gwynne, D., Simmich, T."},{"family":"Pailthorpe","given":"B."}],"citation-key":"petterseno.2008","container-title":"Grid computing and e-Research 2008 : proceedings of the sixth australasian workshop on grid computing and e-Research (AusGrid 2008), wollongong, NSW, australia, january 2008","editor":[{"family":"Kelly","given":"Wayne"}],"event-place":"Darlinghurst, Australia","ISBN":"978-1-920682-63-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"page":"17-25","publisher":"Australian Computer Society, published in association with the ACM Digital Library","publisher-place":"Darlinghurst, Australia","title":"Grid services for e-archaeology","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"pickering1995","abstract":"This ambitious book by one of the most original and provocative thinkers in science studies offers a sophisticated new understanding of the nature of scientific, mathematical, and engineering practice and the production of scientific knowledge.  Andrew Pickering offers a new approach to the unpredictable nature of change in science, taking into account the extraordinary number of factors—social, technological, conceptual, and natural—that interact to affect the creation of scientific knowledge. In his view, machines, instruments, facts, theories, conceptual and mathematical structures, disciplined practices, and human beings are in constantly shifting relationships with one another—\"mangled\" together in unforeseeable ways that are shaped by the contingencies of culture, time, and place.  Situating material as well as human agency in their larger cultural context, Pickering uses case studies to show how this picture of the open, changeable nature of science advances a richer understanding of scientific work both past and present. Pickering examines in detail the building of the bubble chamber in particle physics, the search for the quark, the construction of the quarternion system in mathematics, and the introduction of computer-controlled machine tools in industry. He uses these examples to address the most basic elements of scientific practice—the development of experimental apparatus, the production of facts, the development of theory, and the interrelation of machines and social organization.","author":[{"family":"Pickering","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"pickering1995","ISBN":"978-0-226-66803-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995",8,15]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"295","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Mangle of Practice: Time, Agency, and Science","title-short":"The Mangle of Practice","type":"book"},

Consequently, the NFDI4Health Task Force COVID-19 was established to foster the FAIRification of German COVID-19 studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Pigeot","given":"Iris"},{"family":"Ahrens","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Darms","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Fluck","given":"Juliane"},{"family":"Golebiewski","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Hahn","given":"Horst K."},{"family":"Hu","given":"Xiaoming"},{"family":"Intemann","given":"Timm"},{"family":"Kasbohm","given":"Elisa"},{"family":"Kirsten","given":"Toralf"},{"family":"Klammt","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Klopfenstein","given":"Sophie Anne Ines"},{"family":"Lassen-Schmidt","given":"Bianca"},{"family":"Peters","given":"Manuela"},{"family":"Sax","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Waltemath","given":"Dagmar"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Carsten Oliver"}],"citation-key":"pigeot2024","container-title":"Datenbank-Spektrum","container-title-short":"Datenbank Spektrum","DOI":"10.1007/s13222-024-00477-2","ISSN":"1610-1995","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"117-128","source":"Springer Link","title":"Making Epidemiological and Clinical Studies FAIR Using the Example of COVID-19","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13222-024-00477-2","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"pijpers2017","abstract":"Modern accounts of the doings of scientists habitually obscure practices of bodily knowing. This thesis therefore speculatively prolongs a critique of the disembodiment of scientists, adapted from a philosophical tradition within Science and Technology Studies. Part one takes as point of entry the inheritance of modern science to the powerful philosophical imperatives of detachment and lucidity, emphasising a body deprived of its curious, inventive, and adventurous dimension. The sensing, moving, and relational body is reclaimed in a turn to ontology, not only as situated within its world(s), but also as continuously in passage through diverging experiential, and affectual states. Conceptually extending the body invokes haptics as an indigenous theory of touch, drawing on the moved, and moving body. Through haptics, the body’s renderings of objectivity are rethought as indeterminate and hallucinatory prehensions. Required for haptic knowing is then an ethos of yielding to material alterity, animating a kind of objective (un)knowing. Part two analyses archaeological theory for its ethico-political conditions of knowing. Rethinking touch in archaeological excavations, the suggestion is made that archaeological knowing is alchemical, favouring affectual and material relations over objects. Following and observing haptic encounters between participants in excavations at the Burrough Hill Iron Age Fort, and the Ardnamurchan Transitions Project, experiential affects are found to be crucial for the contingent material continuity of archaeological knowing. These affects are shown to groove the excavation and bodies of archaeologists, in their imaginings of a knowing, responsive to events in their environment.","author":[{"family":"Pijpers","given":"Kevin Marie Joseph Paolo"}],"citation-key":"pijpers2017","genre":"phdthesis","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"publisher":"University of Leicester","title":"Haptic encounters with archaeological knowing: bodily practices in excavation","type":"thesis","URL":"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.727438"},

  {"id":"pitblado2014","abstract":"In a recent American Antiquity forum (Pitblado 2014), I argued that not only is it possible for archaeologists to engage in ethical collaborations with members of the artifact-collecting public, but that the Society for American Archaeology’s “Principles of Archaeological Ethics” stipulates that we should do so. This is not a message, however, that has fully permeated the archaeological community, which has led to a schism between populations who are often natural allies. This paper starts with that premise: that archaeologists should actively pursue collaborations with the artifact-collecting community with the goal of advancing research agendas, public education, and long-term care of collections in private hands. The paper offers guidelines for establishing and nurturing professional-collector relationships in a way that furthers the directives of legal and ethical archaeological codes. I begin with an overview of the changing nature of professional-collector relationships during the twentieth century, exploring reasons for the divisiveness that has characterized recent decades. I next suggest five steps for establishing appropriate relationships with artifact collectors—and avoiding inappropriate ones. Finally, I describe how I followed those steps to establish a network of collector-collaborators to build the foundation for a Paleoamerican research program in southeastern Idaho and northern Utah.\n, \nEn un reciente foro de American Antiquity (Pitblado 2014), argumenté que no sólo es posible que los arqueólogos se dediquen a colaboraciones éticas con miembros de la colección pública de artefactos sino que “los principios de ética arqueológica” de la Sociedad Americana de Arqueología estipula que lo hagamos. Sin embargo, este no es un mensaje que ha impregnado totalmente a la comunidad arqueológica, ya que ha dado lugar a una división entre la población que a menudo es su aliada natural. Este ensayo comienza con esta premisa: que los arqueólogos deben buscar activamente colaboraciones con la comunidad recolectora de artefactos con la meta de avanzar en los programas de investigación, educación pública y cuidado a largo plazo de las colecciones privadas. El documento ofrece pautas para el establecimiento y apoyo profesional en las relaciones con el coleccionista de una forma que promueve las normas éticas y legales de los códigos arque lógicos. Inicio con una visión general acerca de la natur leza variable de las relaciones de los profesionales y los coleccionistas durante el siglo veinte al explorar las razones de divergencia que las ha caracterizado en las últimas décadas. Posteriormente, sugiero cinco pasos para establecer relaciones adecuadas y evitar las inapropiadas con los coleccionistas de artefactos.

This article presents a case study of the data storage, sharing, and management platform Figshare. We argue that such platforms are displacing and reconfiguring the infrastructure of norms, technologies, and institutions that underlies traditional scholarly communication. Using a theoretical framework that combines infrastructure studies with platform studies, we show that Figshare leverages the platform logic of core and complementary components to re-integrate a presently splintered scholarly infrastructure. By means of this logic, platforms may provide the path to bring data inside a scholarly communication system still optimized mainly for text publications. Yet the platform strategy also risks turning over critical scientific functions to private firms whose longevity, openness, and corporate goals remain uncertain.

  {"id":"pluciennik1999","abstract":"With a few exceptions, archaeologists have been far less concerned with the form of their texts or problems of authorship than have ethnographers. Typically, archaeologies are presented in the form of narratives understood as sequential stories. Approaches to narrative analysis drawn from literary theory, philosophy, and sociology and definitions of characters, events, and plots are examined, together with particular problems these may pose for the discipline of archaeology. It is suggested that neither literary analysis nor the tendency to write and evaluate archaeological and historical narratives in terms of explanatory value takes sufficient account of the often hybrid nature and aims of these texts and the contexts in which they were produced. This argument is illustrated with particular reference to stories of the Mesolithic‐Neolithic transition in Europe. It is argued that reconsidering archaeology's positioning across the 19th‐century science‐humanities divide suggests a broader approach to the idea of what constitutes a narrative which can offer fresh opportunities for useful reflexivity and experimentation in presentation. Further roles and possibilities of narrative and non‐narrative ways of writing archaeologies are also considered.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Pluciennik","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"pluciennik1999","container-title":"Current Anthropology","container-title-short":"Current Anthropology","DOI":"10.1086/300085","ISSN":"0011-3204","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",12,1]]},"page":"653-678","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Archaeological Narratives and Other Ways of Telling","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/300085","volume":"40"},

The characteristic stamped designs on Swift Creek pottery, created by impressing a carved paddle into a clay vessel before firing, provide unique signatures that enable archaeologists to identify paddle matches—multiple vessels, sometimes hundreds of kilometers apart, stamped with a single paddle. These paddle matches potentially allow archaeologists to trace social interactions across hundreds of kilometers with high spatial and temporal resolution. To date, however, this potential has been hindered by the limited accessibility and fragmented nature of the dataset of reconstructed designs. The database we describe integrates paddle designs with other pertinent data for identifying paddle matches and their context, including the results of sourcing and technofunctional analyses and absolute dating.

The limited recognition and reception of Gardin's innovative computer application to the humanities are addressed through two factors, in addition to the effects of historiography and bibliographies on the recording, discoverability, and reuse of scientific productions: (1) funding policies, evidenced by the transfer of research effort on graph applications from temporary interdisciplinary spaces to disciplinary organizations related to the then-emerging field of computer science; and (2) the erratic careers of algorithms, in which efficiency, flaws, corrections, and authors' status, were determining factors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Plutniak","given":"Sébastien"}],"citation-key":"plutniak2021","container-title":"Interdisciplinary Science Reviews","DOI":"10.1080/03080188.2021.1877502","ISSN":"0308-0188","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,2]]},"page":"547-568","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Assyrian merchants meet nuclear physicists: history of the early contributions from social sciences to computer science.

  {"id":"poirier2017","abstract":"This paper examines how legacies of thinking about ontology, logic, and how best to approach knowledge representation have become interwoven in the architecture of the technologies that enable a Semantic Web. As a cultural anthropologist, I approach this study with qualitative historical and ethnographic methodologies, positioning the community of researchers that have been involved in the design and implementation of Semantic Web protocols and technologies as my primary field site. Two concepts from Science and Technology Studies are introduced - thought styles and design logics. The paper demonstrates how diverse thinking about how to approach knowledge representation on the Web is rooted in debates that emerged in artificial intelligence in the 1970s and 1980s. It then goes on to discuss how the diverse approaches to Web semantics that emerged from these legacies have cultural and political implications. The paper concludes with a call for further research that positions Web architectures as objects of social and cultural study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Poirier","given":"Lindsay"}],"citation-key":"poirier2017","collection-title":"WebSci '17","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Web Science Conference","DOI":"10.1145/3091478.3091505","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-4896-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,25]]},"page":"359–367","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"A Turn for the Scruffy: An Ethnographic Study of Semantic Web Architecture","title-short":"A Turn for the Scruffy","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3091478.3091505"},

  {"id":"politis2001","abstract":"This article discusses several aspects of the practice of archaeology in South America, specifically in the Southern Cone. Examining two key issues: the socio-political context of knowledge production and the positioning of South American archaeology in relation to its European and North American counterparts. Three cases that bridge these issues are examined. First, Gero’s argument for gender bias in the recording of field data, based in her ethnographic work during the excavation of the Paleondian site of Arroyo Seco 2. Second, the reburial of the human remains of Inakayal (an Indian chief who died at the end of the nineteenth century). Third, the excavation of the Inca mummies of the Llullaillaco peak in the southern Andes. The first is a critique on methodological grounds, the second demonstrates that Argentinean archaeology cannot free itself from its colonial past and the third illustrates the ethical dimension of archaeological praxis, specifically the complex interaction between local and foreign archaeologists.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Politis","given":"Gustavo"}],"citation-key":"politis2001","container-title":"Journal of Social Archaeology","container-title-short":"Journal of Social Archaeology","DOI":"10.1177/146960530100100107","ISSN":"1469-6053","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",6,1]]},"language":"english","page":"90–107","title":"On archaeological praxis, gender bias and indigenous peoples in South America","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/146960530100100107","volume":"1"},
  {"id":"politopoulos2019","abstract":"Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series is one the entertainment industry's most popular titles set in the past. With a new game released on an annual basis—each full of distinct historical places, events, and people—the series has unfolded across post-classical history, from the Levant during the Third Crusade to Victorian-era London. The 2017 release of Assassin's Creed: Origins, which entailed a massive reconstruction of Hellenistic Egypt, pushed the series even further back in time. With it, Ubisoft also launched its Discovery Tour, allowing players to explore the game's setting at their leisure and without combat. These trends continued in 2018's Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, set in Greece during the Peloponnesian War. This review discusses the narrative, world, and gameplay of the latest Assassin's Creed within the series more broadly. We provide a critical appraisal of the experience that Odyssey offers and link it to this question: in the Assassin's Creed series, do we engage in meaningful play with the past, or are we simply assassinating our way through history?","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Politopoulos","given":"Aris"},{"family":"Mol","given":"Angus A.

  {"id":"politopoulos2024","abstract":"Scholars of the past frame the ‘origins’ or evolution of inequality, usually using archaeological or anthropological evidence as a basis for their arguments, as an intentional, inevitable, important step towards the development of states, implicitly framed as the pinnacle of human political and economic achievement. Anarchist archaeologies reject the idea of hierarchy as a positive or inevitable evolutionary outcome underlying the path to civilization. We argue instead for a radical reorientation towards archaeologies of equality. We propose a prefigurative archaeology that celebrates the myriad ways that human beings have actively undermined and resisted hierarchical social arrangements. We aim to reorient archaeology's focus towards societies that purposefully prevented or constrained the emergence of inequality. To demonstrate the potential of archaeologies of equality we present case examples from Oceania, Britain, West Asia and the American Southwest. Highlighting the accomplishments of societies of equals in the past demonstrates the contingency and problematic nature of present forms of inequality. It allows us to explore a different set of pasts and thus enact different presents as we imagine different futures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Politopoulos","given":"Aris"},{"family":"Frieman","given":"Catherine J."},{"family":"Flexner","given":"James L."},{"family":"Borck","given":"Lewis"}],"citation-key":"politopoulos2024","container-title":"Cambridge Archaeological Journal","DOI":"10.1017/S0959774323000483","ISSN":"0959-7743, 1474-0540","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,11]]},"language":"en","page":"1-15","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"An Anarchist Archaeology of Equality: Pasts and Futures Against Hierarchy","title-short":"An Anarchist Archaeology of Equality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-archaeological-journal/article/an-anarchist-archaeology-of-equality-pasts-and-futures-against-hierarchy/49631CB34E61B09D54E3134E58DBB5A0"},

  {"id":"polymenakos2019","abstract":"Prehistoric cemeteries are important and unique sources of funerary and social practices from the early stages of civilization, but also a highly challenging environment for geophysical investigation. This study evaluates the results of a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey for the detection and mapping of simple, small-sized, box-shaped graves, placed at small depths at the Late Bronze Age Ayios Vasilios North Cemetery (Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece). Interpreted grave anomalies allowed post-survey excavations to verify and not miss existent graves, but also led to the exploration of several anomalies that were not graves. We highlight and analyze in detail anomalies possibly related to graves in plan- and profile-view, compare them to real structures from pre- and post-survey excavation findings, and search for solutions for an efficient identification of GPR anomalies with graves and increase of the effectiveness and dependability of GPR for grave searching in complex site conditions, which include strong variations between geological and anthropogenic structure. We propose a procedure for refining grave interpretation that utilizes the results of both initial and advanced processing of 2D and 3D GPR data. The results of our study will benefit the use of GPR as a non-invasive method to search for small-sized graves placed at small depths in complex subsurface conditions and extend GPR use to investigate the organization and function of prehistoric cemetery sites in an intensively used space.

In comparison with other methods of 3D scanning, photogrammetry has the benefits of being relatively inexpensive, mobile, and more adaptable for use in field conditions. As part of a larger project to document variability in lithic production systems across the Middle to Upper Paleolithic Transition in Western Europe, we developed a photography rig for the express purpose of systematically capturing images for the creation of 3D photogrammetric models. This low-cost rig greatly streamlines both the photo-taking and post-processing stages of model creation. Additional tips relating to the coating of difficult-to-capture objects with a mineral spray are also provided. Three-dimensional models of lithic cores from the Châtelperronian, Protoaurignacian, and Early Aurignacian levels of the site of Les Cottés (France) are presented as examples of the quality of model that can be produced using this system.\n, \nModelar artefactos en 3D se está convirtiendo en una de las herramientas más utilizadas en arqueología.

  {"id":"poullis2019","abstract":"Throughout the history of the Mediterranean region, seafaring and trading played a significant role in the interaction between the cultures and people in the area. In order to engage the general public in learning about maritime cultural heritage we have designed and developed a serious game incorporating geospatially analyzed data from open GIS archaeological maritime sources, and archaeological data resulting from shipwreck excavations. We present a second prototype of the seafaring serious game, and discuss the results of an evaluation which involved a large multi-site user study with participants from three continents. More specifically, we present the evaluation of “The Seafarers” a strategy-based game which integrates knowledge from multiple disciplines in order to educate the user through playing. A first prototype was reported in Philbin-Briscoe et al. (2017) where an expert-user evaluation of the usability and the effectiveness of the game in terms of the learning objectives was performed. In this paper, we present how the outcomes of the evaluation of the first prototype “The Seafarers – 1” by expert-users were used in the redesign and development of the game mechanics for the second prototype “The Seafarers-2”. We then present our methodology for evaluating the game with respect to the game objective of engagement in learning about maritime cultural heritage, seafaring and trading in particular. Specifically, the evaluation was to test the hypothesis that game playing allows for more engaged learning thus improving longer-term knowledge retention. The evaluation was conducted in two phases and includes a pilot study, followed by a multi-site, multi-continent user-study involving a large number of participants. We analyze the results of the user evaluation and discuss the outcomes.

  {"id":"powless2019","abstract":"Over the past few years, the lead author has had the opportunity to excavate multiple large sites in California, working on behalf of developers to keep their projects in compliance with their permits. She also worked in conjunction with local tribes to resolve burial issues with each excavation. During these excavations, she observed the challenges that the tribes encountered when dealing with fast-paced cultural resource management (CRM) projects where burial retrieval and a shortage of resources were the norm. For many years, archaeologists have viewed CRM as only dealing with the material culture of the past; however, archaeologists also consult and work with living cultures. This article will address the endemic problem in CRM that stems from a lack of planning, preparation, resources, and training and how it affects the burial excavations that archaeologists and tribes encounter in the CRM setting. It will also look for solutions to remedy a long-broken system that continues to ignore existing laws set in place to protect resources, as well as the relationships between the Native American community, agencies, researchers, and land developers., En los últimos años, he tenido la oportunidad de excavar en múltiples sitios de gran tamaño en California, trabajando por cuenta de empresas de desarrollo para mantener sus proyectos en conformidad con los permisos otorgados por entes gubernamentales. También he trabajado en conjunto con grupos locales de Nativos Americanos para resolver problemas relacionados con entierros humanos en cada excavación. Durante estas excavaciones, he observado los desafíos a los cuales se enfrentan estas tribus cuando se trata de proyectos acelerados de gestión de recursos culturales (CRM, por sus siglas en inglés), en los cuales la norma es recuperar los escasos recursos óseos presentes. Durante muchos años, los arqueólogos han considerado que los proyectos de CRM solo se ocupan de la cultura material del pasado; sin embargo, los arqueólogos también consultamos y trabajamos con culturas vivas. Este documento aborda un problema endémico en los proyectos de CRM que se deriva de la falta de planificación, preparación, recursos y capacitación. Este problema afecta las excavaciones funerarias a las que los arqueólogos y las tribus se enfrentan en proyectos de CRM. También se buscan soluciones para remediar un sistema roto desde hace tiempo que continúa ignorando las leyes establecidas para proteger los recursos culturales, así como las relaciones entre las comunidades de Nativos Americanos, los entes gubernamentales, los investigadores y las empresas de desarrollo.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Powless","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Freiwald","given":"Carolyn"}],"citation-key":"powless2019","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2018.44","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2]]},"language":"en","page":"55-59","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"The Challenges of Dealing with Human Remains in Cultural Resource Management","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/challenges-of-dealing-with-human-remains-in-cultural-resource-management/45AF4F95411C9EA99EEA9DF355C16AC7","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"pownall2021","abstract":"Open science aims to improve the rigor, robustness, and reproducibility of psychological research. Despite resistance from some academics, the open science movement has been championed by some early career researchers (ECRs), who have proposed innovative new tools and methods to promote and employ open research principles. Feminist ECRs have much to contribute to this emerging way of doing research. However, they face unique barriers, which may prohibit their full engagement with the open science movement. We, 10 feminist ECRs in psychology from a diverse range of academic and personal backgrounds, explore open science through a feminist lens to consider how voice and power may be negotiated in unique ways for ECRs. Taking a critical and intersectional approach, we discuss how feminist early career research may be complemented or challenged by shifts towards open science. We also propose how ECRs can act as grass-roots changemakers within the context of academic precarity. We identify ways in which open science can benefit from feminist epistemology and end with envisaging a future for feminist ECRs who wish to engage with open science practices in their own research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Pownall","given":"Madeleine"},{"family":"Talbot","given":"Catherine V."},{"family":"Henschel","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Lautarescu","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Lloyd","given":"Kelly E."},{"family":"Hartmann","given":"Helena"},{"family":"Darda","given":"Kohinoor M."},{"family":"Tang","given":"Karen T.

  {"id":"pownall2023","abstract":"In recent years, the scientific community has called for improvements in the credibility, robustness and reproducibility of research, characterized by increased interest and promotion of open and transparent research practices. While progress has been positive, there is a lack of consideration about how this approach can be embedded into undergraduate and postgraduate research training. Specifically, a critical overview of the literature which investigates how integrating open and reproducible science may influence student outcomes is needed. In this paper, we provide the first critical review of literature surrounding the integration of open and reproducible scholarship into teaching and learning and its associated outcomes in students. Our review highlighted how embedding open and reproducible scholarship appears to be associated with (i) students' scientific literacies (i.e. students’ understanding of open research, consumption of science and the development of transferable skills); (ii) student engagement (i.e. motivation and engagement with learning, collaboration and engagement in open research) and (iii) students' attitudes towards science (i.e. trust in science and confidence in research findings). However, our review also identified a need for more robust and rigorous methods within pedagogical research, including more interventional and experimental evaluations of teaching practice. We discuss implications for teaching and learning scholarship.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Pownall","given":"Madeleine"},{"family":"Azevedo","given":"Flávio"},{"family":"König","given":"Laura M."},{"family":"Slack","given":"Hannah R."},{"family":"Evans","given":"Thomas Rhys"},{"family":"Flack","given":"Zoe"},{"family":"Grinschgl","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Elsherif","given":"Mahmoud M."},{"family":"Gilligan-Lee","given":"Katie A."},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Catia M.

  {"id":"prignano2019","abstract":"Ancient regional routes were vital for interactions between settlements and deeply influenced the development of past societies and their “complexification”. At the same time, since any transportation infrastructure needs some level of inter-settlement cooperation to be established, they can also be regarded as an epiphenomenon of social interactions at the regional scale. Here, we propose to analyze ancient pathway networks to understand the organization of cities and villages located in a certain territory, attempting to clarify whether such organization existed and if so, how it functioned. To address such a question, we chose a quantitative approach. Adopting network science as a general framework, by means of formal models, we try to identify how the collective effort that produced the terrestrial infrastructure was directed and organized. We selected a paradigmatic case study: Iron Age southern Etruria, a very well-studied context, with detailed archaeological information about settlement patterns and an established tradition of studies on terrestrial transportation routes, perfectly suitable for testing new techniques. The results of the modelling suggest that a balanced coordinated decision-making process was shaping the route network in Etruria, a scenario which correlates well with the picture elaborated by different scholars using a more traditional technique.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Prignano","given":"Luce"},{"family":"Morer","given":"Ignacio"},{"family":"Fulminante","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Lozano","given":"Sergi"}],"citation-key":"prignano2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2019.02.007","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,1]]},"page":"46-58","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Modelling terrestrial route networks to understand inter-polity interactions (southern Etruria, 950-500 BC)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440318306630","volume":"105"},

The majority of these reconstructions focused upon viewsheds and movement, illustrating how individuals visually observed their environment and navigated through it.

While the topic of sound has been discussed within phenomenology at the theoretical level, and has been approached at the site level through the growing study of “acoustic archaeology,” there has been limited practical application at the landscape level.

Sharp-edged stone flakes, struck from larger cores, are the primary evidence for the earliest stone technology. Here we show that wild bearded capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus) in Brazil deliberately break stones, unintentionally producing recurrent, conchoidally fractured, sharp-edged flakes and cores that have the characteristics and morphology of intentionally produced hominin tools. The production of archaeologically visible cores and flakes is therefore no longer unique to the human lineage, providing a comparative perspective on the emergence of lithic technology.

  {"id":"quinn2020","abstract":"As archaeologists expand the accessibility of legacy data, they have an opportunity to use these datasets to design future research. We argue that legacy data can be a critical resource to help predict characteristics of sites and socioeconomic systems. In this article, we present a combined geographic information system (GIS) and network analysis methodology that turns site location data into testable hypotheses about site characteristics and the organization of regional settlement systems. We demonstrate the utility of this approach with a case study: Bronze Age (2700–1100 BC) settlement patterns in the mining region of Hunedoara in southwest Transylvania, Romania. We leverage unsystematically collected site location information in legacy datasets to develop testable predictions about sites, regional networks, and socioeconomic systems that can be evaluated through future systematic surveys and large-scale excavations. Such testable hypotheses can inform archaeological research design by providing a quantitative basis for determining where to focus research efforts and can also help secure funding and fieldwork permits. The method developed here can be applied in diverse archaeological contexts to reinvigorate legacy data as part of future archaeological research design., A medida que los arqueólogos amplían la accesibilidad de los datos legados, tenemos la oportunidad de utilizar estos datos para diseñar investigaciones futuras. Proponemos que los datos legados pueden ser un recurso crítico para predecir las características de sitios arqueológicos y sistemas socioeconómicos. En este manuscrito, presentamos una metodología combinada de análisis de redes y SIG que convierte los datos de ubicación de sitios arqueológicos en hipótesis comprobables sobre las características del sitio y la organización de los sistemas regionales de asentamiento. Demostramos la utilidad de este enfoque con un caso práctico: patrones de asentamiento de la Edad de Bronce (2700-1100 aC) en la región minera de Hunedoara en el suroeste de Transilvania, Rumania. Aprovechamos la información de ubicación de sitios recopilada de manera no sistemática en conjuntos de datos legados para desarrollar predicciones comprobables sobre sitios, redes regionales y sistemas socioeconómicos que se pueden evaluar a través de encuestas sistemáticas futuras y excavaciones de gran escala. Dichas hipótesis comprobables pueden informar el diseño de la investigación arqueológica al proporcionar una base cuantitativa para determinar dónde enfocar los esfuerzos de investigación y utilizarse para ayudar a asegurar la financiación y los permisos de trabajo de campo.

  {"id":"raad2019","abstract":"Beads were an important form of personal ornamentation in southern Levantine Pre-Pottery Neolithic societies and hold information on symbolic practices and exchange networks engaged by these communities. Establishing the exact mineralogical composition of stone beads and the precise methods used to manufacture beads are key to documenting shifts in these systems, but so far visual inspection has served as the primary mode of analysis for most assemblages. Here, we apply XRD and 3D digital optical microscopy to investigate raw material selection and bead manufacture at the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) settlement of el-Hemmeh, Jordan. Analyses reveal that PPNA bead assemblages emphasize the color green but included a wide variety of mineral types. The LPPNB assemblage exhibits a greater diversity in shape and color, including an emphasis on the use of red minerals, but consist of a more restricted range of minerals and lack the rectangular beads found in the PPNA. Color rather than suitability of material properties for bead making appears to have motivated choices for mineral selection. Bidirectional perforation was codified into the technological system and was consistently used to produce beads during the PPNA regardless of their size, thickness, or hardness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Raad","given":"Danielle R."},{"family":"Makarewicz","given":"Cheryl A."}],"citation-key":"raad2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2018.11.005","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,1]]},"page":"731-745","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Application of XRD and digital optical microscopy to investigate lapidary technologies in Pre-Pottery Neolithic societies","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18300956","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"rainio2017","abstract":"In northern Finland, near the canyon lakes of Julma-Ölkky, Somerjärvi, and Rotkojärvi, steep rock cliffs produce distinctive acoustic spaces. On these cliffs, prehistoric rock paintings (5200 to 1000 BC) as well as an ancient Sámi offering site (circa 1100 to present) can be found. Ethnographic sources describe that the Sámi used to sing and listen to echoes while making offerings there. This article presents the results of an archaeoacoustic research project that seeks to explore the role of sound in the development and use of these archaeological sites. The innovative set of methods includes multichannel impulse response recording, angle-of-arrival estimation of early reflections, spectrum analysis, digital image processing, and 3D laser scanning. On the basis of the analyses, it is concluded that the cliffs that have been painted or held as sacred are efficient sound reflectors. They create discrete echoes and, accordingly, phantom sound sources. Especially at the Värikallio cliff near Lake Somerjärvi, the sound appears to emanate directly from the painted figures. These results, together with previously unnoticed drumming figures in the Värikallio painting, provide a clue to the significance of the sound rituals at these sacred sites.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Rainio","given":"Riitta"},{"family":"Lahelma","given":"Antti"},{"family":"Äikäs","given":"Tiina"},{"family":"Lassfolk","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Okkonen","given":"Jari"}],"citation-key":"rainio2017","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-017-9343-1","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",7,17]]},"language":"en","page":"1-22","source":"link-springer-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca","title":"Acoustic Measurements and Digital Image Processing Suggest a Link Between Sound Rituals and Sacred Sites in Northern Finland","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-017-9343-1"},

Divergences of opinion, genres, approaches, methodologies, and methods exist, resulting in disagreement on what GT methodology is and how it comes to be. From the postpositivism of Glaser and Strauss, to the symbolic interactionist roots of Strauss and Corbin, through to the constructivism of Charmaz, the field of GT methodology is distinctive in the sense that those using it offer new ontological, epistemological, and methodological perspectives at specific moments in time. We explore the unusual dynamism attached to GT’s underpinnings. Our view is that through a process of symbolic interactionism, in which generations of researchers interact with their context, moments are formed and philosophical perspectives are interpreted in a manner congruent with GT’s essential methods. We call this methodological dynamism, a process characterized by contextual awareness and moment formation, contemporaneous translation, generational methodology, and methodological consumerism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Ralph","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Birks","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Chapman","given":"Ysanne"}],"citation-key":"ralph2015","container-title":"International Journal of Qualitative Methods","container-title-short":"International Journal of Qualitative Methods","DOI":"10.1177/1609406915611576","ISSN":"1609-4069","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11,20]]},"language":"en","page":"1609406915611576","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Methodological Dynamism of Grounded Theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1609406915611576","volume":"14"},

Despite an important effort in providing protoforms with improved semantics that are applicable to time series data or specific application domains, type-I and type-II fuzzy quantified sentences are still predominant in the literature. In this context, we propose a different approach for defining new types of protoforms. Instead of understanding protoforms as individual primitives, our proposal draws inspiration from Rhetorical Structure Theory to provide a framework that allows to define new types of complex protoforms based on semantic relations among simpler protoforms. Based on this framework, we propose an initial taxonomy of relations among protoforms and provide an illustrative use case based on real data and evaluated by human users.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Ramos-Soto","given":"A."},{"family":"Martin-Rodilla","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"ramos-soto2021","collection-title":"Knowledge Representation and Logics","container-title":"Fuzzy Sets and Systems","container-title-short":"Fuzzy Sets and Systems","DOI":"10.1016/j.fss.2019.11.013","ISSN":"0165-0114","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-26","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Enriching linguistic descriptions of data: A framework for composite protoforms","title-short":"Enriching linguistic descriptions of data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165011419305081","volume":"407"},

Published work in both anarchic archaeology and anthropology has tended to make little use of the large and challenging body of literature created by members of anarchist political and philosophical movements over the last 180 years. This paper explores a sample of themes from anarchist literature that intersect with the interests of archaeologists. It is argued that ideas such as the anarchist use of surrealism, the anarchist take on environmentalism and radical anarchist history might all provide useful inspiration to archaeologists. It is clear however that the nature of the alternative philosophies utilized by anarchists will not make incorporating the work into archaeology a straightforward task, and archaeologists themselves are not exempt from the critical analysis of anarchists.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Rathbone","given":"Stuart"}],"citation-key":"rathbone2017","container-title":"World Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00438243.2017.1333921","ISSN":"0043-8243","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",5,27]]},"page":"291-305","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Anarchist literature and the development of anarchist counter-archaeologies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00438243.2017.1333921","volume":"49"},

Instead of explaining Linux's successes and failures as due to novel social or technical arrangements, or because of a particular historical moment, I claim that both Linux's success at maintaining coordinated development and its failure to attract a wider audience are related to what I have termed the pressure of openness—a contradictory yet productive relationship between the need to maintain coordinated development activity and the need to remain open to new development directions and new participants.

A key element of this framework is an understanding of software programs as simultaneously rhetorical and tangible objects.

  {"id":"ratto2006a","abstract":"In this paper we explore new developments in genomics, in particular the move from data sequencing efforts like the Human Genome Project (HGP), to newer forms of data-driven genomic work that focus explicitly on the complicated relationship between genes and environment. We compare the use of a key term within the HGP, the metaphor of “foundation,” to the use of a different term, the metaphor of “profile,” within the GenomEUtwin consortium, an exemplar of “post-genomic” projects. By doing so, we attempt to re-think the role of language and metaphor in scientific projects and explore new developments in post-genomic research. These developments include: first, the movement towards an explicit and programmatic acknowledgement of the complexity of gene and trait relationships, second, the use of bio-informatics techniques as exploratory tools of discovery rather than as part of a more straightforward “decoding” effort, third, the development of network infrastructures that link up and provide access to a vast array of different databases, and fourth, the alignment between various disciplines and interests within biology, clinical work, and public health initiatives. We use the metaphor of “splicing” to emphasize the heterogeneous work of scientists engaged in “weaving together” the diverse set of ideas, interests, and players necessary for the success of large-scale scientific projects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Ratto","given":"Matt"}],"citation-key":"ratto2006a","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963662506056786","ISSN":"0963-6625","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"31-53","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Foundations and profiles: splicing metaphors in genetic databases and biobanks","title-short":"Foundations and profiles","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662506056786","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"rawls2008","abstract":"Known primarily as the author of a method for studying work, Harold Garfinkel — and ethnomethodological studies of work, or workplace studies — also offer an important alternative theory of work. First articulated in the late 1940s and early 1950s as a theory of communication, organization, and information, it has been Garfinkel’s proposal that mutual understanding (orienting objects, meaning, and identities) in interactions, including technical situations of work, requires constant mutual orientation to situated constitutive expectancies — taken-for-granted methods of producing order that constitute sense — accompanied by displays of attention, competence, and trust. Based on this premise, researchers need to enter worksites to learn the order properties of work. Conventional theories, by contrast, treat social orders (including work) as resulting from individual interests, external constraint, and/or some conjunction between the two. For Garfinkel, however, individual motivation, power, and constraint must be managed by workers in and through the details of work. He insists that the need for participants to mutually orient ways of producing order on each next occasion adequately explains the details of order and sensemaking. Thus, any worksite exhibits the details required to produce, manage and understand local orders of work, including power and constraint —details that are local matters, lost to general formulation, requiring a research approach focused on the order properties of those details.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Rawls","given":"Anne Warfield"}],"citation-key":"rawls2008","container-title":"Organization Studies","container-title-short":"Organization Studies","DOI":"10.1177/0170840608088768","ISSN":"0170-8406, 1741-3044","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",5]]},"language":"en","page":"701-732","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Harold Garfinkel, Ethnomethodology and Workplace Studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0170840608088768","volume":"29"},

In The Postgenomic Condition, Jenny Reardon critically examines the decade after the Human Genome Project, and the fundamental questions about meaning, value and justice this landmark achievement left in its wake. Drawing on more than a decade of research—in molecular biology labs, commercial startups, governmental agencies, and civic spaces—Reardon demonstrates how the extensive efforts to transform genomics from high tech informatics practiced by a few to meaningful knowledge beneficial to all exposed the limits of long-cherished liberal modes of knowing and governing life. Those in the American South challenged the value of being included in genomics when no hospital served their community.  Ethicists and lawyers charged with overseeing Scottish DNA and data questioned how to develop a system of ownership for these resources when their capacity to create things of value—new personalized treatments—remained largely unrealized. Molecular biologists who pioneered genomics asked whether their practices of thinking could survive the deluge of data produced by the growing power of sequencing machines. While the media is filled with grand visions of precision medicine, The Postgenomic Condition shares these actual challenges of the scientists, entrepreneurs, policy makers, bioethicists, lawyers, and patient advocates who sought to leverage liberal democratic practices to render genomic data a new source of meaning and value for interpreting and caring for life. It brings into rich empirical focus the resulting hard on-the-ground questions about how to know and live on a depleted but data-rich, interconnected yet fractured planet, where technoscience garners significant resources, but deeper questions of knowledge and justice urgently demand attention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Reardon","given":"Jenny"}],"citation-key":"reardon2017","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"source":"press.uchicago.edu","title":"The Postgenomic Condition","type":"book","URL":"https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo22726485.html"},

  {"id":"reeder-myers2019","abstract":"Powerful hurricanes in 2017—Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria—were stark examples of how these previously rare catastrophes are becoming increasingly normal due to climate change, with dire consequences for cultural resources. These storms, sometimes called megastorms or superstorms, were the first in which high-resolution satellite imagery was available in the immediate aftermath, providing a new tool for rapidly evaluating damage to archaeological sites. Using Hurricane Harvey as a case study, we examined two recent spatial models of archaeological site vulnerability to long-term climate change to determine whether these models are also adequate for predicting the impacts of short-term climate catastrophes. We further examined a number of individual variables that we expected to be useful in predicting which sites would be most vulnerable to flooding, such as proximity to rivers, the coast, or the floodplain. Neither the models nor the individual variables correlated well to increased risk to archaeological sites, with the exception of land use. Sites located within developed areas benefited from measures to protect property and were less often flooded. We suggest that strategies for responding to megastorms would be most effective through a combination of preparedness, analysis of remote sensing data, and existing field research methods., Los huracanes poderosos de 2017 —Harvey, Irma y María—fueron un claro ejemplo de cómo estas catástrofes, anteriormente raras, se están volviendo cada vez más comunes debido al cambio climático, con graves consecuencias para los recursos culturales. Estas supertormentas fueron las primeras para las que se obtuvieron imágenes satelitales de alta resolución inmediatamente después de su paso. Esto proporcionó una nueva herramienta para evaluar rápidamente los daños a los sitios arqueológicos. Usando el huracán Harvey como estudio de caso, examinamos dos modelos espaciales recientes de la vulnerabilidad de los sitios arqueológicos al cambio climático a largo plazo para determinar si estos modelos también son adecuados para predecir los impactos de catástrofes climáticas a corto plazo. Además, examinamos una serie de variables individuales posiblemente útiles para identificar los sitios más vulnerables a las inundaciones, como por ejemplo la proximidad a los ríos, la costa o la llanura aluvial. Ni los modelos ni las variables individuales se correlacionaron bien con un mayor riesgo de inundación, con la excepción del uso de la tierra. Los sitios ubicados dentro de áreas desarrolladas se beneficiaron de medidas para proteger esas propiedades y fueron inundados con menor frecuencia.

  {"id":"reedy2014","abstract":"Thin-section petrography is a crucial tool for the study of archaeological ceramics, and in recent years, image analysis has emerged as a powerful quantitative enhancement of that tool. Exploratory applications of image analysis to archaeological ceramic thin sections, and related work by sedimentary geologists, have indicated its usefulness to the field. In this paper, we first present the results of experimental work testing the consistency and reproducibility of image analysis. We identify procedures for fast and reliable analysis of thin sections using laboratory-prepared ceramic specimens of simple clay-sand systems. We then show how those procedures can be slightly modified to accommodate more complex archaeological specimens. We conclude with a discussion of the role of image analysis within the overall context of thin-section petrography of ceramic materials, as one among a repertoire of techniques, adding quantitative data and increasing the usefulness of ceramic thin sections for addressing archaeological research questions.\n, \nLa petrografía de lámina delgada constituye una herramienta fundamental para el estudio de cerámicas arqueológicas y en los últimos años, ha surgido el análisis de imágenes como una mejora cuantitativa importante para dicha herramienta.

  {"id":"reese2021","abstract":"Full-coverage pedestrian survey to record cultural features on unexplored archaeological landscapes is costly in terms of time, money, and personnel. Over the past two decades, researchers have implemented remote sensing and landscape data collection techniques using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to combat some of these burdens, but the initial cost of equipment, software, and processing power has hindered the ubiquitous implementation of UAV technology as an accessible companion tool to traditional archaeological survey. This article presents a free and open-source, technology-independent analytical framework for the collection and processing of UAV images to produce high-resolution digital terrain models limited only by the equipment available to the researcher. Results from the free and open-source protocol are directly compared to those produced using proprietary software to illustrate the capabilities of freely available data processing tools for UAV-collected images. By replicating the methods outlined here, researchers should be able to identify and target areas of interest to increase fieldwork efficiency, decrease costs of implementing this technology, and produce high-resolution digital terrain models to conduct spatial analyses that pursue a deeper understanding of cultural landscapes.\n, \nEl estudio peatonal de cobertura completa para registrar características culturales en paisajes arqueológicos inexplorados es costoso en términos de tiempo, dinero y personal.

  {"id":"reeves2015","abstract":"In 2012, the Archaeology Department at James Madison’s Montpelier began an experimental program with Minelab Americas to encourage metal detectorists to become more involved in the scientific process of archaeological research. Specifically, the program is designed to be a week-long experience in which archaeologists and metal detectorists work together to identify and preserve archaeological sites at the 2,700-acre Montpelier property. In the process, the metal detector participants are taught the importance of site preservation through background lectures and hands-on field training in which they use their metal detectors as a remote sensing device. Participants learn how gridded metal detector surveys are conducted and the importance of proper context and curation of recovered objects. The team-based approach of our program has resulted in a co-creation process whereby metal detectorists bring to the table their skills in using their machines to identify subtle metallic artifact signals and archaeologists bring the skill of systematic survey techniques to map and record archaeological sites. In the end, teamwork encourages open and frank discussions regarding the interface between metal detecting and the archaeological communities and has gone a long way toward reconciling differences between these two groups who have a long history of strained relations.\n, \nEn 2012, el departamento de arqueología de James Madison Montpelier dio inicio a un programa experimental con Minelab Americas para alentar a los usuarios de detectores de metales a que se involucren de manera más cercana con el proceso científico de la investigación arqueológica. Específicamente, el programa que se ha diseñado se lleva acabo en una semana, durante la cual, los arqueólogos y los usuarios de detectores de metales trabajan juntos para identificar y preservar los sitios arqueológicos que se ubican en los 2,700 acres que comprende la propiedad de Montpelier. Como parte de este proceso, a los usuarios de detectores de metales se les enseña la importancia de la preservación de sitios a partir de conferencias en donde se les plantean los antecedentes y se les proporciona capacitación para usar sus detectores de metales como instrumentos de prospección remota. Los participantes aprenden como desarrollar recorridos reticulados con el detector de metales, así como la importancia del contexto y de la curaduría de los objetos. El enfoque del trabajo en equipo ha resultado ser un proceso de creación en colaboración mediante el cual, los usuarios de detectores de metales ponen sobre la mesa sus habilidades en el uso de estos instrumentos para identificar las señales metálicas sutiles que emiten los artefactos y los arqueólogos aportan el potencial de las técnicas del recorrido de superficie sistemático para mapear y registrar sitios arqueológicos. Finalmente, el trabajo en equipo fomenta discusiones abiertas y directas en torno a la interfase entre los usuarios de detectores de metales y las comunidades de arqueólogos, lo que representa un gran avance hacia la reconciliación de las diferencias existentes entre estos dos grupos que han mantenido relaciones tensas por mucho tiempo.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Reeves","given":"Matthew"}],"citation-key":"reeves2015","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.7183/2326-3768.3.3.263","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",8]]},"language":"en","page":"263-274","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Sleeping with the “Enemy”: Metal Detecting Hobbyists and Archaeologists","title-short":"Sleeping with the “Enemy”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/sleeping-with-the-enemy/0819FED5D9B5E0D61BE75C0642CD655C","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"renzulli2019","abstract":"New discoveries of flat Archaic querns recovered from the cargo of a Phoenician shipwreck at a depth of 110 m in Xlendi Bay (Gozo, Maltese Islands) dated to ca. 7th century BC and millstone fragments found at Cerro del Castillo (Cádiz, Spain) from Phoenician material between 7th and 6th century BC share the same petrographic texture and geochemical composition. The four samples consist of vesicle-rich grey basaltic lavas with a moderate porphyritic index and a microcrystalline intergranular groundmass. Major and trace elements distributions of the investigated artifacts highlight a provenance from Pantelleria Island, which is located in the Mediterranean Sea between Sicily and Cape Bon (Tunisia). This rules out other important widespread sources of basic volcanic rocks that were also used for millstones in ancient times, such as Etna volcano, Iblei Mountains and the Levant. Due to its barycentric position in the Sicily Channel, Pantelleria Island could therefore have represented one of the main supplying area of volcanic millstones for the Phoenicians. The provenance from Pantelleria was already documented for other volcanic millstones in Phoenician sites and Carthaginian settlements of Sicily (e.g. Motya and Entella) and Tunisia (e.g. Utica and Carthage) and those found in the shipwreck of El Sec (off the coast of Mallorca), dated to ca. 4th century BC. The new millstones from Pantelleria discovered in (i) an older shipwreck cargo (i.e. Xlendi Bay) and (ii) the most westerly Phoenician settlement of Gadir (nowadays Cadiz, ca. 1500 km far from Pantelleria) point to widespread Phoenician trade in Pantellerian basaltic rocks in the Archaic Period. Pantelleria Island can therefore be considered as a nodal point for trade in volcanic millstones, many centuries before the Hellenistic people and the Romans would largely exploit the basaltic lavas from Etna and Iblei Mountains for the same purpose.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Renzulli","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Santi","given":"Patrizia"},{"family":"Gambin","given":"Timmy"},{"family":"Serrano","given":"Paloma Bueno"}],"citation-key":"renzulli2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.01.019","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"page":"338-349","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Pantelleria Island as a centre of production for the Archaic Phoenician trade in basaltic millstones: New evidence recovered and sampled from a shipwreck off Gozo (Malta) and a terrestrial site at Cádiz (Spain)","title-short":"Pantelleria Island as a centre of production for the Archaic Phoenician trade in basaltic millstones","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18306965","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"reti2013","abstract":"Traditional lithic artifact analyses have provided information regarding hominin ranging behaviors, raw material preferences, and the potential for functionality. However, there is currently no standard method for determining how hominins produced lithic artifacts. This dissertation research provides the first quantitative measure of flake production techniques and applies these measures to the Oldowan of Koobi Fora, Kenya and Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. Four Oldowan production behaviors are identified and are used to define what has been called the “least effort approach” to flake production in the Oldowan. Behaviorally informative measurements are taken on whole flakes and size standardized using their geometric mean. In order to attribute each archaeological flake to a production behavior, large experimental assemblages are created using native raw materials from Koobi Fora and Olduvai Gorge (n = 3,651 flakes and 443 cores). Each experimentally produced flake has empirically known production behaviors associated with it. A multivariate classification algorithm is constructed to determine a classification tree of best fit for the experimental flakes such that each flake is assigned a particular production behavior. Archaeological flakes are assessed via this classification algorithm and then compared to the experimental expectations for distribution of production behaviors.\nThe application of Oldowan archaeological assemblages to this process demonstrates that the null hypothesis that a least effort manufacturing strategy was employed at Koobi Fora cannot be rejected, but this null hypothesis can be rejected for subsets of quartzite and basalt flakes at Olduvai Gorge. Hominins at both localities demonstrate an understanding of raw material economics, but at Olduvai Gorge these hominins demonstrate a consistent ability to produce flakes in a more efficient way than a least effort approach predicts. Hominins at Olduvai Gorge consistently transport quartzite flakes to the site locations, while they consistently transport basalt cores to the sites. Koobi Fora hominins also demonstrate the ability to transport raw materials, but do not produce flakes outside of least effort expectations. Due to these differences in stone tool production strategies and lithic transport behaviors, this research argues that distinct cultural differences between hominin populations are quantifiably evident as early as the Oldowan.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Reti","given":"Joseph S."}],"citation-key":"reti2013","event-place":"United States -- New Jersey","genre":"Ph.D.","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"English","license":"Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","number-of-pages":"291","publisher":"Rutgers The State University of New Jersey - New Brunswick","publisher-place":"United States -- New Jersey","source":"ProQuest","title":"Methods for determining differential behaviors in stone tool production and application to the Oldowan of Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania and Koobi Fora, Kenya","type":"thesis","URL":"https://search.proquest.com/docview/1442199760/abstract/7DD04B22B0C14F21PQ/1"},
  {"id":"reti2016","abstract":"Recent research suggests that variation exists among and between Oldowan stone tool assemblages. Oldowan variation might represent differential constraints on raw materials used to produce these stone implements. Alternatively, variation among Oldowan assemblages could represent different methods that Oldowan producing hominins utilized to produce these lithic implements. Identifying differential patterns of stone tool production within the Oldowan has implications for assessing how stone tool technology evolved, how traditions of lithic production might have been culturally transmitted, and for defining the timing and scope of these evolutionary events. At present there is no null model to predict what morphological variation in the Oldowan should look like. Without such a model, quantifying whether Oldowan assemblages vary due to raw material constraints or whether they vary due to differences in production technique is not possible. This research establishes a null model for Oldowan lithic artifact morphological variation. To establish these expectations this research 1) models the expected range of variation through large scale reduction experiments, 2) develops an algorithm to categorize archaeological flakes based on how they are produced, and 3) statistically assesses the methods of production behavior used by Oldowan producing hominins at the site of DK from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania via the experimental model. Results indicate that a subset of quartzite flakes deviate from the null expectations in a manner that demonstrates efficiency in flake manufacture, while some basalt flakes deviate from null expectations in a manner that demonstrates inefficiency in flake manufacture. The simultaneous presence of efficiency in stone tool production for one raw material (quartzite) and inefficiency in stone tool production for another raw material (basalt) suggests that Oldowan producing hominins at DK were able to mediate the economic costs associated with stone tool procurement by utilizing high-cost materials more efficiently than is expected and low-cost materials in an inefficient manner.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Reti","given":"Jay S."}],"citation-key":"reti2016","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0147352","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,25]]},"page":"e0147352","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Quantifying Oldowan Stone Tool Production at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147352","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"ribeiro2023","abstract":"While archaeology is certainly a politically conscious discipline, with various members involved in political and activist movements, especially focusing on gender and race issues, little has been said, discussed, or done with regards to class and elitism. In fact, it seems that since the advent of postmodernity in the 1970s, class and elitism have become moot topics. The aim of this article is to reflect upon class-based discrimination and elitism in archaeology, first by tracing the changes they have undergone, especially during late capitalist times, and how class has become sublimated to fit the neoliberal agenda; second, the article focuses on several issues concerning class and elitism in the university context in general, and in archaeology in particular, and how these serve as barriers to those less wealthy and fortunate; third, this work highlights how these issues concerning class and elitism in archaeology then affect scientific discourse on one hand, which has become more technologically advanced, and consequently more expensive, and archaeological theory on the other, which in its hectic search for novelty has lost its capacity to truly contribute anything new to our understanding of past and present societies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Ribeiro","given":"Artur"},{"family":"Giamakis","given":"Christos"}],"citation-key":"ribeiro2023","container-title":"Open Archaeology","DOI":"10.1515/opar-2022-0309","ISSN":"2300-6560","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,1]]},"language":"en","publisher":"De Gruyter Open Access","source":"www-degruyter-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca","title":"On Class and Elitism in Archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opar-2022-0309/html","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"ricci2019","abstract":"Within the evolutionary dynamics of post-Gravettian techno-complexes, one can observe an intense regionalization phenomenon, both on a European scale, with the creation of two main provinces, and within the Italian peninsula. To date, typological studies have led to the recognition of several Italian Epigravettian facies, identifying trends, similarities, and differences in the lithic complexes. An important contribution was made by the technological method which in recent years has allowed us to identify the evolutionary processes of the lithic industries in numerous deposits of northern Italy. It is the intent of this reporting to add information which contributes to the debate on the latest Pleistocene complexes, expanding the area to southern Italy. The Grotta della Serratura, by virtue of a large and well-detailed stratigraphy, the optimum state of conservation of the findings, and for previous interdisciplinary studies that have been undertaken, represents an excellent reference site for the lower Tyrrhenian Italian coast. Thus it begins to bring new technological data to already known collections in an area rich in archaeological evidence that can make important contributions to the discussion of the lithic complexes in the Mediterranean area from the late Upper Paleolithic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Ricci","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Vadillo Conesa","given":"Margarita"},{"family":"Martini","given":"Fabio"}],"citation-key":"ricci2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2018.11.038","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"page":"175-191","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Through diachronic discontinuities and regionalization: The contribution of the analysis of the lithic industries from Grotta della Serratura (Strata 10-9) in the definition of Epigravettian in the southern Italian peninsula","title-short":"Through diachronic discontinuities and regionalization","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18306497","volume":"24"},

Since its birth the ADS has had to respond to rapid changes in technology, as well as major cultural and organizational changes in the external operating environment, from which a sustainable business model for digital preservation has emerged. This article will take a retrospective look at challenges that have been faced and will review current and future priorities for those seeking to establish digital repositories. Digital preservation and open access to research data are now much higher up the agenda of funding bodies, but there is still lack of agreement on what constitutes a core digital archive from a fieldwork project. The paper will review what the significant properties of an archaeological archive are, and how reuse can be supported, linking data and publications. It will consider the challenge of dealing with the gray literature and of avoiding creating further data silos, featuring new initiatives to provide interoperability between digital repositories.

  {"id":"richards2019","abstract":"The ability to geologically classify stone artefact materials is crucial because it is the first step in provenance allocation and geochemical grouping that inform archaeological models used for understanding exchange systems within prehistoric social networks. Geochemical analyses have revolutionised exchange studies by making it possible to match stone artefacts back to quarry sources, sometimes hundreds or thousands of kilometres away. Most archaeological basalt characterisation and provenance studies have relied on destructive sampling techniques to obtain the major trace elements NaO2, K2O and SiO2 (wt%) to identify volcanic rock types on the Total Alkali Silica (TAS) diagram. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents an alternative method, the Pearce W-F diagram, that determines volcanic rock type and alkalinity using elements TiO2, Zr, Y and Nb that are accurately detected by non-destructive portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF). This new method is proven to be effective in a comparison with recent XRF archaeological basalt studies in the Pacific. The power to classify volcanic rock types non-destructively with pXRF significantly increases the number of artefacts and museum objects available for inclusion in archaeological exchange studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Richards","given":"Michelle J."}],"citation-key":"richards2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2019.03.004","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,1]]},"page":"31-45","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Realising the potential of portable XRF for the geochemical classification of volcanic rock types","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440318305193","volume":"105"},

The rapid pace of change within Internet technologies has significantly expanded potential for this ‘digital’ form of Public Archaeology practice. Internet technologies can be used to gather contributions of ‘crowd-sourced’ archaeological content; to share and discuss archaeological news and discoveries; foster online community identity, situated around the topic of archaeology and wider heritage issues, or to elicit financial support. Expectations of and opportunities for social, collaborative and individual participation and interaction with cultural heritage have grown accordingly. Professional archaeological organisations are increasingly encouraged, if not required, to disseminate their grey literature reports, publications, educational resources, data-sets, images and other archaeological informatics through digital means, frequently as mandatory outputs for impact assessment and public accountability. Real-time sharing, comment and feedback of archaeological information online and via mobile technologies stand in contrast to lengthy waits for publication and wider dissemination.

The increased use of digital tools and methods for archaeological research and dissemination, as well as what Roosevelt (2015) has referred to as the shift to the digital paradigm within archaeological practice, leads us to suggest that the impact of this paradigm shift requires careful and critical examination. This article will examine the edges of the disciplines of archaeology and sociology, where we aim to advance our understanding of the relationship between digital technologies and archaeological knowledge from a uniquely social perspective, using the theoretical approaches of both classic and modern sociologists. The application of this lens of sociology to digital archaeology equips us to understand how archaeology and archaeological practice is situated in a social world, which is especially relevant in the Global West, where digital technology is ubiquitous. Through a critical consideration of the complexity of use of digital technologies within digital archaeology, we can begin to shift our focus away from the character and method of tools and workflow, to the background of intellectual power and influence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Richardson","given":"Lorna-Jane"},{"family":"Lindgren","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"richardson2017b","container-title":"Open Archaeology","DOI":"10.1515/opar-2017-0008","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"139–148","source":"DeGruyter","title":"Online Tribes and Digital Authority: What Can Social Theory Bring to Digital Archaeology?","title-short":"Online Tribes and Digital Authority","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/opar.2017.3.issue-1/opar-2017-0008/opar-2017-0008.xml","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"richardson2019","abstract":"Neolithic material engagements transformed the ways in which communities interacted with the physical world and one another. Based on evidence from the flanks of the Zagros Mountains, in western Iran and north-eastern Iraq, Robert Braidwood initially proposed his ‘Hilly Flanks’ hypothesis for the origins of agriculture and sedentism. The evidence for multi-centred developments in domestication has demonstrated that elements of these practices spanned south-west Asia in the Early Neolithic. The Zagros Mountains (and the eastern branch of the Fertile Crescent as a whole) constituted an area of vibrant engagement with new ideas, materials, experimentation and innovation, participating in the networks of interaction and exchange that facilitated the spread of alternative lifeways. This research examines how engagements with clay influenced the development and spread of new ways of thinking about the physical world, highlighting the role of clay as a transformational material through sites in the Central Zagros.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Richardson","given":"Amy"}],"citation-key":"richardson2019","container-title":"Oxford Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.1111/ojoa.12155","ISSN":"1468-0092","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","page":"2-17","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Pre-Pottery Clay Innovation in the Zagros Foothills","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ojoa.12155","volume":"38"},

  {"id":"riede2022","abstract":", The year 2021 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Robert C. Dunnell's (Free Press, 1971) diminutive yet dense Systematics in prehistory. At the height of the debate between Culture History and New Archaeology, Dunnell's work sought to address a more fundamental issue that was and still is relevant to all branches of prehistoric archaeology, and especially to the study of the Palaeolithic: systematics. Dunnell himself was notorious and controversial, but the importance of his work remains underappreciated. Like other precocious works of that tumultuous time, Systematics in prehistory today remains absent from most course reading lists and gathers dust on library shelves. In this contribution we argue for a greater appreciation of its as yet unfulfilled conceptual and analytical promise. In particular, we briefly chart its somewhat delayed impact via evolutionary archaeology, including how it has also influenced non-Anglophone traditions, especially in South America. The obstinate persistence of classification issues in palaeoanthropology and palaeoarchaeology, we argue, warrants a second look at Dunnell's Systematics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Riede","given":"Felix"},{"family":"Araujo","given":"Astolfo"},{"family":"Marwick","given":"Ben"}],"citation-key":"riede2022","container-title":"Evolutionary Human Sciences","DOI":"10.1017/ehs.2022.18","ISSN":"2513-843X","issued":{"literal":"2022/ed"},"language":"en","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Robert C.

Using a large and improved regional dataset of radiometric determinations (n = 1180) from the period 14000–3000 14C years before present, the study performs a comparative analysis of the demographic trajectories of two sub-regions, the desert coast and Andean highlands. Against the backdrop of theoretical models of population growth, and controlling for taphonomic factors and sampling biases, the study performs global significance and permutation tests on the data. These provide a necessary measure of statistical confidence that have hereto been absent from the discussion of pre-Columbian demography. Contrary to the findings of prior work, this study of radiocarbon data in Peru reveals that regional trends in the data are statistically indistinguishable. Further testing and comparison to climate archives is able to illustrate sustained population growth over the entire Holocene epoch in this region, with only a few notable exceptions at the end of the mid-Holocene (5000 cal BP). The findings of the analysis are viewed in relation to the cultural and technological changes that indigenous societies experienced in the timeframe in question, and some directions for methodological advances are suggested.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Riris","given":"Philip"}],"citation-key":"riris2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2018.06.008","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,1]]},"page":"67-76","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Dates as data revisited: A statistical examination of the Peruvian preceramic radiocarbon record","title-short":"Dates as data revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440318301067","volume":"97"},

  {"id":"rivero2019","abstract":"Rock-art recording has been significantly improved in recent years by new technologies. Nonetheless, accurate documentation of certain engravings is a challenge for these cutting-edge technologies, especially the extremely thin incised lines used in many Palaeolithic engraved motifs. In this paper, we propose a new methodology for recording these engravings with the objective of producing results comparable to the information available for Palaeolithic portable art. We are currently testing a multi-scale modelling methodology for these engravings. The objective is to produce affordable ultra-high resolution 3D models. Our methodology is completely built around close-range photogrammetry techniques, capturing scenes in increasingly higher resolutions and with different light settings. These entities are referenced to a local coordinate system allowing the overlapping of the different captures. Finally, the detailed tracings achieved from the independent higher resolution 3D models can be accurately gathered in an overall 3D model of lower resolution without geometric distortions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Rivero","given":"Olivia"},{"family":"Ruiz-López","given":"Juan F."},{"family":"Intxaurbe","given":"Iñaki"},{"family":"Salazar","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Garate","given":"Diego"}],"citation-key":"rivero2019","container-title":"Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage","container-title-short":"Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage","DOI":"10.1016/j.daach.2019.e00106","ISSN":"2212-0548","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,6]]},"page":"e00106","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"On the limits of 3D capture: A new method to approach the photogrammetric recording of palaeolithic thin incised engravings in Atxurra Cave (northern Spain)","title-short":"On the limits of 3D capture","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212054819300049"},

  {"id":"robinson2019a","abstract":"Archaeologists now routinely use summed radiocarbon dates as a measure of past population size, yet few have coupled these measures to theoretical expectations about social organization. To help move the ‘dates as data’ approach from description to explanation, this paper proposes a new integrative theory and method for quantitative analyses of radiocarbon summed probability distributions (SPDs) in space. We present this new approach to ‘SPDs in space’ with a case study of 3571 geo-referenced radiocarbon dates from Wyoming, USA. We develop a SPD for the Holocene in Wyoming, then analyze the spatial distribution of the SPD as a function of time using a standard nearest-neighbor statistic. We compare population growth and decline throughout the Holocene with expectations for different Ideal Distribution Models from population ecology that predict the relationship between habitat quality and population density. Results suggest that populations in Wyoming were initially clustered and then became increasingly dispersed through the course of the Holocene.

  {"id":"robinson2019b","abstract":"The Neolithic temples of Malta are among the oldest examples of prehistoric architecture, yet the construction of their roofs remains a mystery. The absence of any roofs or roofing material at the temple sites has resulted in conjecture regarding the original appearance of these megalithic structures. The most valuable indications of prehistoric Maltese roof architecture are found in the Neolithic burial complex, the Hypogeum of Hal Saflieni. Two chambers in the Hypogeum are modelled closely after the above-ground temples, with indications of a roof structural system on the ceilings. This paper uses LiDAR and photogrammetry-derived 3D models to provide a partial temple roof reconstruction that has its design entirely based on contemporaneous archaeology. Photogrammetric reconstruction of the Mnajdra and Tarxien temple complexes allowed for detailed architectural analyses including key structural features and any indications of previous roof construction that would be evident in situ. A LiDAR model of the carved chambers of the Hypogeum of Hal Saflieni was superimposed onto corresponding positions in the temple models. Merging the LiDAR imagery onto the photogrammetry temple models confirmed structural consistency between the two megalithic complexes; supporting the theory that the carved façades were a deliberate reflection of the original architecture of the Maltese temples. This evidence points to an entirely new temple roof reconstruction, founded upon the archaeology of Neolithic Malta.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Robinson","given":"Madeline G.

  {"id":"rogers2020","abstract":"Combining the strengths of “traditional” documentary filmmaking (as “creative treatments of actualité”) with the immersive power of interactive digital technologies (from 360° video to VR to data mining to algorithms), i-Docs can transform audiences into participants, co-creators, and collaborators in nonfiction storytelling, allowing them to not only explore and experience a story on their own terms but to remix, share, and contribute their own content to a collective story. i-Docs are cross- and multiplatform, screening across cinema, computers, smartphones, and gallery installations. Showcased at leading film festivals, increasingly adopted by broadcasters—including PBS, Al Jazeera, and BBC—and critically acclaimed from the Webbys and the Pulitzers to Cannes, the i-Doc sector is set to boom. After a close reading of two i-Docs, Hunt for the Inca Ruins (2017) and Saydnaya (2016), I consider the potential of i-Docs to resolve archaeologists’ concerns about misrepresentation, accuracy, information quality, (co)authorship, and crediting original research in documentary storytelling. I also examine the sector's shortcomings of unstable production pathways, funding sources, technologies, and difficulties assessing impact. I propose that archaeologists should engage proactively with the i-Doc sector if we wish to avoid the pitfalls previously encountered in film and factual TV and make the most of this new format.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Rogers","given":"Kathryn E."}],"citation-key":"rogers2020","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2020.37","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11]]},"language":"en","page":"428-433","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Story First, Technology Second: How i-Docs Can Change How We Tell Archaeological Stories","title-short":"Story First, Technology Second","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/story-first-technology-second/BD0A2467A40EF981606D73A3438A13E5","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"romanowska2019","abstract":"Formal models of past human societies informed by archaeological research have a high potential for shaping some of the most topical current debates. Agent-based models, which emphasize how actions by individuals combine to produce global patterns, provide a convenient framework for developing quantitative models of historical social processes. However, being derived from computer science, the method remains largely specialized in archaeology. In this paper and the associated tutorial, we provide a jargon-free introduction to the technique, its potential and limits as well as its diverse applications in archaeology and beyond. We discuss the epistemological rationale of using computational modeling and simulation, classify types of models, and give an overview of the main concepts behind agent-based modeling., Modelos cuantitativos robustos de sociedades humanas en el pasado tienen el potencial de informar los temas de debate actual, particularmente modelos informados por estudios de arqueología.

  {"id":"roosevelt2015","abstract":"This article modifies an old archaeological adage—“excavation is destruction”—to demonstrate how advances in archaeological practice suggest a new iteration: “excavation is digitization.” Digitization, in a fully digital paradigm, refers to practices that leverage advances in onsite, image-based modeling and volumetric recording, integrated databases, and data sharing. Such practices were implemented in 2014 during the inaugural season of the Kaymakçı Archaeological Project (KAP) in western Turkey. The KAP recording system, developed from inception before excavation as a digital workflow, increases accuracy and efficiency as well as simplicity and consistency. The system also encourages both practical and conceptual advances in archaeological practice. These involve benefits associated with thinking volumetrically, rather than in two dimensions, and a connectivity that allows for group decision-making regardless of group location. Additionally, it is hoped that the system's use of almost entirely “off-the-shelf” solutions will encourage its adoption or at least its imitation by other projects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Roosevelt","given":"Christopher H."},{"family":"Cobb","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Moss","given":"Emanuel"},{"family":"Olson","given":"Brandon R."},{"family":"Ünlüsoy","given":"Sinan"}],"citation-key":"roosevelt2015","container-title":"Journal of Field Archaeology","DOI":"10.1179/2042458215Y.0000000004","ISSN":"0093-4690","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,1]]},"page":"325–346","title":"Excavation is Destruction Digitization: Advances in Archaeological Practice","title-short":"Excavation is Destruction Digitization","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/2042458215Y.0000000004","volume":"40"},

Design/methodology/approach ‐ The paper examines the mechanisms of format obsolescence, its historical and current incidence, and identifies attributes of at-risk formats. It examines each step of the current approach asking how effective it would be for these formats. Findings ‐ The current approach assumes format obsolescence is common, happening frequently to most formats. In fact it is rare, happening infrequently to rare formats. The current approach, based on this mis-diagnosis, is ineffective. An alternate approach, based on open source and virtualization, is cheaper and more effective.

Furthermore, this has a basis in the ontology presupposed by economic theory, and is not just an artifact of formalization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ross","given":"Don"}],"citation-key":"ross2008","container-title":"Philosophy of Science","container-title-short":"Philosophy of Science","DOI":"10.1086/594518","ISSN":"0031-8248","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",12,1]]},"page":"732-743","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Ontic Structural Realism and Economics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/594518","volume":"75"},

  {"id":"rouse2015","abstract":"Naturalism as a guiding philosophy for modern science both disavows any appeal to the supernatural or anything else transcendent to nature, and repudiates any philosophical or religious authority over the workings and conclusions of the sciences. A longstanding paradox within naturalism, however, has been the status of scientific knowledge itself, which seems, at first glance, to be something that transcends and is therefore impossible to conceptualize within scientific naturalism itself.             In Articulating the World, Joseph Rouse argues that the most pressing challenge for advocates of naturalism today is precisely this: to understand how to make sense of a scientific conception of nature as itself part of nature, scientifically understood. Drawing upon recent developments in evolutionary biology and the philosophy of science, Rouse defends naturalism in response to this challenge by revising both how we understand our scientific conception of the world and how we situate ourselves within it.","author":[{"family":"Rouse","given":"Joseph"}],"citation-key":"rouse2015","ISBN":"978-0-226-29370-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11,13]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"430","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Articulating the World: Conceptual Understanding and the Scientific Image","title-short":"Articulating the World","type":"book"},
  {"id":"rouse2020","abstract":"The incorporation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) within archaeological survey strategies over the past several years has broadened the geographical scale of inquiry for many projects, led to an increased number of recorded sites and features, and fundamentally shifted interpretive frameworks in many parts of the world. The high-resolution, full-coverage landscape data offered by UAV-based survey would seem well suited to archaeological study in Central Asia; the region is characterized by a long history of fragmented land-use patterns, variegated cultural geography, and niche local environments. However, UAV survey strategies have not been widely incorporated in Central Asian archaeological research, and subsequently have not impacted interpretative processes in ways comparable to other regions. Part of the problem lies in the logistical challenges of operating UAVs in the areas of remote (offline) and rough terrain typical of much of Central Asia, and to this methodological issue we offer some field-tested strategies developed in mountainous areas of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Another significant challenge to UAV-based survey in Central Asia lies in the ongoing development of landscape archaeology as both concept and practice in the region. We address this disciplinary problem by framing our discussion in the broader context of the gains and challenges UAV-generated datasets bring to the interpretation of Central Asian landscapes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Rouse","given":"Lynne M."},{"family":"Krumnow","given":"Jan"}],"citation-key":"rouse2020","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2020.102275","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"102275","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"On the fly: Strategies for UAV-based archaeological survey in mountainous areas of Central Asia and their implications for landscape research","title-short":"On the fly","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X20300663","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"roux2018","abstract":"In this article, we question how new technological traits can penetrate cohesive social groups and spread. Based on ethnographic narratives and following studies in sociology, the hypothesis is that not only weak ties are important for linking otherwise unconnected groups and introducing new techniques but also that expertise is required. In order to test this hypothesis, we carried out a set of field experiments in northern India where the kiln has been adopted recently. Our goal was to measure the degree of expertise of the potters distributed between early and late adopters of the kiln. Our results are discussed in the light of oral interviews. Our conclusions suggest that expertise is a necessary, albeit not sufficient, condition for weak ties to act as bridges and thereby for new techniques to spread. As an example, they explain how turntables could have been adopted by potters from the northern Levant during the third millennium BC.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Roux","given":"Valentine"},{"family":"Bril","given":"Blandine"},{"family":"Karasik","given":"Avshalom"}],"citation-key":"roux2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-018-9397-8","ISSN":"1573-7764","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1024-1050","source":"Springer Link","title":"Weak Ties and Expertise: Crossing Technological Boundaries","title-short":"Weak Ties and Expertise","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-018-9397-8","volume":"25"},

It also provides a presentation of the selected papers. These papers focus not on the ways archaeological data can be represented in a relational format, but on the potential of specific sociological network-related models to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of diffusion processes. The necessity to develop more fine-grained information to reconstruct ancient local social networks is underlined while three aspects of the diffusion process are explored: (a) situations in which cultural practices are not borrowed in spite of contact between groups; (b) situations in which cultural practices are adopted; and (c) situations in which cultural practices in one group are copied by people from another group. All of them take inspiration from sociological studies of diffusion processes through networks, although to different extents.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Roux","given":"Valentine"},{"family":"Manzo","given":"Gianluca"}],"citation-key":"roux2018a","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-018-9395-x","ISSN":"1573-7764","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"967-973","source":"Springer Link","title":"Social Boundaries and Networks in the Diffusion of Innovations: a Short Introduction","title-short":"Social Boundaries and Networks in the Diffusion of Innovations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-018-9395-x","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"rowley2007","abstract":"This paper revisits the data-information-knowledge-wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy by examining the articulation of the hierarchy in a number of widely read textbooks, and analysing their statements about the nature of data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. The hierarchy referred to variously as the ?Knowledge Hierarchy?, the ?Information Hierarchy? and the ?Knowledge Pyramid? is one of the fundamental, widely recognized and ?taken-for-granted? models in the information and knowledge literatures. It is often quoted, or used implicitly, in definitions of data, information and knowledge in the information management, information systems and knowledge management literatures, but there has been limited direct discussion of the hierarchy. After revisiting Ackoff?s original articulation of the hierarchy, definitions of data, information, knowledge and wisdom as articulated in recent textbooks in information systems and knowledge management are reviewed and assessed, in pursuit of a consensus on definitions and transformation processes. This process brings to the surface the extent of agreement and dissent in relation to these definitions, and provides a basis for a discussion as to whether these articulations present an adequate distinction between data, information, and knowledge. Typically information is defined in terms of data, knowledge in terms of information, and wisdom in terms of knowledge, but there is less consensus in the description of the processes that transform elements lower in the hierarchy into those above them, leading to a lack of definitional clarity. In addition, there is limited reference to wisdom in these texts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Rowley","given":"Jennifer"}],"citation-key":"rowley2007","container-title":"Journal of Information Science","DOI":"10.1177/0165551506070706","ISSN":"0165-5515","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"163-180","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The wisdom hierarchy: representations of the DIKW hierarchy","title-short":"The wisdom hierarchy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0165551506070706","volume":"33"},

  {"id":"ruka2019","abstract":"Archaeologists first identified obsidian artifacts in Albania in the early 20th century, but their numbers were small and the contexts insecure. Their source was never determined. Nor was it clear why, given the large numbers of obsidian artifacts recovered in regions to the south and north, in areas like central and southern Greece and Croatia, more obsidian artifacts were not found in Albania. In an attempt to address these problems in Albanian prehistoric archaeology, we analyzed eight obsidian artifacts from six sites – out of a total of only 16 known pieces from the entire country, many of which are now lost – using portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (pXRF). One of these, from the Putanja site, is from Lipari, Italy. The other seven are from Melos, Greece. All eight appear to date from the Middle/Late Neolithic to Late Bronze Age (5500–1050/25 BCE). The absence of obsidian in Albania is not the result of poor archaeological sampling; several, recent intensive surface surveys and excavations in south and north Albania produced no obsidian. Rather, it may be that obsidian was not imported to prehistoric Albania due to the presence of abundant, accessible, very fine flint sources, located in particular in the southwest of the country. Consequently, the prehistoric inhabitants of Albanian were out of the loop or otherwise uninterested in obsidian during those periods of Mediterranean prehistory, specifically from the Late Neolithic to the Bronze Age, when it was traded most extensively.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruka","given":"Rudenc"},{"family":"Galaty","given":"Michael L."},{"family":"Riebe","given":"Danielle J."},{"family":"Tykot","given":"Robert H."},{"family":"Gjipali","given":"Ilir"},{"family":"Kourtessi-Philippakis","given":"Georgia"}],"citation-key":"ruka2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2018.12.014","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"page":"39-49","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"pXRF analysis of obsidian artifacts from Albania: Crossroads or cul-de-sac?","title-short":"pXRF analysis of obsidian artifacts from Albania","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18303262","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"ruppert2013","abstract":"The aim of the article is to intervene in debates about the digital and, in particular, framings that imagine the digital in terms of epochal shifts or as redefining life. Instead, drawing on recent developments in digital methods, we explore the lively, productive and performative qualities of the digital by attending to the specificities of digital devices and how they interact, and sometimes compete, with older devices and their capacity to mobilize and materialize social and other relations. In doing so, our aim is to explore the implications of digital devices and data for reassembling social science methods or what we call the social science apparatuses that assemble digital devices and data to ‘know’ the social and other relations. Building on recent work at CRESC on the social life of methods, we recommend a genealogical approach that is alive to the ways in which digital devices are simultaneously shaped by social worlds, and can in turn become agents that shape those worlds. This calls for attending to the specificities of digital devices themselves, how they are varied and composed of diverse socio-technical arrangements, and are enrolled in the creation of new knowledge spaces, institutions and actors. Rather than exploring what large-scale changes can be revealed and understood through the digital, we argue for explorations of how digital devices themselves are materially implicated in the production and performance of contemporary sociality. To that end we offer the following nine propositions about the implications of digital data and devices and argue that these demand rethinking the theoretical assumptions of social science methods: transactional actors; heterogeneity; visualization; continuous time; whole populations; granularity; expertise; mobile and mobilizing; and non-coherence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruppert","given":"Evelyn"},{"family":"Law","given":"John"},{"family":"Savage","given":"Mike"}],"citation-key":"ruppert2013","container-title":"Theory, Culture & Society","container-title-short":"Theory, Culture & Society","DOI":"10.1177/0263276413484941","ISSN":"0263-2764","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"22-46","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Reassembling Social Science Methods: The Challenge of Digital Devices","title-short":"Reassembling Social Science Methods","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0263276413484941","volume":"30"},
  {"id":"ruser2024","abstract":"It is increasingly common to conceive of scientific research as something that can be planned, managed, and assessed by applying modern techniques of project management. Expecting research to follow certain standardized procedures to achieve clearly defined goals has a long tradition, in particular, in the natural sciences and has arguably contributed to the acceptance of science as an authoritative force that makes tangible contributions to social progress. For the social sciences, however such a narrow understanding of scientific research causes serious problems. Social science research doesn’t always fit in the logic of project management. Moreover, attempts to adjust research practices to correspond with external, managerial experiences are far more consequential and damaging to the social sciences.  This article interrogates the prospects and consequences of project thinking in the social sciences and discusses the likely epistemological consequences. To do so, it will recapitulate the historical and social developments that lead to the adoption of managerial principles in social science research and contrasts them with the philosophical principles that underpinned the scientification of thinking about the social.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruser","given":"Alexander"}],"citation-key":"ruser2024","container-title":"Epistemology & Philosophy of Science","DOI":"10.5840/eps202461233","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,13]]},"language":"en","page":"190-208","source":"www.pdcnet.org","title":"Social Science as a Project: Epistemological Consequence of Changing Contexts for Social Science Research","title-short":"Social Science as a Project","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&fp=eps&id=eps_2024_0061_0002_0190_0208","volume":"61"},
  {"id":"russell2015","abstract":"Past researchers have identified individual styles of painting in Mimbres Black-on-white bowls, leading Steven LeBlanc to recently call for the development of quantitative methods to enable and assess such identifications. We propose such a methodology here. Through a process of pair-wise, micro-stylistic comparisons, bowls painted by a single artist or group of closely cooperating artists are analytically linked in chain-like fashion. Two bowls are attributed to the “same hands” if their similarity measure is at or above 70 percent. Similarity measures are determined by comparing minute details that reflect artistic decisions. The method takes into account diachronic development of artistic skill, subject matter diversity, and the transfer of style across generations. Results can contribute to an understanding of stylistic development, craft specialization, and the role of artists in traditional societies.\n, \nInvestigadores anteriores han identificado estilos individuales de pintura en cajetes Mimbres Negro-sobre-blanco (Mimbres Black-on-white), llevando recientemente a Steven LeBlanc a exhortar el desarrollo de métodos cuantitativos para permitir y evaluar dichas identificaciones. Proponemos un ejemplo de dicha metodología en este trabajo. Por medio de un proceso de comparaciones micro-estilísticas por pares, los cajetes pintados por un solo artista o un grupo de artistas cooperando cercanamente se vinculan analíticamente de una manera en cadena. Dos cajetes se consideran como pintados con “las mismas manos” si su medida de similitud se encuentra en o arriba del 70 por ciento. Las medidas de similitud se determinan comparando detalles diminutos que reflejen las decisiones artísticas. El método toma en cuenta el desarrollo diacrónico de las habilidades del artista, la diversidad del tema y la transferencia del estilo a través de generaciones. Los resultados pueden contribuir a entender el desarrollo estilístico, la especialización artesanal y el papel de los artistas en sociedades tradicionales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Russell","given":"Will G."},{"family":"Hegmon","given":"Michelle"}],"citation-key":"russell2015","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.7183/2326-3768.3.4.358","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11]]},"language":"en","page":"358-377","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Identifying Mimbres Artists: A Quantitative Approach","title-short":"Identifying Mimbres Artists","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/identifying-mimbres-artists/FD965F23C56B18366C18FE8CB253A854","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"sabik2021","abstract":"Feminist psychologists have called for researchers to consider the social and historical context and the multidimensionality of participants in research studies. The Reproducibility Project documents the degree to which the findings from mainstream psychological studies are reproduced. Drawing on intersectionality theory, we question the value of reproducing findings while ignoring who is represented, intersecting social and group identities, sociohistorical context, and the power and privilege that likely influence participants’ responses in psychology experiments. To critically examine the Reproducibility Project in psychology, we analyzed the 100 replication reports produced between 2011 and 2014 (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). We developed an intersectional analytic framework to investigate (a) representation, (b) whether demographic and identity factors were considered through a multidimensional or intersectional lens, (c) explanations of non-replication, and (d) whether socio-cultural context was considered. Results show that reports predominantly include WEIRD samples (people from Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic countries). Context and identity were rarely considered, even when study design relied on these factors, and intersectional identities and structures (considering power, structural issues, discrimination, and historical context) were absent from nearly all reports.

This chapter discusses the turn-taking system for conversation. On the basis of research using audio recordings of naturally occurring conversations, the chapter highlights the organization of turn taking for conversation and extracts some of the interest that organization has. The turn-taking system for conversation can be described in terms of two components and a set of rules. These two components are turn-constructional component and turn-constructional component. Turn-allocational techniques are distributed into two groups: (1) those in which next turn is allocated by current speaker selecting a next speaker and (2) those in which next turn is allocated by self-selection. The turn-taking rule-set provides for the localization of gap and overlap possibilities at transition-relevance places and their immediate environment, cleansing the rest of a turn's space of systematic bases for their possibility.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Sacks","given":"Harvey"},{"family":"Schegloff","given":"Emanuel A."},{"family":"Jefferson","given":"Gail"}],"citation-key":"sacks1974","container-title":"Language","DOI":"10.1016/B978-0-12-623550-0.50008-2","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1974"]]},"page":"696-735","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A Simplest Systematics for the Organization of Turn Taking for Conversation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780126235500500082","volume":"50"},
  {"id":"safadi2019","abstract":"Time has consistently been regarded as the missing dimension from our renderings of space, having a significant impact on how we interpret and represent past interaction. Nowhere is this more keenly felt than in discussion of maritime mobility. This paper outlines an innovative approach to mapping maritime spaces by taking into account the performance of Bronze Age sailing ships in different weather conditions and the subsequent time of sailing journeys. The use of cartograms is demonstrated to be invaluable for reconceptualisation of maritime space and rethinking maritime connectivity in the past. This marks a step-change in approach, which has implications for regions beyond the case study area (eastern Mediterranean). The results presented in this paper foreground meaningful differences in maritime connectivity between Egypt and the Levant during the earlier Bronze Age than are easily realised through traditional static representations. This demonstrates the significance of developing alternative representations of space/time for archaeology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Safadi","given":"Crystal"},{"family":"Sturt","given":"Fraser"}],"citation-key":"safadi2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2019.01.001","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,1]]},"page":"1-15","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The warped sea of sailing: Maritime topographies of space and time for the Bronze Age eastern Mediterranean","title-short":"The warped sea of sailing","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440318304333","volume":"103"},

For example, their exhortation to ‘see the human–environment relationship as always already sociocultural’ (p. 8) should be firmly established by now, but I agree with their assertion that this perspective ‘seems underdeveloped in archaeology’ (p. 8) and that looking to anthropology is one especially productive route for developing such a sensibility.

  {"id":"sandoval2021","abstract":"In recent decades, it has been frequently asserted that the standardization of recording methods for archaeological excavation has compromised the quality of site records because interpretative information is minimal, and it is diﬃcult to assess its security due to the absence of a reﬂexive background. For many archaeologists, single-context recording is the perfect example of such problems in ﬁeld recording. But this claim is controversial, as it is inconsistent with archaeological interpretative theory that states that ﬁeld interpretation and data quality depend on various epistemic circumstances, such as the skill of ﬁeldworkers, the background knowledge of a site, and the character of remains. By taking an example of a commercial excavation in London, this paper will show the extent to which standardization and other epistemic factors determine the process of ﬁeld recording.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Sandoval","given":"Gustavo"}],"citation-key":"sandoval2021","container-title":"Journal of Field Archaeology","container-title-short":"Journal of Field Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00934690.2021.1926700","ISSN":"0093-4690, 2042-4582","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,3]]},"language":"en","page":"496-512","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Single-Context Recording, Field Interpretation and Reflexivity: An Analysis of Primary Data In Context Sheets","title-short":"Single-Context Recording, Field Interpretation and Reflexivity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00934690.2021.1926700","volume":"46"},

The term tangible artifact is used broadly here and can include artifacts produced using various mediums. The guiding questions are: 1) How can the process of making challenge us to be more self-reflective and critical about the research we are conducting? 2) Can making add a dimension of tangibility to research that is distinct from other research activities? 3) How can reflecting on making and telling stories about the making process illuminate and stimulate learning and assist in research conceptualization?","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Santoso","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Hassman","given":"Katie DeVries"},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Rosner","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Erickson","given":"Ingrid"},{"family":"Ratto","given":"Matt"}],"citation-key":"santoso2014","DOI":"10.9776/14212","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,1]]},"language":"english","license":"Copyright 2014 is held by the authors of individual items in the proceedings.

  {"id":"sapirstein2021","abstract":"As 3D scanning and photogrammetry are supplanting traditional illustration techniques with increasing speed, archaeologists and architectural historians have sounded alarms about what stands to be lost if hand drawing is altogether eliminated from fieldwork. This paper argues that the most direct threat is to a particular form of archaeological illustration which does not necessarily share the advantages attributed to other kinds of drawing. Recording by means of “technical drawing” communicates a collectively agreed interpretation of the ancient record, and its primary benefit is not stimulating creative thought but rather enhancing human observation. A review of two cases comparing the illustration of ancient Greek architecture through analogue and digital methods indicates that, in practice, both approaches draw attention away from the ancient subject and focus it on distracting protocols for the great majority of the time spent in the field. Even so, technical drawing requires protracted, in-person scrutiny of the subject, whereas 3D technologies pose a genuine risk of altogether eliminating meaningful human interpretation from the recording process. The greater efficiencies of digital techniques suggest a path forward, as time once allocated to tedious stages of technical drawing might be applied toward more thoughtful interpretive tasks. However, such measures must be deliberately integrated into a digital research program through planning around the very different cadences of the digital process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Sapirstein","given":"Philip"}],"citation-key":"sapirstein2021","container-title":"Studies in Digital Heritage","container-title-short":"SDH","DOI":"10.14434/sdh.v4i2.31520","ISSN":"2574-1748","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,10]]},"page":"134-159","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Human versus computer vision in archaeological recording","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/sdh/article/view/31520","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"saunders2022a","abstract":"The most pressing problems in science are neither empirical nor theoretical, but infrastructural. Scientific practice is defined by coproductive, mutually reinforcing infrastructural deficits and incentive systems that everywhere constrain and contort our art of curiosity in service of profit and prestige. Our infrastructural problems are not unique to science, but reflective of the broader logic of digital enclosure where platformatized control of information production and extraction fuels some of the largest corporations in the world. I have taken lessons learned from decades of intertwined digital cultures within and beyond academia like wikis, pirates, and librarians in order to draft a path towards more liberatory infrastructures for both science and society. Based on a system of peer-to-peer linked data, I sketch interoperable systems for shared data, tools, and knowledge that map onto three domains of platform capture: storage, computation and communication. The challenge of infrastructure is not solely technical, but also social and cultural, and so I attempt to ground a practical development blueprint in an ethics for organizing and maintaining it. I intend this draft as a rallying call for organization, to be revised with the input of collaborators and through the challenges posed by its implementation. I argue that a more liberatory future for science is neither utopian nor impractical -- the truly impractical choice is to continue to organize science as prestige fiefdoms resting on a pyramid scheme of underpaid labor, playing out the clock as every part of our work is swallowed whole by circling information conglomerates. It was arguably scientists looking for a better way to communicate that created something as radical as the internet in the first place, and I believe we can do it again.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Saunders","given":"Jonny L."}],"citation-key":"saunders2022a","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2209.07493","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Share Alike 4.0 International","publisher":"arXiv","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Decentralized Infrastructure for (Neuro)science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07493","version":"1"},

  {"id":"schiffer1983","abstract":"Research in experimental archaeology, ethnoarchaeology, geoarchaeology, and vertebrate taphonomy has appreciably increased our general understanding of the formation processes—cultural and natural—of archaeological sites. In synthesizing some of these recent advances, this paper focuses on the traces of artifacts and characteristics of deposits that can be used to identify the formation processes of specific deposits. These observational phenomena are grouped into three basic categories that structure the presentation: (1) simple properties of artifacts, (2) complex properties of artifacts, and (3) other properties of deposits. Also considered is the way in which prior knowledge can help the archaeologist to cope with the large number of processes and the nearly infinite combination of them that may have contributed to the specific deposits of interest. Several analytical strategies are proposed: (1) hypothesis testing, (2) multivariate analysis, and (3) use of published data to evaluate formation processes. This paper demonstrates that the identification of formation processes, which must precede behavioral inference and be accomplished by any research endeavor that uses evidence from the archaeological record, can become practical and routine.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Schiffer","given":"Michael B."}],"citation-key":"schiffer1983","container-title":"American Antiquity","DOI":"10.2307/279771","ISSN":"0002-7316, 2325-5064","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1983",10]]},"page":"675-706","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Toward the Identification of Formation Processes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/div-classtitletoward-the-identification-of-formation-processesdiv/9B745F18A337FA1F3E130A0760237FDB","volume":"48"},
  {"id":"schiffer1988","abstract":"Contradictory programmatic statements have increased uncertainty about the nature and roles of theory in archaeology. However, a framework can be constructed that ties together diverse kinds of theory that archaeologists use-and often create. Three overarching realms of theory can be recognized, each consisting of one or more functionally defined domains: social theory, reconstruction theory (the domains are material-culture dynamics and cultural and noncultural formation processes of the archaeological record), and methodological theory (the domains are recovery, analysis, and inference). Within each domain are high-level, mid-level, and low-level theories. Previous investigators often have overlooked the richness and complexity of archaeological theory, sometimes generalizing from a very narrow perspective.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Schiffer","given":"Michael B."}],"citation-key":"schiffer1988","container-title":"American Antiquity","container-title-short":"Am. antiq.","DOI":"10.2307/281212","ISSN":"0002-7316, 2325-5064","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1988",7]]},"language":"en","page":"461-485","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Structure of Archaeological Theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0002731600071146/type/journal_article","volume":"53"},

  {"id":"schillinger2016","abstract":"Spatio-temporal patterns of artifactual variation are increasingly being studied via the explicit application of cultural evolutionary theory and methods. Such broad-scale (macroevolutionary) patterns are mediated, however, by a series of small-scale (microevolutionary) processes that occur at the level of individual artifacts, and individual artifact users and producers. Within experimental biology, “model organisms” have played a crucial role in understanding the role of fundamental microevolutionary processes, such as mutation and the inheritance of variation, in respect to macroevolutionary patterns. There has, however, been little equivalent laboratory work to better understand how microevolutionary processes influence macroevolutionary patterns in artifacts and their analysis. Here, we adopt a “model artifact” approach to experimentally study the issues of copy error (mutation) and resultant phylogenetic signal in artifact traditions. We used morphometric procedures to examine shape copying error rates in our “model artifacts.” We first established experimentally that statistically different rates of copying error (mutation) could be induced when participants used two different types of shaping tool to produce copies of foam “artifacts.” Using this as a baseline, we then tested whether these differing mutation rates led to differing phylogenetic signal and accuracy in two separate experimental transmission chains (lineages), involving participants copying the previous participant's artifact. The analysis demonstrated that phylogenetic reconstruction is more accurate in artifactual lineages where copying error is demonstrably lower. Such results demonstrate how fidelity of transmission impacts directly on the evolution of technological traditions and their empirical analysis. In particular, these results highlight that differing contexts of cultural transmission relating to fidelity might lead to differing patterns of resolution within reconstructed evolutionary sequences. Overall, these analyses demonstrate the importance of a “model artifact” approach in discussions of cultural evolution, equivalent in importance to the use of model organisms in evolutionary biology in order to better understand fundamental microevolutionary processes of direct relevance to macroevolutionary archaeological patterns.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Schillinger","given":"Kerstin"},{"family":"Mesoudi","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Lycett","given":"Stephen J."}],"citation-key":"schillinger2016","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2016.04.013","ISSN":"0305-4403","issue":"Supplement C","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",6,1]]},"page":"23-34","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Copying error, evolution, and phylogenetic signal in artifactual traditions: An experimental approach using “model artifacts”","title-short":"Copying error, evolution, and phylogenetic signal in artifactual traditions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030544031630022X","volume":"70"},
  {"id":"schillinger2017","abstract":"A relationship between behavioral variability and artifactual variability is a founding principle of archaeology. However, this relationship is surprisingly not well studied empirically from an explicitly “microevolutionary” perspective. Here, we experimentally simulated artifactual variation in two populations of “artifact” manufacturers, involving only a single behavioral difference in terms of their “tradition” of manufacturing tool. We then statistically analyzed shape variation in the resultant artifacts. In many respects, patterned differences might not have been expected to emerge given the simple nature of the task, the fact that only a single behavioral variable differed in our two populations, and all participants copied the same target artifact. However, multivariate analyses identified significant differences between the two “assemblages.” These results have several implications for our understanding and theoretical conceptualization of the relationship between behavior and artifactual variability, including the analytical potency of conceiving of artifacts as the product of behavioral “recipes” comprised of individual “ingredient” behavioral properties. Indeed, quite trivial behavioral differences, in generating microevolutionarily potent variability, can thus have long-term consequences for artifactual changes measured over time and space. Moreover, measurable “cultural” differences in artifacts can emerge not necessarily only because of a strict “mental template” but as the result of subtle differences in behavioral ingredients that are socially learned at the community level.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Schillinger","given":"Kerstin"},{"family":"Mesoudi","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Lycett","given":"Stephen J."}],"citation-key":"schillinger2017","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-016-9280-4","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"640-658","source":"link-springer-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca","title":"Differences in Manufacturing Traditions and Assemblage-Level Patterns: the Origins of Cultural Differences in Archaeological Data","title-short":"Differences in Manufacturing Traditions and Assemblage-Level Patterns","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-016-9280-4","volume":"24"},

Current cultural resources laws and policies focus largely on the physical characteristics of individual sites and features. I call here for a management approach that differs from current practice in several important ways. First, it recognizes the power of landscapes and landscape character. Drawing from both wilderness and park management, it calls for the identification and preservation of landscape characteristics, and the development of landscape-level inventories that can identify current landscape condition. Finally, it recognizes that how a landscape is experienced by its constituencies and advocates is a measure of management effectiveness. For management to succeed, management approaches must recognize and respect the core values and experiences that are at the heart of culturally significant landscapes.\n, \nLos paisajes culturalmente significativos, que evocan y promueven fuertes sentimientos de identificacíon entre sus constituyentes y defensores, crean un desafío de gestión para las agencias federales.

  {"id":"schmader2016","abstract":"Archaeological site management goals, when informed by the input of traditional communities, can result in very different outcomes than standard cultural resource investigation strategies. A case example is presented for a large site in Albuquerque, New Mexico, containing material from the Francisco Vázquez de Coronado expedition. From 1540 to 1542, Coronado led one of the largest and most well-known explorations of the American southwest. The expedition spent much time in the Rio Grande Valley near present-day Albuquerque, including the site of Piedras Marcadas Pueblo. Formal consultations between local tribes and the City of Albuquerque in the 1990s generated a research program using geophysics and non-invasive techniques. Geophysical investigation produced results that would not have been obtained without tribal consultation to guide the research from an early point. By combining architectural data found by resistivity surveys with artifact distributions found by metal detection, details of a battle between Coronado’s expedition and puebloan people have emerged. Ongoing tribal consultation has shed light on the events that occurred at Piedras Marcadas and continues to inform interpretation and site management decisions. Resulting cooperation between traditional communities and the City of Albuquerque is a case study in the ever-important practices of co-creation and collaborative archaeology.\n, \nObjetivos de manejo del sitio, cuando informados por la contribución de las comunidades tradicionales, pueden tener resultados muy diferentes que cuando se usa las estrategias estándares de la investigación de recursos culturales.

De 1540 a 1542, Coronado dirigió una de las exploraciones más grandes y más conocidas del suroeste de los Estados Unidos Americanos. La expedición pasó mucho tiempo en el valle del Río Grande cerca de la ciudad que actualmente es Albuquerque, incluyendo el sitio de “Piedras Marcadas Pueblo.” Consultas formales entre los tribus locales y el gobierno de la ciudad de Albuquerque en la década de 1990 generaron un programa de investigación que utiliza la geofísica y las técnicas no-invasivas. La investigación geofísica produjo resultados que no se habrían obtenido sin la consulta tribal para guiar la investigación desde los momentos principales. Al combinar los datos arquitectónicos encontrados por los estudios de resistividad con las distribuciones de artefactos encontrados por detección de metales, se han surgido detalles de una batalla entre la expedición de Coronado y la gente “Pueblo.” Consulta continua con las poblaciones indígenas ha arrojado luz sobre los hechos ocurridos en Piedras Marcadas, y continúa de informar sobre las decisiones de interpretación y manejo del sitio.

  {"id":"schneider2021","abstract":"With this commentary we respond to Olof Hallonsten’s recent plea to stop evaluating science. In particular, we challenge two central premises of Hallonsten’s argument, regarding both the scope of his argument and the claim that ‘exogenous’ metric evaluation of science on its own explains failures of the current scientific enterprise to produce certified knowledge. Even though we acknowledge that ‘external’ evaluation mechanisms of science likely amplify problematic practices within science, they do not suffice to explain the crisis situation sketched out by Hallonsten and others. Instead, we make a plea to the academic community to introspect on its own practices. We argue that, to an overwhelmingly degree, these research practices shape the reward and quality assurance system of science. Discussing the formal and informal quality assurance mechanisms of science, we conclude that the apparent crisis in science is cultural and organizational, deeply internally rooted, and inseparable from researchers’ daily practices and personal responsibility. Most importantly, this concerns the central role of the academic community in controlling and evaluating how science is practiced, how merit is defined, and how decisions of promotion and rewards are made.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Schneider","given":"Jesper W."},{"family":"Horbach","given":"Serge P.

  {"id":"schneider2024","abstract":"Questionable research practices (QRP) are believed to be widespread, but empirical assessments are generally restricted to a few types of practices. Furthermore, conceptual confusion is rife with use and prevalence of QRPs often being confused as the same quantity. We present the hitherto most comprehensive study examining QRPs across scholarly fields and knowledge production modes. We survey perception, use, prevalence and predictors of QRPs among 3,402 researchers in Denmark and 1,307 in the UK, USA, Croatia and Austria. Results reveal remarkably similar response patterns among Danish and international respondents (τ = 0.85). Self-reported use indicates whether respondents have used a QRP in recent publications. 9 out of 10 respondents admitted using at least one QRP. Median use is three out of nine QRP items. Self-reported prevalence reflects the frequency of use. On average, prevalence rates were roughly three times lower compared to self-reported use. Findings indicated that the perceived social acceptability of QRPs influenced self-report patterns. Results suggest that most researchers use different types of QRPs within a restricted time period. The prevalence estimates, however, do not suggest outright systematic use of specific QRPs. Perceived pressure was the strongest systemic predictor for prevalence. Conversely, more local attention to research cultures and academic age was negatively related to prevalence. Finally, the personality traits conscientiousness and, to a lesser degree, agreeableness were also inversely associated with self-reported prevalence. Findings suggest that explanations for engagement with QRPs are not only attributable to systemic factors, as hitherto suggested, but a complicated mixture of experience, systemic and individual factors, and motivated reasoning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Schneider","given":"Jesper W."},{"family":"Allum","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Andersen","given":"Jens Peter"},{"family":"Petersen","given":"Michael Bang"},{"family":"Madsen","given":"Emil B."},{"family":"Mejlgaard","given":"Niels"},{"family":"Zachariae","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"schneider2024","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0304342","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,12]]},"language":"en","page":"e0304342","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Is something rotten in the state of Denmark?

That is why archaeologists still excavate, generating data, and publishing in the latest issues of long-established journals or in expensive monographs that only other archaeologists will read. Archaeologists employed by heritage agencies care for monuments and historic buildings, ensuring they survive, ‘for the benefit of future generations’. For many, this is how archaeology should remain. A similar cultural conservatism lingered in the UK from the end of the Second World War until, arguably, 26 November 1976 when, according to musician Phil Oakey, the Second World War finally came to an end. That was the day punk arrived with the thrashing of guitars and streams of abuse. But punk was about more than just the music. It was an ethos, a philosophy. Conventions were challenged and the old order gradually dismantled. Pre-1976 news footage now has the semblance of ancient history. This semi-autobiographical introduction to a collection of essays that promotes new thinking on counter-archaeologies wonders if that punk ethos could not have similar benefits for archaeology.

  {"id":"schofield2020","abstract":"A 2019 geophysical survey of part of the 8.55-ha Freston interrupted ditch system (Suffolk), which integrated reconnaissance fluxgate gradiometry with earth resistance metre techniques, produced a fine-grained geo-spatial resolution site plan to undertake a pilot-study research excavation. The features targeted comprised four ditch termini of the enclosure, with the aim being to test the long-established hypothesis that the monument represented an Early Neolithic causewayed enclosure. Although the geophysical survey successfully located the ditch termini and linear trends indicative of the internal palisade trench, the magnetic data in particular further suggested the presence of numerous pit-like anomalies both within and outside of the enclosure. The combined survey data also detailed for the first time an approximately 70-m-long curvilinear low-resistance ditch-like anomaly that appears to precede the interrupted ditch system. The working hypothesis is that this represents a ditch flanking a long barrow, a type of communal Early Neolithic mortuary monument that typically predate the construction of causewayed enclosures across southern Britain. The subsequent 6-week excavation achieved its aims by recovering diagnostic Early Neolithic (earlier 4th millennium cal BC) material culture from the ditch fills.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Schofield","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Carter","given":"Tristan"},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Nathaniel"},{"family":"Moir","given":"Rose"}],"citation-key":"schofield2020","container-title":"Archaeological Prospection","DOI":"10.1002/arp.1800","ISSN":"1099-0763","issue":"n/a","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Integrating geophysical survey and excavation at the Freston Early Neolithic causewayed enclosure, Suffolk (UK)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/arp.1800","volume":"n/a"},

  {"id":"seifried2019","abstract":"Due to the proliferation of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software and the improvement of graphic user interfaces, least-cost analysis has become one of the most common tools in archaeological research for modelling movement across past landscapes. While more complex techniques and algorithms have been developed to address the theoretical limitations of least-cost analysis, many of these are not readily accessible to typical GIS users, due to either hardware limitations or a lack of in-depth training in the theory and methods of spatial analysis. Seeking a middle ground, we test a number of simple modifications to basic least-cost analysis using the Mani peninsula in southern Greece as a case study. We assess eight procedures for calculating least-cost paths (LCPs), defining cost based on a combination of slope and the location of pre-modern pathways. These procedures are used to generate LCPs for a well-documented journey made by Colonel William Martin Leake in the year 1805. Comparing the LCPs against Leake's detailed notes and “low-cost corridors,” we visually assess the reliability of each model and identify likely alternative routes. We conclude that a simple modification to basic least-cost analysis – incorporating a time-based algorithm along with traces of pre-modern footpaths and roads – can produce robust, reliable least-cost models in other archaeological contexts where traces of pre-modern pathways can still be detected.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Seifried","given":"Rebecca M."},{"family":"Gardner","given":"Chelsea A.

With the permission of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, 3D documentation of Caddo funerary vessels from the Vanderpool site (41SM77) was conducted with the initial goal of ensuring that these data would be publicly available for future research long after the vessels were repatriated. A digital infrastructure was created to archive and disseminate the resultant 3D datasets, ensuring that they would be accessible by both researchers and the general public (CRHR 2014a). However, 3D imagery can be used for much more than documentation. To illustrate this, these data were utilized in a 3D morphometric analysis of the intact and reconstructed vessels to explore the range of variation that occurs in ceramic vessel shape and its potential contribution to the local ceramic taxonomy. Results of the 3D morphometric analysis demonstrate the potential for substantive analytical gains in discussions of temporal resolution and ceramic technological organization in the ancestral Caddo region.\n, \nEl escaneado tridimensional (3D) de materiales arqueológicos se utiliza normalmente como una herramienta para documentar artefactos.

  {"id":"selden2021","abstract":"The production of three-dimensional (3D) digital meshes of surface and computed tomographic (CT) data has become widespread in morphometric analyses of anthropological and archaeological data. Given that processing methods are not standardized, this leaves questions regarding the comparability of processed and digitally curated 3D datasets. The goal of this study was to identify those processing parameters that result in the most consistent fit between CT-derived meshes and a 3D surface model of the same human mandible. Eight meshes, each using unique thresholding and smoothing parameters, were compared to assess whole-object deviations, deviations along curves, and deviations between specific anatomical features on the surface model when compared with the CT scans using a suite of comparison points. Based on calculated gap distances, the mesh that thresholded at “0” with an applied smoothing technique was found to deviate least from the surface model, although it is not the most biologically accurate. Results have implications for aggregated studies that employ multimodal 3D datasets, and caution is recommended for studies that enlist 3D data from websites and digital repositories, particularly if processing parameters are unknown or derived for studies with different research foci.\n, \nLa producción de mallas digitales tridimensionales (3D) de superficie e información tomográfica computarizada (TC) se ha generalizado en los analisis morfométricos de datos antropológicos y arqueológicos.

Con base en las distancias de separación calculadas, aunque no las más precisas desde el punto de vista biológico, se encontró que la malla con umbral en “0” con una técnica de suavizado aplicada se desvía menos de la superficie modelo. Los resultados tienen implicaciones para los estudios agregados que emplean conjuntos de datos 3D multimodales y se recomienda precaución para los estudios que incluyen datos 3D de sitios web y repositorios digitales, especialmente si los parámetros de procesamiento son desconocidos o derivados de estudios con diferentes focos de investigación.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Selden","given":"Robert Z."},{"family":"Butaric","given":"Lauren N."},{"family":"Bergstrom","given":"Kersten"},{"family":"Gerven","given":"Dennis Van"}],"citation-key":"selden2021","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2021.18","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11]]},"language":"en","page":"325-337","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Considerations for Post-processing Parameters in Mixed-Method 3D Analyses: A Mesolithic Mandibular Case Study","title-short":"Considerations for Post-processing Parameters in Mixed-Method 3D Analyses","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/abs/considerations-for-postprocessing-parameters-in-mixedmethod-3d-analyses/24A53D0C0C19A11CD74C881C45EB2AE3","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"semerari2017","abstract":"The impact of connectivity in past societies has long been a focus of archaeological studies. Well-established approaches have been developed over the years to understand emergent connections and entanglement between distant communities, including world system, culture contact, post-colonial theories and network analyses. Our understanding of connectivity remains partial, however, because researchers have focussed on the establishment and consequences of contact and largely ignored the dynamics that often led to its interruption. Yet these processes of ‘disentanglement’ are just as complex and far-reaching as their converse and need to be understood in their own right. This paper shows that a thorough analysis of disentanglement processes can contribute to our understanding of the very nature of the interrupted contacts, as well as shed light on the social dynamics that engender long-term changes in contact patterns. The concept of disentanglement is discussed in the light of current theories of connectivity and explored through regional case studies in Late Bronze Age Italy (Salento) and Greece (Achaea).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Semerari","given":"Giulia Saltini"}],"citation-key":"semerari2017","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-016-9277-z","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"542-578","source":"link-springer-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca","title":"Towards an Archaeology of Disentanglement","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-016-9277-z","volume":"24"},

This informs the accurate representation of uncertainty in existing estimators of number of individuals, such as Most Likely Number of Individuals (MLNI). Calculations based on elements that have dependent recovery probability will underestimate uncertainty. Appendicular skeletal inventories were collected from three forensic and three archaeological samples of individuated remains (N = 201). Analyses were performed in R on a distance matrix derived from correlation of 18 left and right skeletal elements. The effect of dependent element types and dependent antimeres on MLNI estimation was tested via simulation from a multivariate normal distribution with an initial population size of 100, 3 element types, and a 50% recovery rate. Hierarchical clustering showed a consistent division between the upper and lower extremities. The clavicle showed potential association of antimeres and buried remains showed a positive correlation between recovery rate and recovery relatedness. According to simulations, element type dependence increases MLNI variability without a corresponding increase in Highest Probability Density Region (HPD) width, resulting in reduced HPD accuracy. Antimere dependence causes a rapid decline in MLNI values, reducing HPD accuracy five times faster than type dependence. When calculating MLNI, avoidance of highly dependent antimeres should be prioritized. The analyst should then select taphonomically robust elements from both the upper and lower extremities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Sgheiza","given":"Valerie"}],"citation-key":"sgheiza2021","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2021.102796","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"102796","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Skeletal element independence and implications for quantification","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X21000080","volume":"35"},

  {"id":"shanks1996","abstract":"The idea of archaeology as craft challenges the separation of reasoning and execution that characterizes the field today. The Arts and Crafts Movement of the late nineteenth century established craftwork as an aesthetic of opposition. We establish craft in a Marxian critique of alienated labor, and we propose a unified practice of hand, heart, and mind for archaeology. The debates engendered by postprocessual archaeology have firmly situated archaeology in the present as a cultural and political practice. Many, however, still do not know how to work with these ideas. We argue that a resolution to this dilemma lies in thinking of archaeology as a craft. This resolution does not provide a method, or a cookbook, for the practice of archaeology, as indeed the core of our argument is that attempts at such standardization lie at the heart of the alienation of archaeology. Rather, we wish to consider archaeology as a mode of cultural productión, a unified method practiced by archaeologist, “client” public, and contemporary society.\n, \nResumen\nLa idea de la arqueología como arte desafia la separatión de razonamiento y ejecución, teoría y práctica que hoy caracteriza a la disciplina.

  {"id":"shanks2010","abstract":"Archaeology abounds in visual media, both media artifacts from the past, as well as means of documenting and studying those artifacts. Classic and long-established approaches to visual media include iconography and iconology (semantics and the identification of visual content), semiotics (the systems and structures of communication, signification and meaning), as well as graphics, cartography, planning and charting (communicative efficacy, the geometry of 2D to 3D translation, and information compression.\n\nWe shift emphasis in this paper away from communication, iconology, and visuality per se, the content and structure of imagery, toward the way visuality works in archaeology, from visual media as material forms (graphics, maps, photographs) to the work that visual media perform in archaeology. Along the way we present a criticism of\nthe stress placed in much discussion of visual media on their representational qualities, that is, their fidelity to what they are taken to represent, to their mimetic qualities and their degree of correspondence to what is represented.\n\nIt is not that we consider such inquiry to be wrong, but rather that communication and meaning are often secondary functions of media. Ironically, what often matters most\nabout visual media, we would claim, is not what they represent, but the way they fit into archaeological work on the remains of the past. In this development of McLuhan’s old adage that it is the medium that matters, we focus attention on practice and discourse, drawing particularly on the field of science and technology studies (STS).\nThis emphasis upon the way images work is why we term our interest one in the political economy of visual media—recovering the work done by visual media in archaeology through networks of production, distribution and consumption. This leads us to identify some of the implications of new digital media, not for more spectacular\nsummations of data about the past or photorealistic simulations, but as open fora for the co-production of pasts that matter now and for visions of futur","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Shanks","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"shanks2010","container-title":"http://eureka.sbs.ox.ac.uk/328","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"source":"ora.ox.ac.uk","title":"A Political Economy of Visual Media in Archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:e5b1a58c-ad26-4756-9609-96e3c9a19526"},

To follow the history of the “hard–soft” distinction is to open a window on changing sensibilities about what science is, what values are attached to it, and what it is for. I conclude with speculations about more recent changes in the value-schemes implicated in the “hard” and the “soft” and about pertinent changes in the place of the “soft” human sciences in governance and production.

  {"id":"sharp2014","abstract":"While tablet devices are becoming commonplace in archaeological research, the transfer of data for analysis is a matter of critical concern. As geographic information systems (GIS) are increasingly incorporated into our archaeological research, there is a need not only to streamline data acquisition, but also to collect data that can be used in conjunction with high-level spatial analytical tools, such as those available in ESRI’s ArcGIS. During a short lab season, various methods of paper-free data collection and cross-platform transfer using these user-friendly devices were tested. It was found that both iPad and Android-based systems present great advantages in terms of portability and electronic data acquisition. However, file compatibility and transfer of data across multiple platforms present a number of important drawbacks. The present case study focuses on the development of a data collection protocol implemented by the Proyecto de Investigación Arqueológica Zaña Valley (PIAZ), Peru, that moves beyond these limitations. The ultimate incorporation of data collected using tablet devices demonstrates the potential for this tool in archaeological research, along with the pitfalls for projects that rely heavily on GIS. Significant findings regarding the advantages, as well as the limitations, of e-data collection, transfer, and storage are discussed.\n, \nAunque las tabletas digitales se están volviendo más comunes en la investigación arqueológica, la transferencia de datos para su análisis es un asunto crítico.

Durante una corta temporada de laboratorio, se pusieron a prueba distintos métodos libres de uso de papel para la recolección de datos y para su transferencia a través de distintas plataformas utilizando estos dispositivos fácilmente de usarse. Con base en esto, se encontró que los sistemas para iPad y Android presentan grandes ventajas en términos de portabilidad y de la adquisición de datos electrónicos.

El siguiente estudio de caso se enfoca en el desarrollo de un protocolo para la recoloección de datos, implementado por el Proyecto de Investigación Arqueológica Valle de Zaña, Perú (PIAZ), que trasciende estas limitaciones. La más reciente incorporación de datos recopilados, utilizando tabletas, demuestra el potencial de esta herramienta a la investigación arqueológica y las dificultadas a las que se enfrentan los proyectos que dependen fuertemente de SIG.

  {"id":"shea2011","abstract":"Paleolithic archaeologists conceptualize the uniqueness of Homo sapiens in terms of “behavioral modernity,” a quality often conflated with behavioral variability. The former is qualitative, essentialist, and a historical artifact of the European origins of Paleolithic research. The latter is a quantitative, statistically variable property of all human behavior, not just that of Ice Age Europeans. As an analytical construct, behavioral modernity is deeply flawed at all epistemological levels. This paper outlines the shortcomings of behavioral modernity and instead proposes a research agenda focused on the strategic sources of human behavioral variability. Using data from later Middle Pleistocene archaeological sites in East Africa, this paper tests and falsifies the core assumption of the behavioral-modernity concept—the belief that there were significant differences in behavioral variability between the oldest H. sapiens and populations younger than 50 kya. It concludes that behavioral modernity and allied concepts have no further value to human origins research. Research focused on the strategic underpinnings of human behavioral variability will move Paleolithic archaeology closer to a more productive integration with other behavioral sciences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Shea","given":"John J."},{"family":"Adler","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Barham","given":"Larry"},{"family":"Conard","given":"Nicholas J."},{"family":"Eren","given":"Metin I."},{"family":"Lombard","given":"Marlize"},{"family":"Nowell","given":"April"},{"family":"O’Connell","given":"J.

  {"id":"shepherd2003","abstract":"This article gives an account of the development of archaeology in South Africa in the period 1870–2003, focusing on key formative ideas and contexts. Taking as its theme a Foucauldian notion of ‘knowledge construction’, it attempts to understand archaeology as a form of social practice rooted in broader political and economic contexts. Two periods were especially important in the emergence of South African archaeology. The first was the period 1923–1948, coinciding with the local career of John Goodwin, which saw the institutionalisation of archaeology and the emergence of a specific, local conception of prehistory under the political patronage of J. C. Smuts. During these years the study of prehistory played a key role in an emergent South African national identity. The second was the period of the late 1960s and early 1970s which saw the re-emergence of the discipline following a time of comparative neglect, as part of the general cultural apparatus of a modernising apartheid state. Finally, a detailed account is given of developments post- 1994, including figures for student enrolments at major teaching institutions, a survey of archaeological curricula and a survey of grants from the National Research Foundation. If (as I argue) the impulse of the discipline in periods of social transformation has been to take shelter behind hard versions of science and culture, then the challenge for a post-apartheid archaeology lies in developing socially engaged and reflexive forms of theory and practice able to speak to the complexity of contemporary circumstances.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Shepherd","given":"Nick"}],"citation-key":"shepherd2003","container-title":"Journal of Southern African Studies","DOI":"10.1080/0305707032000135842","ISSN":"0305-7070","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",12,1]]},"page":"823-844","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"State of the Discipline: Science, Culture and Identity in South African Archaeology, 1870–2003","title-short":"State of the Discipline","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/0305707032000135842","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"shott2019","abstract":"Flake assemblages often are mixtures from knapping episodes that vary by reduction mode or stage. Stahle and Dunn (1982) developed a constrained least-squares regression (CLSR) method to allocate hypothetically mixed chert assemblages to successive biface-reduction stages, a partial solution to the mixing problem. ConReg is a recently developed alternative, validated against Stahle and Dunn's and our own experimental controls from replication of obsidian biface preforms. Using both controls, we apply ConReg to the “unmixing” of flake assemblages from North American Great Basin obsidian quarries. Controls produce different solutions; their separate comparison to independent analytical results of stage composition favor ConReg used with our controls. What appeared to be relatively similar early “stage” assemblages are resolved to finer proportional allocation across wider ranges of the reduction continuum, in the process showing considerable variation between samples that otherwise might escape detection. The mixture problem is a challenge to all approaches to flake analysis, not just mass analysis, but one that ConReg can help us surmount.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Shott","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Habtzghi","given":"Desale"}],"citation-key":"shott2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2019.01.003","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,1]]},"page":"46-56","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The mixture problem in flake analysis: Allocating flake samples to segments of reduction using CLSR methods","title-short":"The mixture problem in flake analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440318304941","volume":"103"},
  {"id":"shoval2017","abstract":"Microanalyses methods by LA-ICP-MS, EPMA (SEM, WDS and EDS) and Raman micro-spectroscopy were applied in analyses of the black and the red decorations and the ceramic-body of an Iron Age Phoenician Bichrome pottery at Tel Dor on the Carmel coast of Israel. The current study aimed to identify the technology utilized in the Bichrome decoration in Phoenician workshops. Chemical analyses with LA-ICP-MS and EPMA (WDS and EDS) demonstrate that the black decoration contains Fe2O3 and MnO, whereas the red decoration consists of Fe2O3 but is poor in MnO. These compositions are in accordance with the use of ferromanganese and ferruginous based pigments for the black and the red decorations, respectively. The ceramic-body is calcareous and consists of SiO2 and Al2O3 of the fired-clay and CaO of calcite. EPMA-SEM images of the pigment layers show fragmented microstructures in which small pigment particles are coated on the ceramic-body substrate. EPMA-WDS elemental maps of the painted decorations illustrate non-homogeneous distribution patterns of Fe2O3, MnO, which are in accordance with the fragmented microstructures. The results reveal the use of the manganese based technique in the black decoration of the Bichrome pottery in Phoenician workshops. With this technique, painting with both ferromanganese pigment and with ferruginous pigment facilitates simultaneous black and red decorations of the Bichrome pottery through a single firing in an oxidizing atmosphere. The identification of hematite in the painted decorations by Raman micro-spectroscopy confirms firing of the Bichrome pottery in an oxidizing atmosphere.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Shoval","given":"Shlomo"}],"citation-key":"shoval2017","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2017.03.040","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",3,27]]},"source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The application of LA-ICP-MS, EPMA and Raman micro-spectroscopy methods in the study of Iron Age Phoenician Bichrome pottery at Tel Dor","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X17301797"},

  {"id":"silva-gago2019","abstract":"Humans have evolved a distinctive relationship with “objects” (tools and technology), which has strongly influenced their anatomical and cognitive capacities. The human hand is functionally specialized for manipulation and, in terms of cognition, tools are generally integrated into the body scheme when handled. Stone tools can supply information on the evolution of this cognitive reciprocal relationship. Despite the many studies on stone tool morphology, information on hand-tool system is scanty. In this preliminary survey, we measure hand-tool distances in three lithic instruments of different size (cleaver, handaxe, convergent sidescraper), in order to investigate basic patterns associated with their handling patterns. Tool size does influence the distance from the wrist and the aperture of the hand. The associated grasping differences depend more on the tool length than on the hand morphology or dimension. Nonetheless, hand-tool metrics covariation patterns are different according to the different tool types, suggesting specific factors associated with their respective haptic experience. Females display, on average, more variability than males when handling the sidescraper, but not for the power-gripped cleaver and handaxe. We propose a new method to analyze hand-tool metrics according to the haptic interaction. These kinds of studies provide basic mandatory information which can be used to develop proper ergonomic and cognitive perspectives in tool extension and cognitive archaeology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Silva-Gago","given":"María"},{"family":"Fedato","given":"Annapaola"},{"family":"Rios-Garaizar","given":"Joseba"},{"family":"Bruner","given":"Emiliano"}],"citation-key":"silva-gago2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2018.11.012","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,1]]},"page":"567-573","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A preliminary survey on hand grip and hand-tool morphometrics in three different stone tools","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18305777","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"silva2014","abstract":"The orientations of European prehistoric structures have been studied independently by landscape archaeologists and archaeoastronomers. Despite their similar interests, the two fields have failed to converge primarily because of their differing epistemologies. This paper argues that archaeology has much to gain by integrating the two fields to provide a fuller and more balanced exploration and understanding of the location and orientation of the European megaliths. It is suggested that prehistoric archaeoastronomy needs to become more grounded on the archaeological record and context of the prehistoric structures it studies. If it is to generate knowledge of value to archaeology it needs to become a “skyscape archaeology.” This paper looks at current archaeoastronomical approaches through the lens of archaeological practice. It identifies some limitations and discusses how landscape archaeology can inform archaeoastronomy on overcoming them. A methodology that attempts this necessary cross-fertilization, by shedding unfounded assumptions and developing a more phenomenological approach to pattern-recognition, is proposed. This methodology is applied to a case study in central Portugal. The emergent narrative, linking a cluster of dolmens to a local mountain range and the star Aldebaran, not only fits the archaeological record, but is mirrored by local folklore, lending further support to the validity of this methodology.\n, \nEl estudio de las orientaciones de las estructuras prehistóricas europeas se ha llevado a cabo de forma independiente por los arqueólogos del paisaje y por los arqueoastrónomos. A pesar de sus intereses similares, los dos campos no han podido converger, sobre todo, debido a sus diferentes epistemologías. Este trabajo sustenta que, la arqueología tiene mucho que ganar con la integración de los dos campos, al proporcionar una exploración y comprensión más completa y equilibrada de la localización y orientación de los megalitos europeos. La arqueoastronomía prehistórica, como se sugiere, necesita apoyarse más en el registro arqueológico y en el contexto de las estructuras prehistóricas que estudia. Si se trata de generar conocimiento de valor para la arqueología, ésta debe convertirse en una “arqueología del skyscape”. Este trabajo examina los planteamientos de la arqueoastronomía a través de la práctica arqueológica. Este mismo identifica algunas limitaciones y analiza cómo la arqueología de paisaje puede indicar a la arqueoastronomía el cómo superarlas. Una metodología que intenta esta necesaria hibridación, desechando suposiciones infundadas y el desarrollo de una perspectiva más fenomenológica al reconocimiento de patrones, es la propuesta. Esta metodología se aplica a un caso de estudio en el centro de Portugal. La narrativa que surge y que relaciona a un conjunto de dólmenes con una cadena montañosa local y con la Estrella Aldebarán, no sólo se presenta en el registro arqueológico, sino que está reflejada en el folklore local, dándole un mayor apoyo a la validez de esta metodología.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Silva","given":"Fabio"}],"citation-key":"silva2014","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.7183/2326-3768.2.1.24","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",2]]},"language":"en","page":"24-37","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"A Tomb with a View: New Methods for Bridging the Gap Between Land and Sky in Megalithic Archaeology","title-short":"A Tomb with a View","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/tomb-with-a-view/4A706663D746CB52836F2069B35DC6BA","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"sismondo1993","abstract":"It is usually assumed that the `social construction' metaphor has one key meaning that is well understood across social studies of science. But a look at some of the texts that were, and are, central to introducing and defining `social construction' in science studies shows that there are widely varying uses of the metaphor: processes of construction differ with the types of objects that can be constructed. This paper identifies four prominent interpretations that have led to interesting insights and discussions. Though these different social constructions have generally been fused together in science studies, they are easily separable, and should be separated, since they are not equally tenable. In particular, `neo-Kantian' or `idealist' constructivism has weak arguments supporting it and, contrary to the standard rhetoric, is the least important of these different constructivisms to most of the actual work done in social studies of science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Sismondo","given":"Sergio"}],"citation-key":"sismondo1993","container-title":"Social Studies of Science","container-title-short":"Soc Stud Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0306312793023003004","ISSN":"0306-3127","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"515-553","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Some Social Constructions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0306312793023003004","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"smith2018","abstract":"This paper explores the embedding of data producing technologies in people's everyday lives and practices. It traces how repeated encounters with digital data operate to naturalise these entities, while often blindsiding their agentive properties and the ways they get implicated in processes of exploitation and governance. I propose and develop the notion of ‘data doxa’ to conceptualise the way in which digital data – and the devices and platforms that stage data – have come to be perceived in Western societies as normal, necessary and enabling. The ‘data doxa’ concept also accentuates the enculturation of many individuals into a data sharing habitus which frames digital technologies in simplistic terms as (a) panaceas for the problems associated with contemporary life, (b) figures of progress and convenience, and (c) mediums of knowledge, pleasure and identity. I suggest that three types of data-based relations contribute to the formation of this doxic sensibility: fetishisation, habit and enchantment. Each of these relations come to mediate public understandings of digital devices and the data they generate, obscuring the multifaceted nature and hidden depths of data and their propensity to double up as technologies of exposure and discipline. As a result of this situation, imaginative educational programs and revamped regulatory frameworks are urgently needed to inform individuals about the contribution of data to the leveraging of value and power in today's digital economies, but also to protect them from experiencing data-based harms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Gavin JD"}],"citation-key":"smith2018","container-title":"Big Data & Society","container-title-short":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/2053951717751551","ISSN":"2053-9517, 2053-9517","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1]]},"language":"en","page":"205395171775155","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Data doxa: The affective consequences of data practices","title-short":"Data doxa","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053951717751551","volume":"5"},

It begins with historical reasons for the lack of attention to argumentation in recent decades. Next, it reviews the status of archaeological argumentation as set out in a 2015 paper (Smith ME, SAA Archaeol Record 15:18–23, 2015b). This is followed by an expansion of this line of thought based on a methodological approach initiated by Stephen Toulmin in 1958. Toulmin’s scheme is based on visual diagrams to show the sequential steps in an argument. It is a particularly helpful method to show the difference between strong and weak archaeological arguments about the past. I examine four archaeological arguments, and use Toulmin’s method to assess their strength. The final topic is an examination of archaeological modeling as a form of argument.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Michael E."}],"citation-key":"smith2023","collection-title":"Quantitative Archaeology and Archaeological Modelling","container-title":"Discourse and Argumentation in Archaeology: Conceptual and Computational Approaches","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-031-37156-1_3","editor":[{"family":"Gonzalez-Perez","given":"Cesar"},{"family":"Martin-Rodilla","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Pereira-Fariña","given":"Martín"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-031-37156-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"37-54","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"Making Good Arguments in Archaeology","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-37156-1_3"},

  {"id":"sobotkova2018","abstract":"The ease of digital data capture and the proliferation of concepts such as the “data deluge” suggest that modern researchers are drowning in datasets. Yet citations of archaeological datasets are few and far between, pointing to low rates of data reuse. This article explores the difficulties that surround data reuse in large-scale regional research, including the cost and coordination necessary to extract useful data from digitized PDF reports. The amount of correction and enhancement matches the effort needed to undertake a small field survey project and can only be circumvented with a thoughtful application of computer-assisted text analysis. Missing data in excavation report PDFs are not only intractable but also insidious due to their concealed nature, leading to poor outcomes in terms of (re)use. Consequently, the degree of data reuse in archaeology has been overestimated., La facilidad de captura de datos digitales y la proliferación de conceptos como el “diluvio de datos” sugieren que la investigación moderna se está ahogando en conjuntos de datos. Sin embargo, las citas de conjuntos de datos arqueológicos son escasas, lo que apunta a bajas tasas de reutilización de datos arqueológicos. Este artículo explora las dificultades relacionadas con la reutilización de datos en la investigación regional a gran escala, incluyendo el costo y la coordinación necesarios para extraer datos útiles de los informes digitalizados en PDF. La cantidad de corrección y mejora que se requiere iguala el esfuerzo necesario para llevar a cabo un pequeño proyecto de prospección de campo.

We reused and adapted two existing customizations from the FAIMS library for comprehensive digital recording of two workflows, integrating a collection of structured data, geospatial data, photos, and text. FAIMS Mobile required only modest hardware but supported offline setup, synchronization, and data export, allowing PPAP to deploy it despite unreliable internet access. The system proved successful; it was tailored to our aims and methods, captured consistent and well-described data rapidly, and minimized post-processing.

  {"id":"sobotkova2024","abstract":"Purpose This paper provides practical advice for archaeologists and heritage specialists wishing to use ML approaches to identify archaeological features in high-resolution satellite imagery (or other remotely sensed data sources). We seek to balance the disproportionately optimistic literature related to the application of ML to archaeological prospection through a discussion of limitations, challenges and other difficulties. We further seek to raise awareness among researchers of the time, effort, expertise and resources necessary to implement ML successfully, so that they can make an informed choice between ML and manual inspection approaches. Design/methodology/approach Automated object detection has been the holy grail of archaeological remote sensing for the last two decades. Machine learning (ML) models have proven able to detect uniform features across a consistent background, but more variegated imagery remains a challenge. We set out to detect burial mounds in satellite imagery from a diverse landscape in Central Bulgaria using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) plus additional but low-touch training to improve performance. Training was accomplished using MOUND/NOT MOUND cutouts, and the model assessed arbitrary tiles of the same size from the image. Results were assessed using field data. Findings Validation of results against field data showed that self-reported success rates were misleadingly high, and that the model was misidentifying most features. Setting an identification threshold at 60% probability, and noting that we used an approach where the CNN assessed tiles of a fixed size, tile-based false negative rates were 95–96%, false positive rates were 87–95% of tagged tiles, while true positives were only 5–13%. Counterintuitively, the model provided with training data selected for highly visible mounds (rather than all mounds) performed worse. Development of the model, meanwhile, required approximately 135 person-hours of work. Research limitations/implications Our attempt to deploy a pre-trained CNN demonstrates the limitations of this approach when it is used to detect varied features of different sizes within a heterogeneous landscape that contains confounding natural and modern features, such as roads, forests and field boundaries. The model has detected incidental features rather than the mounds themselves, making external validation with field data an essential part of CNN workflows. Correcting the model would require refining the training data as well as adopting different approaches to model choice and execution, raising the computational requirements beyond the level of most cultural heritage practitioners. Practical implications Improving the pre-trained model’s performance would require considerable time and resources, on top of the time already invested. The degree of manual intervention required – particularly around the subsetting and annotation of training data – is so significant that it raises the question of whether it would be more efficient to identify all of the mounds manually, either through brute-force inspection by experts or by crowdsourcing the analysis to trained – or even untrained – volunteers. Researchers and heritage specialists seeking efficient methods for extracting features from remotely sensed data should weigh the costs and benefits of ML versus manual approaches carefully. Social implications Our literature review indicates that use of artificial intelligence (AI) and ML approaches to archaeological prospection have grown exponentially in the past decade, approaching adoption levels associated with “crossing the chasm” from innovators and early adopters to the majority of researchers. The literature itself, however, is overwhelmingly positive, reflecting some combination of publication bias and a rhetoric of unconditional success. This paper presents the failure of a good-faith attempt to utilise these approaches as a counterbalance and cautionary tale to potential adopters of the technology. Early-majority adopters may find ML difficult to implement effectively in real-life scenarios. Originality/value Unlike many high-profile reports from well-funded projects, our paper represents a serious but modestly resourced attempt to apply an ML approach to archaeological remote sensing, using techniques like transfer learning that are promoted as solutions to time and cost problems associated with, e.g. annotating and manipulating training data. While the majority of articles uncritically promote ML, or only discuss how challenges were overcome, our paper investigates how – despite reasonable self-reported scores – the model failed to locate the target features when compared to field data. We also present time, expertise and resourcing requirements, a rarity in ML-for-archaeology publications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Sobotkova","given":"Adela"},{"family":"Kristensen-McLachlan","given":"Ross Deans"},{"family":"Mallon","given":"Orla"},{"family":"Ross","given":"Shawn Adrian"}],"citation-key":"sobotkova2024","container-title":"Journal of Documentation","DOI":"10.1108/JD-05-2022-0096","ISSN":"0022-0418","issue":"ahead-of-print","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,1]]},"source":"Emerald Insight","title":"Validating predictions of burial mounds with field data: the promise and reality of machine learning","title-short":"Validating predictions of burial mounds with field data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-05-2022-0096","volume":"ahead-of-print"},

For that purpose, the paper develops the following story line. We begin by noting the frequent controversies around heritage and its prosecution when discrepancies emerge. Next, we analyze a Spanish legal sentence about cultural heritage focusing on its causal structure and lexicon. In this respect, relevant aspects of causality are discussed both from a logical and a lexical point of view, which makes it possible to extract from the text of the judgment those sentences that are causally most salient. Differences between causality of physical and law facts are also cleared. Finally, a causal graph is depicted from the selected set of causal phrases of the sentence and a Bayesian analysis is applied to separate effective causes from the spurious ones for understanding the judge’s verdict, concluding the usefulness of the causal analysis with the aim to grasp the factual and evidentiary contents of a sentence about heritage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Sobrino","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Calderón-Cerrato","given":"Beatriz"}],"citation-key":"sobrino2023","collection-title":"Quantitative Archaeology and Archaeological Modelling","container-title":"Discourse and Argumentation in Archaeology: Conceptual and Computational Approaches","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-031-37156-1_4","editor":[{"family":"Gonzalez-Perez","given":"Cesar"},{"family":"Martin-Rodilla","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Pereira-Fariña","given":"Martín"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-031-37156-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"55-91","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"A Causal Model Application to a Cultural Heritage Sentence Analysis","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-37156-1_4"},
  {"id":"soin2023","abstract":"How individuals comply with, and resist performance measures and metrics can be seen as a key concern in management and organization. Recent literature has advanced our understanding of compliance as a social practice which is often related to resistance. Yet, compliance is seen as something we equate with simply yielding to power without any agency. We address this theme with a study of the effects of managerialism on academic work. More specifically, we investigate the introduction of measures and controls to improve PhD completion times in a research-intensive UK university. Our findings show that despite most of our respondents voicing concerns about the reductionist nature of the target and the consequences for quality, the large majority of academics we talked to complied with the measure. We identify three compliance types that demonstrate compliance is an interpretative process. We make two principal contributions with this paper. First, we offer insights into why compliance deserves analytic attention as a social practice in its own right, as something that goes beyond mere consent. Second, we analyze the impact of managerialism on higher education through the lens of compliance. We use these insights to reflect on how compliance was linked to resistance and the effects of different compliance practices on academic work which ranged from shifting responsibilities to challenging academic integrity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Soin","given":"Kim"},{"family":"Huber","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"soin2023","container-title":"Organization","DOI":"10.1177/13505084211066810","ISSN":"1350-5084","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1130-1151","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Compliance and resistance: How performance measures make and unmake universities","title-short":"Compliance and resistance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/13505084211066810","volume":"30"},

Vagueness and vague experiences can structure material categorisations of the world; it can contribute to the shaping of social relations and nurture the appreciation of difficult experiences. However, the recent archaeological (re)turn to science as the main provider of knowledge of the past renders vagueness futile as an empirical occurrence through its exorcism of elusiveness and ambiguity in the notorious pursuit of absolute, exact and quantifiable facts. This article challenges the pursuit and use of exact data in archaeological science and the consequential implications of the omission of vague occurrences, discussing the problem that ambiguous and absent evidence become neglected in subsequent conclusion. Second, it is demonstrated that vagueness and ambiguity can be integral to certain social and material phenomena. Third, the article examines recent archaeological analyses of burial practices in South Scandinavian passage graves from the Middle Neolithic in order to discuss the pursuit of certitude in archaeological observations and interpretations. Finally, it is argued that the idealisation of certitude in archaeological analysis needs to be complemented by an interpretative framework making it possible to recognise vagueness as a social phenomenon.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Sørensen","given":"Tim Flohr"}],"citation-key":"sorensen2016","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-015-9257-8","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"741-763","source":"link-springer-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca","title":"In Praise of Vagueness: Uncertainty, Ambiguity and Archaeological Methodology","title-short":"In Praise of Vagueness","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-015-9257-8","volume":"23"},

In the second part, we proceed to discussing ways of embracing the speculative mandate, referring back to our engagements with the art/archaeology project Ineligible and reflections on how to work with the unknowns and uncertainties of archaeology. In the third and last part, we conclude by making the case for fertilizing the archaeological potential nested in the empirical encounter, creating more inceptions than conclusions, fostering ambiguities, contradictions and new spaces of experiential inquiry. This leads us to suggest that—when working with the archaeological—speculation should be seen not only as a privilege, but also as an obligation, due to the inherent and inescapable uncertainties of the discipline.

  {"id":"spikins2018","abstract":"Traits in Upper Palaeolithic art which are also seen in the work of talented artists with autism, including most obviously an exceptional realism, remain to be explained. However any association between the famously evocative animal depictions created in the European Upper Palaeolithic and what is commonly seen as a ‘disorder’ has always been contentious. Debate over these similarities has been heated, with explanations ranging from famous works of Upper Palaeolithic art having been created by individuals with autism spectrum conditions, to being influenced by such individuals, to being a product of the use of psychotropic drugs. Here we argue that ‘autistic traits’ in art, such as extreme realism, have been created by individuals with a cognitive extreme of local processing bias, or detail focus. The significance of local processing bias, which is found both as a feature of autism spectrum conditions and in artists with exceptional talent at realistic depiction who aren’t autistic, has implications for our understanding of Upper Palaeolithic society in general, as well as of the roles played by individuals with autism spectrum conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Spikins","given":"Penny"},{"family":"Scott","given":"Callum"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Barry"}],"citation-key":"spikins2018","container-title":"Open Archaeology","DOI":"10.1515/opar-2018-0016","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"262–279","source":"DeGruyter","title":"How Do We Explain ‛Autistic Traits’ in European Upper Palaeolithic Art?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/opar.2018.4.issue-1/opar-2018-0016/opar-2018-0016.xml?format=INT","volume":"4"},

By carrying out a comparative analysis in six European countries (Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Italy, Poland, and the United Kingdom), it covers different models of media systems and journalistic cultures envisaged by Hallin and Mancini. Based on a desk review and in-depth interviews with instructors of data journalism in each country, the article identifies different approaches to the way data journalism is taught. In Europe, such programs are offered by four types of organizations: academic, vocational, professional, and civic. The role played by those organizations can be explained as a result of the peculiarities of national media systems. But there are also commonalities, for example, non-academic institutions (such as the European Journalism Center or the Center for Investigative Journalism) and major international news outlets (such as The Guardian and The New York Times) seem to take over a leading role in all of the analyzed countries. Generally speaking, data journalism education appears to be a very young discipline that frequently neglects fundamental journalistic topics such as ethical issues, transparency, accountability, and responsiveness although they are crucial in a journalistic field as sophisticated tools to reveal hidden aspects of reality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Splendore","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Di Salvo","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Eberwein","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Groenhart","given":"Harmen"},{"family":"Kus","given":"Michal"},{"family":"Porlezza","given":"Colin"}],"citation-key":"splendore2016","container-title":"Journalism","container-title-short":"Journalism","DOI":"10.1177/1464884915612683","ISSN":"1464-8849","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"138-152","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Educational strategies in data journalism: A comparative study of six European countries","title-short":"Educational strategies in data journalism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1464884915612683","volume":"17"},

It also is frequently mundane to the point of boredom, involving things such as plugs, standards, and bureaucratic forms. Some of the difficulties of studying infrastructure are how to scale up from traditional ethnographic sites, how to manage large quantities of data such as those produced by transaction logs, and how to understand the interplay of online and offline behavior. Some of the tricks of the trade involved in meeting these challenges include studying the design of infrastructure, understanding the paradoxes of infrastructure as both transparent and opaque, including invisible work in the ecological analysis, and pinpointing the epistemological status of indictors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Star","given":"Susan Leigh"}],"citation-key":"star1999","container-title":"American Behavioral Scientist","container-title-short":"American Behavioral Scientist","DOI":"10.1177/00027649921955326","ISSN":"0002-7642","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"377-391","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Ethnography of Infrastructure","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00027649921955326","volume":"43"},

In doing so, she charts the cable network's cultural, historical, geographic and environmental dimensions. Starosielski argues that the environments the cables occupy are historical and political realms, where the network and the connections it enables are made possible by the deliberate negotiation and manipulation of technology, culture, politics and geography.

  {"id":"stebbins2009","abstract":"The serious leisure perspective is introduced and its relationship to library and information science (LIS) set out. The relationship is twofold: the perspective offers a distinctive approach both to research and to practice in this discipline. That is, the perspective bridges a critical gap that has separated the fields of LIS and leisure studies, manifested in both as scant concern with the central interest of the other. This gap is bridged by providing the first with a conceptual framework for understanding leisure and leisure activities, which can help guide researchers and practitioners working on the retrieval and dissemination of information bearing on such activities. The serious leisure perspective is the theoretic structure that synthesizes three main forms of leisure. Serious leisure is the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer core activity that captivates the participant with its challenges and complexity. Casual leisure is an immediately, intrinsically rewarding, relatively short-lived pleasurable core activity, requiring little or no special training to enjoy it. Project-based leisure refers to a short term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional, though infrequent, creative undertaking carried out in free time. Serious leisure is the most complex of these three, offering thereby the richest lode for LIS researchers and practitioners to mine. The perspective is a vehicle for systematically exploring people's use and dissemination of information during free time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Stebbins","given":"Robert A."}],"citation-key":"stebbins2009","container-title":"Library Trends","DOI":"10.1353/lib.0.0064","ISSN":"1559-0682","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",6,26]]},"page":"618-631","source":"Project MUSE","title":"Leisure and Its Relationship to Library and: Information Science: Bridging the Gap","title-short":"Leisure and Its Relationship to Library and","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/269289","volume":"57"},

  {"id":"steeves2020","abstract":"Project Overview This project contains the data that underlies the behavioral study done as a part of Investigating &amp; Archiving the Scholarly Git Experience (IASGE), a funded project thanks to the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. IASGE addresses the need to investigate how academics are using Git hosting platforms, how they can be adapted to academic needs, and how the scholarship hosted on them can be archived. The results of this project aim to inform the that scholarship on Git hosting platforms move from a phase where they are highly active and collaborative, to a state where they are stable, permanently citable, and under active, professional preservation. This half of the IASGE project, the behavioral study, is a three-part, mixed methods empirical approach to understand the scholarly users of Git and Git hosting platforms (GHP) whose use patterns vary from beginner to advanced. Methods employed include focus group sessions, a survey, and interviews. The data used include, but are not limited to, user profiles, frequency of feature use, and common practices, all which inform how librarians can support scholars in sustainable and long-term research. Through focus groups, a survey, and interviews, the study considers two groups of scholars: those who actively use Git to conduct their research within the academy, and those who are aware of Git but have not fully adopted it into their workflow in a standardized way. While each scholar may have varying reasons and degrees to which they include Git throughout their workflows, they all belong to the community of scholars who have the potential to utilize the power of Git to optimize their research and scholarship output.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Steeves","given":"Vicky"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Sarah"}],"citation-key":"steeves2020","contributor":[{"family":"Steeves","given":"Vicky"}],"DOI":"10.5064/F6VOIB8H","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"publisher":"Qualitative Data Repository","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Investigating and Archiving the Scholarly Git Experience","type":"dataset","URL":"https://data.qdr.syr.edu/citation?persistentId=doi:10.5064/F6VOIB8H"},

  {"id":"steinmann2021","abstract":"This article introduces datplot, an R package designed to prepare chronological data for visualization, focusing on the treatment of objects dated to overlapping periods of time. Datplot is suitable for all disciplines in which scientists long for a synoptic method that enables the visualization of the chronology of a collection of heterogeneously dated objects. It is especially helpful for visualizing trends in object assemblages over long periods of time—for example, the development of pottery styles—and it can also assist in the dating of stratigraphy. As both authors come from the field of classical archaeology, the examples and case study demonstrating the functionality of the package analyze classical materials. In particular, we focus on presenting an assemblage of epigraphic evidence from Bithynia (northwestern Turkey), with a microregional focal point in the territory of Nicaea (modern Iznik). In the article, we present the internal methodology of datplot and the process of preparing a dataset of categorically and numerically dated objects. We demonstrate visualizing the data prepared by datplot using kernel density estimation and compare the outcome with more established methods such as histograms and line graphs.\n, \nEste artículo presenta “datplot”, un paquete R diseñado para preparar datos cronológicos para visualización.

  {"id":"stemp2019","abstract":"The application of micro- and nanotechnology, adopted from engineering and materials sciences, is proving valuable in studying stone tool surfaces. Measurement systems for surface characterization have been coupled with parameters that allow for the mathematical characterization of stone tool surfaces. For this project, a Sensofar S neox imaging confocal microscope (ICM)/focus variation microscope (FVM) and an Olympus LEXT OLS4100 laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) are used to mathematically document the edge cross-sections on five chipped stone tools made from basalt, chert, obsidian, and quartz. Based on the surface documentation of edge cross-sections, a new algorithm for the calculation of edge curvature at multiple scales is tested. Results indicate the confocal systems experience difficulty documenting edge cross-sections. However, focus variation microscopy can mathematically document edge cross-sections on stone tools made from basalt and chert, thus permitting the calculation of edge curvature over multiple scales of measurement. Microscale documentation of edge cross-sections and calculation of edge curvature will be helpful in understanding the relationships between tool edges, edge sharpness, edge attrition, and microwear. Comparisons between these three measurement systems (ICM, LSCM, FVM) provide information necessary for further method development in edge cross-section measurement and the potential to generate more robust edge analysis protocols.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Stemp","given":"W.

  {"id":"stevenson2019","abstract":"The process of dating ancient obsidian artifacts converts the quantity of surface diffused molecular water to a calendar age using an experimentally derived diffusion coefficient predicted from glass composition. The internal structural water content of rhyolitic obsidian has been identified as a highly influential variable that controls the rate of water diffusion at ambient temperature. We demonstrate through the use of infrared spectroscopy and specific gravity (density) measurements on samples from 34 obsidian sources that total structural water (H2Ot) concentrations between sources can range from 0.07% to 1.66%. Structural water concentration within individual sources may also vary significantly and impact the accuracy of estimated ages for artifact manufacture if not properly monitored. A calibration for the water determination on individual samples by density measurement is developed here and the impact of structural water variation on obsidian chronometric dates is discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Stevenson","given":"Christopher M."},{"family":"Rogers","given":"Alexander K."},{"family":"Glascock","given":"Michael D."}],"citation-key":"stevenson2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2018.10.032","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,1]]},"page":"231-242","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Variability in obsidian structural water content and its importance in the hydration dating of cultural artifacts","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18304619","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"stewart2006","abstract":"Research on the earliest habitation of Cyprus has largely been limited to the finds from excavation at a few sites, or gazetteer-style lists compiled from earlier surveys and fortuitous finds. Generally, though, there was little interest in finding and researching small lithic scatters and resource areas that may be of importance in unravelling the patterns of prehistoric land use. This thesis looks specifically at archaeological evidence from two research projects, the Canadian Palaipaphos Survey Project (CPSP) in southwest Cyprus and the Idalion Survey Project (ISP) in the central Troodos foothills. I focus on the distribution of, and the relationship between, large habitation sites, small, enigmatic lithic scatters and lithic resource areas. I support this with a study of ethnographic research on modern land use behaviour, and ethnoarchaeological research on the modern dhoukani (threshing sledge) industry. This latter is especially important as it sheds light not only on the locations and quality of numerous chert sources in both study areas, but documents modern behaviour in lithic acquisition, production and distribution, which may be crucial for understanding how lithic craftsmen worked in the past.\nDuring the course of my survey work, it became apparent to me that observer bias had a profound effect on the identification, collection and interpretation of the archaeological data. A major part of this thesis focusses on ways to identify and correct for a number of these types of biases. Taking into account these limitations on the results from the surveys, my research suggests that the early Neolithic inhabitants were not optimizing costs in lithic raw material selection, but were intentionally exploiting distant sources, despite having excellent quality sources much closer to their habitation sites. Based on the ethnographic and ethnoarchaeological studies, I suggest that this was the result of intentional strategies of risk management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Stewart","given":"Sarah Tyrrell"}],"citation-key":"stewart2006","event-place":"Canada","genre":"Ph.D.","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"English","license":"Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","number-of-pages":"374","publisher":"University of Toronto (Canada)","publisher-place":"Canada","source":"ProQuest","title":"Walking in Cyprus: Ancient landscapes and modern bias","title-short":"Walking in Cyprus","type":"thesis","URL":"http://search.proquest.com/docview/304924464/abstract/A093056898164D8DPQ/1"},

  {"id":"stobiecka2020a","abstract":"The last 20 years mark a period of transformation from a traditional model of displaying archaeology to a more immersive model supported by digital and virtual media. The traditional model has generally used glass cases accompanied by extensive texts to inform visitors, whereas the immersive model employs digital media, tablets, virtual reality, and augmented reality to attract and engage a wide audience. In light of the recent enthusiasm for the latter, however, one must ask whether such immersive exhibitions are merely superficial means to make public institutions more attractive without having a meaningful impact on audience engagement. Polish archaeological museums provide interesting sites through which to explore this predicament. Here, digital upgrades are generously financed by national funds, so the traditional model of the archaeological museum in Poland is currently almost absent. In this short review, I aim to discuss one of the most interesting examples of temporary digital archaeological exhibitions organized between 2014 and 2019 in the Polish capital of Warsaw. I investigate its potential to engage audiences, ultimately concluding that it managed to create an interesting counterweight to traditional displays and respond to the drawbacks of new digital exhibitions through novel aesthetics and alternative archaeological storytelling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Stobiecka","given":"Monika"}],"citation-key":"stobiecka2020a","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2020.27","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8]]},"language":"en","page":"313-318","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Farewell to Tradition?

  {"id":"stobiecka2020b","abstract":"Digital archaeologists claim that their practices have proven to be an important tool for mediating conflict, ensuring that the digital turn in archaeology entails engaging in current political issues. This can be questioned by analysing a copy of the Syrian Arch of Triumph. The original was destroyed in 2015. A year later, a copy was carved out of Egyptian marble; the replica was constructed thanks to digital documentation, which allowed archaeologists to create a 3D model. The arch was placed in various Western locations; however, it never reached Syria. Hybridity, the cultural and political significance of the arch’s replica and its ‘Grand Tour’ invite us to think about different interpretive layers of this artefact of ideological discourse (ontological, epistemological, ethical). In this paper, the replica of the Syrian arch will be analysed through the frameworks of post-colonial theory and technology studies. Both perspectives provide an insight into promising advantages and alarming drawbacks of such digital practices. This paper argues that the case of a copy of the Syrian Arch of Triumph on the one hand reflects the contemporary colonial technocracy in heritage politics (an ethical dimension), and on the other demonstrates that an ideological aspect of its digital reconstruction emerges from a speculative anticipation of what might constitute the universal value of world heritage in the future (an onto-epistemological dimension).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Stobiecka","given":"Monika"}],"citation-key":"stobiecka2020b","container-title":"Archaeological Dialogues","DOI":"10.1017/S1380203820000239","ISSN":"1380-2038, 1478-2294","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"language":"en","page":"113-125","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Archaeological heritage in the age of digital colonialism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/archaeological-dialogues/article/archaeological-heritage-in-the-age-of-digital-colonialism/656C0B0B42262DE846FBFAD34654397F","volume":"27"},

Despite this rich literature, however, the archaeological researcher who wishes to use collections in archives, museums, or repositories for the first time is often perplexed by how to gain access to collections, how to communicate with archive/museum/repository professionals, the constraints that archive/museum/repository professionals work under, and—at an even more basic level—what the difference between an archive, a museum, and a repository actually is. This article addresses some of these questions and provides a practical guide to opening up the vast research opportunities presented by existing collections., Un examen detenido de revistas arqueológicas y de museos revela que hay una copiosa literatura sobre temas tales como el rol de los museos y repositorios en la investigación antropológica, el compromiso con las poblaciones indígenas o descendientes por parte de arqueólogos que trabajan en una variedad de situaciones (incluyendo la investigación basada en colecciones) y la investigación centrada en el estudio de colecciones arqueológicas existentes.

In light of technological advances in digital imaging and recent archaeological and palaeontological discoveries on the island we re-assess the dating of the petroglyphs and prove that some were made in the Late Pleistocene, or Upper Palaeolithic.

Twelve social anthropologists look at this influential and controversial phenomenon, and map out the effects around Europe and the Commonwealth, as well as in contexts such as the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and Academic institutions.

Interdisciplinary practice has become well entrenched in any number of scientific disciplines, or disciplines from the humanities or from social science for that matter. This does not deter current rhetoric which sees new opportunities in new combinations of interests. One arresting strand is the promise that in a strong form - transdisciplinarity - 'science' might thereby be brought into 'society'.

It demonstrates some implications of an interactionist theory of action for extending still further the position represented by what has come to be called \"the negotiated-order approach\". After a deliberately autobiographical introduction to this Pragmatist-derived interactionist theory of action (acting), a lengthy list of assumptions behind that theory was presented. These assumptions are very useful for understanding the Chicago interactionist tradition as it has been influenced by Pragmatism, and lead to a theory of action. The book also includes discussion on work and its relations, the body, thought processes, symbolizing, social worlds and arenas, representation, the interplay of routine, and the relevance of the concept of social worlds and studying contemporary society.","author":[{"family":"Strauss","given":"Anselm L."},{"family":"Maines","given":"David R."}],"citation-key":"strauss1993","container-title":"Continual Permutations of Action","ISBN":"978-1-351-32856-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993"]]},"number-of-pages":"18","publisher":"Routledge","title":"Negotiated Order and Structural Ordering","type":"chapter"},
  {"id":"strauss2008","abstract":"Richard Bernstein expressed the view that pragmatism was ahead of its time; the same has been true of symbolic interactionism. These two closely related perspectives, one philosophical and the other sociological, place human action at the center of their explanatory schemes. It has not mattered what aspect of social or psychological behavior was under scrutiny. Whether selves, minds, or emotions, or institutions, social structures, or social change, all have been conceptualized as forms of human activity. This view is the simple genius of these perspectives. Anselm Strauss always took ideas pertaining to action and process seriously. Here he makes explicit the theory of action that implicitly guided his research for roughly forty years. It is understood that Strauss accepts the proposition that acting (or even better, interacting) causes social structure. He lays the basis for this idea in the nineteen assumptions he articulates early in the book--assumptions that elaborate and make clearer Herbert Blumer&#39;s famous premises of symbolic interactionism. The task Strauss put before himself is how to keep the complexity of human group life in front of the researcher/theorist and simultaneously articulate an analytical scheme that clarifies and reveals that complexity. With these two imperfectly related issues before him, Strauss outlines an analytical scheme of society in action. It is a scheme that rests not on logical necessity but on research and observation, and the concepts he uses are proposed because they do a certain amount of analytical work. One would be well advised to take Continual Permutations of Action very seriously. Anselm L. Strauss (1916-1996) was professor of sociology and chair of the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. His many books include Creating Sociological Awareness, Images of the American City, and Professions, Work, and Careers all available from Transaction. David R. Maines is professor and chair of sociology and anthropology at Oakland University.

Statistical studies of concentration data for six individual elements imply that obsidian from at least three sources (Güinope, La Esperanza, and Ixtepeque), and possibly two more (El Chayal and Otumba), was exploited in ancient times, but yield conflicting and ambiguous results for 5% of the collection. We argue that pXRF studies need to be conducted more critically and demonstrate how different statistical tools can yield contradictory source assignments for a significant portion of an obsidian collection. Visual sourcing supports discriminant function analysis over Mahalanobis distance assignments. Furthermore, element ratios imply that Otumba is not actually present. We are concerned that in obsidian studies, pXRF data are not consistently interpreted in ways that yield reproducible results.

  {"id":"struever1971","abstract":"The attempt to delineate the processes underlying cultural evolution has become a central problem for archaeology today. Yet, present attempts to explain prehistoric culture change are based on exceedingly fragmentary archeological evidence, a fact resulting partly from inappropriate research strategies and partly from the “one-man scholar” basis on which archaeological research has been traditionally organized.This paper shows that certain long-held assumptions about the nature of culture which have governed excavation strategy and methods limit the value of currently existing data for attacking processual questions. The paper also examines both the quality of archaeological data required for discovering evolutionary process and the research strategies necessary for recovering these data. It argues that these research strategies cannot be put into effect unless the scale of archaeological staff, facilities, and funding increases greatly, and equally important, unless the concept of how research is organized changes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Struever","given":"Stuart"}],"citation-key":"struever1971","container-title":"American Antiquity","DOI":"10.2307/278019","ISSN":"0002-7316, 2325-5064","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1971",1]]},"language":"en","page":"9-19","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Comments on Archaeological Data Requirements and Research strategy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/abs/comments-on-archaeological-data-requirements-and-research-strategy/9EE7E2977BE7FC53B829448B4CBE99FA","volume":"36"},

Starting from the premise that technologies can be assessed only in their relations to the sites of their production and use, the authors reconstruct technologies as social practice. A central problem for the design of artifacts then becomes their relation to the environments of their intended use. Through ethnographies of the social world, the analyses focus on just how social/material specificities are assembled together to comprise our everyday experience.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Suchman","given":"Lucy"},{"family":"Blomberg","given":"Jeanette"},{"family":"Orr","given":"Julian E."},{"family":"Trigg","given":"Randall"}],"citation-key":"suchman1999","container-title":"American Behavioral Scientist","container-title-short":"American Behavioral Scientist","DOI":"10.1177/00027649921955335","ISSN":"0002-7642","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"392-408","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Reconstructing Technologies as Social Practice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00027649921955335","volume":"43"},

The study of how new technologies emerge shifts, on this view, from a focus on invention to an interest in ongoing practices of assembly, demonstration, and performance. This view is developed in relation to the case of the ‘prototype’, an exploratory technology designed to effect alignment between the multiple interests and working practices of technology research and development, and sites of technologies-in-use. In so far as it is successful, the prototype works as an exemplary artefact that is at once intelligibly familiar to the actors involved, and recognizably new.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Suchman","given":"Lucy"},{"family":"Trigg","given":"Randall"},{"family":"Blomberg","given":"Jeanette"}],"citation-key":"suchman2002","container-title":"The British Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10.1080/00071310220133287","ISSN":"1468-4446","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"163-179","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Working artefacts: ethnomethods of the prototype","title-short":"Working artefacts","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1080/00071310220133287/abstract","volume":"53"},

  {"id":"sullivan2003","abstract":"Curation is rarely the first topic raised in an archaeological seminar or addressed in a fieldwork design. And, the authors point out, it is too rarely discussed at all. But the current crisis in repository space has increased awareness that the long-term conservation and preservation of the material remains and field notes of an archaeological project are as important as the finds themselves. Sullivan and Childs, two experienced archaeologists and museum professionals, provide an introductory guide to curation for archaeologists. Crucial to this process is the recognition of curation issues before the first day of fieldwork and continuous involvement of curators in the process throughout the archaeological project. The authors provide guidance on how to manage a collection, what to do with field notes and other project documents, how to find a repository for the collection, and how to adjust field practices so that the process runs smoothly. This brief, practical guide will be invaluable to all field archaeologists and their students, and to museum professionals who curate archaeological collections.","author":[{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Lynne P."},{"family":"Childs","given":"S.

In this paper, I consider two models of such practices; one that takes them to be reductive; another that takes them to be integrative. I investigate those areas of the neuroscience of learning and memory from which the examples used to substantiate these models are culled, and argue that the multiplicity of experimental protocols used in these research areas presents specific challenges for both models. In my view, these challenges have been overlooked largely because philosophers have hitherto failed to pay sufficient attention to fundamental features of experimental practice. I demonstrate that when we do pay attention to such features, evidence for reduction and integrative unity in neuroscience is simply not borne out. I end by suggesting some new directions for the philosophy of neuroscience that pertain to taking a closer look at the nature of neuroscientific experiments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Jacqueline A."}],"citation-key":"sullivan2009","container-title":"Synthese","container-title-short":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-008-9389-4","ISSN":"1573-0964","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"511-539","source":"Springer Link","title":"The multiplicity of experimental protocols: a challenge to reductionist and non-reductionist models of the unity of neuroscience","title-short":"The multiplicity of experimental protocols","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-008-9389-4","volume":"167"},

The result is that text and image poorly relate. But graphic formats that establish an interrelationship between text and image can be used to create new layers of richness.

In order to illustrate how the visualization principles of comics can be used to re-shape formal archaeological publication, the author presents an adaptation of the first three pages of “Ceramics and Polity” by Michael Whalen and Paul Minnis, originally published in American Antiquity. The use of similar visualization principles opens up the possibility of new kinds of professional, interdisciplinary, and peer-to-peer narratives.

  {"id":"taylor1995","abstract":"Sociological understanding of the professionalization process has largely depended upon 'inclusivist' analyses concentrating on identifying factors in differing professional settings. Following the lead of Robert Stebbings, an alternative approach is suggested, analysing the differences between professional approaches to work, and those implied by such terms as amateur, hobbyist and dilettanti. A particular focus on recurrent trends in histories of archaeology suggests that an evolutionary model whereby enthusiastic amateurs are supplanted by trained professionals is an empirically inadequate one. An alternative conceptualization is proposed, whereby amateurism is considered a self-legitimizing component of the vocabulary of professionalism itself.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Taylor","given":"Brian"}],"citation-key":"taylor1995","container-title":"The British Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10.2307/591853","ISSN":"0007-1315","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995"]]},"page":"499-508","source":"JSTOR","title":"Amateurs, Professionals and the Knowledge of Archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/591853","volume":"46"},

  {"id":"taylor2019","abstract":"Archaeological landscapes and environments are extremely complex and diverse systems. Vindolanda, situated in Northumberland, UK, is part of the Frontiers of the Roman Empire World Heritage site and has remarkable preservation of artefacts of international significance including leather, writing tablets and bones. Vindolanda is a waterlogged site and contains anoxic layers which, it is postulated, aids in the preservation of these important artefacts. The anoxic layers contain many chemical and microbiological properties which vary from context to context, depending on what remains in the soil and what is introduced into the archaeological environment through continued post-depositional processes. During excavations at Vindolanda, as at other sites the presence of a ‘blue substance’ has been noted by researchers for many years. This ‘blue substance’ has been generally described in the literature as Vivianite (hydrated iron (II) phosphate), and has speculatively been used as a signature of good organic preservation in archaeological contexts. In this paper, a range of analytical instrumentation SEM-EDX and XRD has been used to characterise the blue substance, taken from one well defined context to confirm as Vivianite (Fe3(PO4)2·8H2O).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Taylor","given":"G."},{"family":"Hefford","given":"R.

  {"id":"tema2019","abstract":"We present the results of a combined archaeomagnetic and thermoluminescence (TL) investigation on a baked clay kiln discovered near Santhià, Northern Italy. The site, brought to light during a rescue excavation for the installation of methane tubes, provides important evidence for the presence of a brick production workshop in the area. Standard thermal demagnetization was applied to isolate the direction of the Characteristic Remanent Magnetization (ChRM). The mean ChRM direction was used for the archaeomagnetic dating of the kiln, suggesting that it was abandoned around the 16th century CE. TL analysis carried out on the same kiln further confirms this dating. The comparison between the archaeomagnetic and TL results shows excellent agreement, underlining the great potential of these two techniques in dating baked clays. Moreover, thanks to the independent TL dating, the new archaeomagnetic data can be used as a reference point for the reconstruction of the past secular variation path in Italy. Such combined multidisciplinary dating is extremely important in the case of rescue excavations, particularly in urban centers where the rapid expansion of new constructions inevitably causes the destruction of our cultural heritage and the loss of important information about our past.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Tema","given":"Evdokia"},{"family":"Ferrara","given":"Enzo"},{"family":"Angelici","given":"Debora"},{"family":"Fantino","given":"Fulvio"},{"family":"Panero","given":"Elisa"}],"citation-key":"tema2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.102059","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"102059","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The importance of multidisciplinary dating in rescue excavations: The case of Santhià, Northern Italy","title-short":"The importance of multidisciplinary dating in rescue excavations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X19304651","volume":"28"},

Subsequent reanalysis of chert artifacts by ICP-MS demonstrates that data acquired using these techniques cannot be directly compared. ICP-MS trace element data collected from two primary chert sources documented in 2013 showed promise for characterizing these sources. Subsequent reanalysis of source samples demonstrates that initial results were affected by contamination during sample preparation at an external laboratory and should not be used in future studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bruggencate","given":"Rachel E.","non-dropping-particle":"ten"},{"family":"Milne","given":"S.

  {"id":"tennant2020","abstract":"There is no clear-cut boundary between Free and Open Source Software and Open Scholarship, and the histories, practices, and fundamental principles between the two remain complex. In this study, we critically appraise the intersections and differences between the two movements. Based on our thematic comparison here, we conclude several key things. First, there is substantial scope for new communities of practice to form within scholarly communities that place sharing and collaboration/open participation at their focus. Second, Both the principles and practices of FOSS can be more deeply ingrained within scholarship, asserting a balance between pragmatism and social ideology. Third, at the present, Open Scholarship risks being subverted and compromised by commercial players. Fourth, the shift and acceleration towards a system of Open Scholarship will be greatly enhanced by a concurrent shift in recognising a broader range of practices and outputs beyond traditional peer review and research articles. In order to achieve this, we propose the formulation of a new type of institutional mandate. We believe that there is substantial need for research funders to invest in sustainable open scholarly infrastructure, and the communities that support them, to avoid the capture and enclosure of key research services that would prevent optimal researcher behaviours. Such a shift could ultimately lead to a healthier scientific culture, and a system where competition is replaced by collaboration, resources (including time and people) are shared and acknowledged more efficiently, and the research becomes inherently more rigorous, verified, and reproducible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Tennant","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Agarwal","given":"Ritwik"},{"family":"Baždarić","given":"Ksenija"},{"family":"Brassard","given":"David"},{"family":"Crick","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Dunleavy","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"Evans","given":"Thomas Rhys"},{"family":"Gardner","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Gonzalez-Marquez","given":"Monica"},{"family":"Graziotin","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Tzovaras","given":"Bastian Greshake"},{"family":"Gunnarsson","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Havemann","given":"Johanna"},{"family":"Hosseini","given":"Mohammad"},{"family":"Katz","given":"Daniel S."},{"family":"Knöchelmann","given":"Marcel"},{"family":"Madan","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Manghi","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Marocchino","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Masuzzo","given":"Paola"},{"family":"Murray-Rust","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Narayanaswamy","given":"Sanjay"},{"family":"Nilsonne","given":"Gustav"},{"family":"Pacheco-Mendoza","given":"Josmel"},{"family":"Penders","given":"Bart"},{"family":"Pourret","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Rera","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Samuel","given":"John"},{"family":"Steiner","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Stojanovski","given":"Jadranka"},{"family":"Tirado","given":"Alejandro Uribe"},{"family":"Vos","given":"Rutger"},{"family":"Worthington","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Yarkoni","given":"Tal"}],"citation-key":"tennant2020","container-title":"SocArXiv","DOI":"10.31235/osf.io/2kxq8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,5]]},"language":"american","publisher":"SocArXiv","title":"A tale of two 'opens': Intersections between Free and Open Source Software and Open Scholarship","title-short":"A tale of two 'opens'","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2kxq8/"},
  {"id":"tenopir2011","abstract":"Background Scientific research in the 21st century is more data intensive and collaborative than in the past. It is important to study the data practices of researchers – data accessibility, discovery, re-use, preservation and, particularly, data sharing. Data sharing is a valuable part of the scientific method allowing for verification of results and extending research from prior results.   Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 1329 scientists participated in this survey exploring current data sharing practices and perceptions of the barriers and enablers of data sharing. Scientists do not make their data electronically available to others for various reasons, including insufficient time and lack of funding. Most respondents are satisfied with their current processes for the initial and short-term parts of the data or research lifecycle (collecting their research data; searching for, describing or cataloging, analyzing, and short-term storage of their data) but are not satisfied with long-term data preservation. Many organizations do not provide support to their researchers for data management both in the short- and long-term. If certain conditions are met (such as formal citation and sharing reprints) respondents agree they are willing to share their data. There are also significant differences and approaches in data management practices based on primary funding agency, subject discipline, age, work focus, and world region.   Conclusions/Significance Barriers to effective data sharing and preservation are deeply rooted in the practices and culture of the research process as well as the researchers themselves. New mandates for data management plans from NSF and other federal agencies and world-wide attention to the need to share and preserve data could lead to changes. Large scale programs, such as the NSF-sponsored DataNET (including projects like DataONE) will both bring attention and resources to the issue and make it easier for scientists to apply sound data management principles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Tenopir","given":"Carol"},{"family":"Allard","given":"Suzie"},{"family":"Douglass","given":"Kimberly"},{"family":"Aydinoglu","given":"Arsev Umur"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Read","given":"Eleanor"},{"family":"Manoff","given":"Maribeth"},{"family":"Frame","given":"Mike"}],"citation-key":"tenopir2011","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0021101","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",6,29]]},"page":"e21101","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Data Sharing by Scientists: Practices and Perceptions","title-short":"Data Sharing by Scientists","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021101","volume":"6"},

The implications of using this technology are mainly related to augmented and mixed reality applications, but its deployment for surveying tasks also seems promising. In particular, the potentialities of this miniaturized and low-cost sensor embedded in a mobile device have been assessed for documentation from the cultural heritage perspective—a domain where this solution may be particularly innovative. Over the last two years, an increasing number of mobile apps using the Apple LiDAR sensor for 3D data acquisition have been released. However, their performance and the 3D positional accuracy and precision of the acquired 3D point clouds have not yet been fully validated. Among the solutions available, as of September 2021, three iOS apps (SiteScape, EveryPoint, and 3D Scanner App) were tested. They were compared in different surveying scenarios, considering the overall accuracy of the sensor, the best acquisition strategies, the operational limitations, and the 3D positional accuracy of the final products achieved.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Teppati Losè","given":"Lorenzo"},{"family":"Spreafico","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Chiabrando","given":"Filiberto"},{"family":"Giulio Tonolo","given":"Fabio"}],"citation-key":"teppatilose2022","container-title":"Remote Sensing","container-title-short":"Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.3390/rs14174157","ISSN":"2072-4292","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,24]]},"language":"en","page":"4157","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Apple LiDAR Sensor for 3D Surveying: Tests and Results in the Cultural Heritage Domain","title-short":"Apple LiDAR Sensor for 3D Surveying","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/17/4157","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"thomas2016","abstract":"Since hosting its first archaeology fair in 2001, the Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) has organized 23 more fairs and informed thousands of people through this popular outreach activity. The AIA fair model brings together independent archaeological organizations representing a rich array of archaeological subfields to present their programs and resources to a local community in an interactive and engaging manner. The goals of AIA archaeology fairs are to promote a greater public understanding of archaeology, raise awareness of local archaeological resources, and bring together proximate archaeological groups with a shared outreach goal. In this article, the authors discuss how the AIA fair model was developed through feedback cycles that include evaluation, data analysis, reflection, and trial and error; how it evolved; and how it is spreading to other groups around the world. To date, 26 AIA local societies have hosted fairs, and the popularity of this program as an outreach event is increasing among other archaeological groups across the United States, as well as in Belize, Canada, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Iran, and Myanmar. This growth in popularity and implementation presents us with unique opportunities to collect and reflect upon data essential to conducting archaeological outreach around the globe.\n, \nResumen\nDesde su primera feria de arqueología en 2001, el Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) ha organizado un total de 23 ferias e informado a miles de personas de su compromiso a través de esta actividad.

  {"id":"thomson2014","abstract":"Archaeological collecting practices have created a predicament for museums and archaeological repositories that today is commonly referred to as the “curation crisis.” As new excavations continue to be organized each year, accumulated collections find themselves haphazardly stored in museums with few plans for their long-term management, care and preservation. While the existence of a “curation crisis” has been widely accepted in the United States since the 1970s, there is little agreement as to a solution that can be accomplished in a practical, affordable, and effective manner. As a consequence, it may take a long time for the crisis to be resolved.\nFocusing on American museums and archaeological repositories, this thesis will demonstrate that a well-developed collections management system provides one potential avenue to resolve the crisis by allowing museums to become better stewards and caretakers of their collections and by enabling them to advocate more cogently for their care and preservation. In the course of exploring its hypothesis, the thesis will offer suggestions as to how institutions managing archaeological collections can maximize the potential of specific collections management systems.","author":[{"family":"Thomson","given":"Karen"}],"citation-key":"thomson2014","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",5,1]]},"title":"Handling the “Curation Crisis:” Database Management for Archaeological Collections","title-short":"Handling the “Curation Crisis","type":"thesis","URL":"http://scholarship.shu.edu/dissertations/1970"},
  {"id":"thornton2018","abstract":"Archaeologists in Print is a history of popular publishing in archaeology in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, a pivotal period of expansion and development in both archaeology and publishing. It examines how British archaeologists produced books and popular periodical articles for a non-scholarly audience, and explores the rise in archaeologists’ public visibility. Notably, it analyses women’s experiences in archaeology alongside better known male contemporaries as shown in their books and archives. In the background of this narrative is the history of Britain’s imperial expansion and contraction, and the evolution of modern tourism in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East. Archaeologists exploited these factors to gain public and financial support and interest, and build and maintain a reading public for their work, supported by the seasonal nature of excavation and tourism. Reinforcing these publishing activities through personal appearances in the lecture hall, exhibition space and site tour, and in new media – film, radio and television – archaeologists shaped public understanding of archaeology. It was spadework, scripted.  The image of the archaeologist as adventurous explorer of foreign lands, part spy, part foreigner, eternally alluring, solidified during this period. That legacy continues, undimmed, today.Praise for Archaeologists in PrintThis beautifully written book will be valued by all kinds of readers: you don&#39;t need to be an archaeologist to enjoy the contents, which take you through different publishing histories of archaeological texts and the authors who wrote them. From the productive partnership of travel guide with archaeological interest, to the women who feature so often in the history of archaeological publishing, via closer analysis of the impact of John Murray, Macmillan and Co, and Penguin, this volume excavates layers of fascinating facts that reveal much of the wider culture of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The prose is clear and the stories compulsive: Thornton brings to life a cast of people whose passion for their profession lives again in these pages.  Warning: the final chapter, on Archaeological Fictions, will fill your to-be-read list with stacks of new titles to investigate!  This is a highly readable, accessible exploration into the dynamic relationships between academic authors, publishers, and readers. It is, in addition, an exemplar of how academic research can attract a wide general readership, as well as a more specialised one: a stellar combination of rigorous scholarship with lucid, pacy prose.

  {"id":"thum2016","abstract":"Brown University is home to several seldom-used study collections of broken and unprovenienced ancient Egyptian objects. In a new exhibition focused on the research process and the people who make it happen, these items feature as keys to the behind-the-scenes world of archaeological study. In this article, we demonstrate how educators can mobilize fragmentary artifacts as new tools for handson education. Each section of the exhibition focuses on an active research project that employs a modern investigative technology (e.g., XRF Analysis) and introduces visitors to researchers at all levels of study. This not only humanizes the archaeological process but also invites the viewer to participate actively in the interpretation of museum research. Two hands-on elements further cultivate an environment of accessibility to archaeology: an iPad interface updated regularly based on visitor feedback, which welcomes visitors to explore the exhibition’s objects and research technologies in greater depth; and a preexisting experiential learning program, CultureLab, where visitors can handle objects from the collection and be researchers themselves. Visitor feedback suggests that openly presenting the realities of archaeological research and subsequently encouraging visitors to assume the role of researcher is a highly effective model for visitors and educators alike.\n, \nResumen\nLa Universidad de Brown es el hogar de varias colecciones de estudio, las cuales aún no han sido analizadas y contienen objetos fragmentarios del antiguo Egipto con procedencia desconocida. Una nueva exposición se centró en el proceso de investigación y en las personas que lo hacen posible, mediante ella, estos artefactos nos revelan lo que ocurre tras bambalinas del mundo del estudio arqueológico. En este artículo se demuestra cómo los educadores pueden movilizar artefactos fragmentarios como nuevas herramientas para la educación interactiva. Cada sección de la exposición se centra en un proyecto de investigación activa que emplea una tecnología moderna de investigación (por ejemplo la espectroscopia de rayos X), y les presenta a los visitantes investigadores arqueológicos provenientes de todos los niveles de estudio. Esto no sólo humaniza el proceso arqueológico, sino también invita al espectador a participar activamente en la interpretación de la investigación museológica. Además, dos elementos prácticos en la exposición cultivan un medio ambiente accesible a la arqueología: una interfaz de iPad actualizada periódicamente a base de retroalimentación de los visitantes, que da la bienvenida a sus usuarios a explorar los objetos de la exposición y tecnologías de investigación con mayor profundidad; y un programa preexistente del aprendizaje experiencial, CultureLab, donde los visitantes pueden manejar objetos de la colección y realizar sus propias investigaciones. El incorporar inmediatamente la opinión de los visitantes supone que presentando abiertamente las realidades de la investigación arqueológica, se anima a los visitantes a asumir el papel de investigadores, creando un modelo muy eficaz de enseñanza para ambos, visitantes y educadores.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Thum","given":"Jen"},{"family":"Troche","given":"Julia"}],"citation-key":"thum2016","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.7183/2326-3768.4.4.537","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11]]},"language":"en","page":"537-549","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Visitor as Researcher: Making Archaeology More Accessible with Broken and Unprovenienced Objects","title-short":"Visitor as Researcher","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/visitor-as-researcher/B5AA294CB94952637F8830AF17916E95","volume":"4"},

This creates a conflict between what is best for scientists’ careers and what is best for science. In this article, we show how the theory of multilevel selection provides conceptual tools for modifying incentives to better align individual and collective interests. A core principle is the need to account for indirect effects by shifting the level at which selection operates from individuals to the groups in which individuals are embedded. This principle is used in several fields to improve collective outcomes, including animal husbandry, team sports, and professional organizations. Shifting the level of selection has the potential to ameliorate several problems in contemporary science, including accounting for scientists’ diverse contributions to knowledge generation, reducing individual-level competition, and promoting specialization and team science.

Rooted in software culture and carrying more than a whiff of Silicon Valley technical utopianism, openness—of decision-making, data, and organizational structure—is seen as the cure for many problems in politics and business.   But what does openness mean, and what would a political theory of openness look like? With Wikipedia and the Politics of Openness, Nathaniel Tkacz uses Wikipedia, the most prominent product of open organization, to analyze the theory and politics of openness in practice—and to break its spell. Through discussions of edit wars, article deletion policies, user access levels, and more, Tkacz enables us to see how the key concepts of openness—including collaboration, ad-hocracy, and the splitting of contested projects through “forking”—play out in reality.   The resulting book is the richest critical analysis of openness to date, one that roots media theory in messy reality and thereby helps us move beyond the vaporware promises of digital utopians and take the first steps toward truly understanding what openness does, and does not, have to offer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Tkacz","given":"Nathaniel"}],"citation-key":"tkacz2014","event-place":"Chicago, IL","ISBN":"978-0-226-19230-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",12]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"232","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","publisher-place":"Chicago, IL","source":"University of Chicago Press","title":"Wikipedia and the Politics of Openness","type":"book","URL":"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo19085555.html"},

The databases created for hosting the surrogates are designed for different categories of audience, with various standards in mind and different levels of technical sophistication. Although primarily accessed for the texts they bear, the digital surrogates of manuscripts are also the object of study of a specialized group of users interested in their physical features. This review will discuss whether databases that comprise digital surrogates of Greek New Testament manuscripts built by different types of institutions are efficient in addressing the needs of this admittedly small audience. I examine questions of content, interface, organization, and rationales behind the choices of their creators.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Toumpouri","given":"Marina"}],"citation-key":"toumpouri2019a","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2019.12","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8]]},"language":"English","page":"324–324","title":"Databases for Specialized Audiences: An Exploration of Online Access to the Nontextual Features of Greek New Testament Manuscripts – ADDENDUM","title-short":"Databases for Specialized Audiences","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/databases-for-specialized-audiences-an-exploration-of-online-access-to-the-nontextual-features-of-greek-new-testament-manuscripts-addendum/892A79FAA5A325F70268B19413374CF9","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"toyne2018","abstract":"Most archaeological practice involves horizontal excavations of ancient occupations and cemeteries, but the Chachapoya of Peru's eastern montane built tombs along narrow cliff ledges, which require innovative methods of investigation. Many of these sites are becoming exposed and threatened due to increased deforestation. The La Petaca mortuary complex includes 125 constructed platforms, modified ledges, mausoleums, and caves containing human remains across one section of an exposed rock face approximately 200 m across by approximately 80 m high. While the site has been looted and damaged due to various taphonomic processes (including ecological, geological, and cultural), we argue that there are recoverable details, especially in relation to how the ancient Chachapoya people created and accessed these vertical spaces. Through collaboration with technical professionals, we identified and documented many tombs using vertical progression techniques. This valuable partnership between spelunkers and archaeologists allowed us to develop techniques for “vertical archaeology,” including safe access in order to be able to document, sample, and make detailed observations of building methods and burial contents., La mayoría de los cementerios antiguos se encuentran en emplazamientos sin dificultad de acceso, donde se excavaron tumbas para depositar los restos mortuorios. Sin embargo, los Chachapoyas de la región serrana oriental del Perú construyeron sus tumbas en acantilados escarpados de muy difícil acceso. Muchos de estos sitios están expuestos y en peligro a causa de la creciente deforestación. En el complejo mortuorio de La Petaca encontramos 125 mausoleos y cuevas con restos humanos, conectados entre sí por medio de plataformas construidas en madera y salientes rocosos modificados. La Petaca ocupa un área de más de 200 metros de longitud por 80 metros de altura de la sección de un acantilado muy expuesto de roca caliza. A pesar de que el sitio arqueológico ha sido saqueado y dañado debido a diversos procesos tafonómicos (incluyendo procesos ecológicos, geológicos y culturales), sostenemos que hay datos recuperables utilizando técnicas especializadas. A través de la colaboración con técnicos de acceso y posicionamiento con cuerdas, hemos podido acceder e identificar muchas de las construcciones. Esta valiosa alianza entre arqueólogos y técnicos de acceso por cuerdas ha permitido desarrollar la especialidad de una arqueología en espacios verticales. Esta comprende, entre otras cosas, temas relacionados con la elección de anclajes que causan un mínimo impacto en estos emplazamientos tan sensibles y el acceso y posicionamiento seguro para que los técnicos e investigadores puedan llevar a cabo sus trabajos de mapeo, tomar muestras y realizar observaciones detalladas tanto de las técnicas arquitectónicas como de los contenidos de las tumbas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Toyne","given":"J.

  {"id":"traveallepuz2020","abstract":"Building upon the concepts of constructed past theory, this paper introduces the outcome of ontology-mediated data modeling developed by the authors within the last 15 years. Assuming that the past is something constructed through reflection of former times, one of our major concerns is guaranteeing the traceability of the construction process of an integrated historical discourse built from all available sources of information, regardless of their origin or nature. Therefore, by means of defining key concepts such as ‘unit of topography’ and ‘actor’, we created an information system for data gathering and exploitation and applied it to some experiences of construction of the past. When applied within the archaeological domain, the result is an archaeological information system interoperable with other sources of historical information. Its strength is that it ensures the traceability of the process from the beginning avoiding the introduction and repetition of errors within the system. Along with the main case example developed in this paper, we also summarize some other data modeling examples within the same conceptual framework.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Travé Allepuz","given":"Esther"},{"family":"Fresno Bernal","given":"Pablo","non-dropping-particle":"del"},{"family":"Mauri Martí","given":"Alfred"}],"citation-key":"traveallepuz2020","container-title":"Information","container-title-short":"Information","DOI":"10.3390/info11040182","ISSN":"2078-2489","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,28]]},"language":"en","page":"182","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ontology-Mediated Historical Data Modeling: Theoretical and Practical Tools for an Integrated Construction of the Past","title-short":"Ontology-Mediated Historical Data Modeling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/11/4/182","volume":"11"},

Now, in this new edition, he both updates the original work and introduces new archaeological perspectives and concerns. At once stimulating and even-handed, it places the development of archaeological thought and theory throughout within a broad social and intellectual framework. The successive but interacting trends apparent in archaeological thought are defined and the author seeks to determine the extent to which these trends were a reflection of the personal and collective interests of archaeologists as these relate - in the West at least - to the fluctuating fortunes of the middle classes. While subjective influences have been powerful, Professor Trigger argues that the gradual accumulation of archaeological data has exercised a growing constraint on interpretation. In turn, this has increased the objectivity of archaeological research and enhanced its value for understanding the entire span of human history and the human condition in general.","author":[{"family":"Trigger","given":"Bruce G."}],"citation-key":"trigger2006","ISBN":"978-1-107-71762-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",9,11]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"35","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"A History of Archaeological Thought","type":"book"},

  {"id":"tringham2000","abstract":"Published in 2000 in I. Hodder (ed.) Towards Reflexive Methodology in Archaeology Cambridge: McDonal Institute for Archaeology The aim of this paper is to point out that important contextual variables occur in the process of retrieval of the archaeological materials through excavation. The excavation methodology at Çatalhöyük has tended to be treated in the literature (Hodder 1997) as relatively uniform. We shall show, however, that there are in fact multiple excavation methodologies. This has been implied in an earlier chapter in this volume (Farid et al.) in which the excavation strategy and opinions of the British team excavating at Çatalhöyük are voiced. This chapter will draw attention to the voices of the other excavation teams at Çatalhöyük, specifically the \"American\" and the \"Greek\" teams. Joan Gero has demonstrated the nature of some of the variability of excavation strategies along gendered and regional lines (Gero 1996). Farid et al have also suggested that regional variability is present by referring to the \"American team\" and the \"Greek team\". In this chapter, however, we are interested in exploring some of the interesting implications and complexities of training, organization, status/power that, to a certain extent, are the result of regional methodologies, but are also the result, I believe, of variation in the field experience and intellectual histories of the individual researchers. Joan Gero (Gero 1996) and Margaret Conkey (Conkey 1997) have both set these implications of the \"constituting context\" for the practice and routines of archaeological research in a more theoretical context than we shall do here. Is the BACH team American? Mirjana Stevanovic and Ruth Tringham -who together direct the Berkeley Archaeologists at Çatalhöyük (BACH team, or \"the American team\") -through working together for fifteen years in Yugoslavia and Bulgaria have developed a strategy which was designed to retrieve information on the use-lives of Neolithic houses (Stevanovic and Tringham 1998). Neolithic houses in Southeast and Central Europe are rectangular detached houses of wattle-and-daub with a gabled roof. In Southeast Europe these are universally burned at the end of their use-lives.","author":[{"family":"Tringham","given":"Ruth"},{"family":"Stevanovic","given":"Mirjana"}],"citation-key":"tringham2000","container-title":"Towards reflexive method in archaeology: the example at Çatalhöyük by members of the  Çatalhöyük teams","editor":[{"family":"Hodder","given":"Ian"}],"event-place":"Cambridge","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"page":"111-118","publisher":"McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Different Excavation Styles create Different Windows into Çatalhöyük","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"tringham2019","abstract":"This article describes a path to addressing the discomfort that I and many of my braver colleagues have had, when putting words into the mouths and heads of prehistoric actors, knowing that these words say more about us than they do about prehistory. Yet without such speech, how are we archaeologists and the broader public to imagine the intangibles of the deep past (emotions, affect, gender, senses)? Moreover, such words create a misleading certainty that conceals the ambiguities of the archaeological data. Are there alternative options to verbal and vocal clarity when creating imagined fictive narratives about the past? With inspiration from composer Györgi Ligeti, from linguists and experimental psychologists, and from ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) performers, I explore the emotive power of vocal non-verbal interjections and utterances that have more universality and less cultural baggage, using them in three diverse re-mediations of digital media from three prehistoric archaeological contexts in Europe and Anatolia., Le chemin parcouru pour surmonter la gêne ressentie par moi-même et maints collègues plus courageux quand il s'agit de mettre des mots dans la bouche et la tête de personnages préhistoriques, sachant bien que ces mots en disent plus sur nous que sur la préhistoire, forme le sujet de cet article. Mais s'ils restent muets, comment les archéologues et le grand public peuvent-ils imaginer les aspects intangibles d'un passé très ancien (sentiments, émotions, genre, sens) ? En outre, ces mots créent un climat de certitude trompeuse qui masque les ambigüités des données archéologiques. Existe-t-il des alternatives aux paroles trop précises quand on tente d'imaginer des récits fictifs situés dans le passé ? En m'inspirant du compositeur Györgi Ligeti, des travaux de linguistes et de chercheurs en psychologie expérimentale, et de praticiens de l'ASMR (Réponse Automatique des Méridiens Sensoriels), j'examine ici le pouvoir émotionnel de la voix dans ses interjections et expressions non verbales de caractère plus universel et moins chargées de bagage culturel. Je présente ainsi trois essais de re-création numérique illustrant trois situations préhistoriques provenant de contextes archéologiques en Europe et en Anatolie.

Aber wie können sich die Archäologen und die breite Öffentlichkeit die immateriellen Aspekte der tiefen Vergangenheit (wie Gefühle, Gemütsbewegungen, Geschlecht oder die Sinne) ohne Sprache vorstellen? Darüber hinaus geben solche Aussagen einen falschen Eindruck, der klarer als die unbestimmten Angaben der archäologischen Daten ist.

Vom Komponisten Györgi Ligeti inspiriert und von den Arbeiten von Sprachwissenschaftler und experimenteller Psychologen sowie Praktikern der sogenannten Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) angeregt, untersuche ich die emotionale Kraft von nonverbalen Ausrufen und Äußerungen, die eher einen allgemeingültigen Charakter haben und weniger kulturell geprägt sind.

  {"id":"trinkl2017","abstract":"To the fundamental paper of Sir John Beazley in 1929 we owe the classification of Attic head vases of archaic/classical time. He categorized the vases in the form of human heads in twenty groups and a miscellaneous list, according to the depicted figure and the stylistic development of the face. The vast majority of the Attic pottery was thrown by the potter's wheel. Concerning the head vases, the potters used the same technique only for the upper part of the vessel whereas the head of the head vase was made by two moulds, one for the face and a second for the rear. This process of production interconnects head vases and terracotta figurines. Dealing with coroplastic workshops the issue of original model, moulding, and reused moulds was always raised. Due to the comparable production process, we will raise similar questions in connection with the head vases in our paper. Physical, chemical and petrographic analysis has already been established in the pottery research, we will present an autonomous method for the documentation and evaluation of the shape based on 3D models and will describe a case study for the analysis. On a computerized basis, the quantitative comparison of the faces of the head vases may be executed systematically, regardless of the secondary painted decoration of the face (often even revised in modern times) and the location of storage. These methods do not affect the original material in any way. The face of the head vases originally drawn from a negative form is recorded by a 3D scan which can secure the accurate geometry. 3D shape comparison based on scanned surface geometry of the heads was performed. The geometry of the faces is compared to each other and a series of interdependent productions can be established based on the geometry. This provides to us information about the relative chronology of the vessels which may finally be interwoven with the absolute chronology. In total, based on objective criteria we search for common moulds to update Beazley's stylistically made classification.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Trinkl","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Rieke-Zapp","given":"Dirk"},{"family":"Homer","given":"Lewis"}],"citation-key":"trinkl2017","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2017.07.023","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10,12]]},"source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Face to face – Considering the moulding of Attic head vases reconsidering Beazley's groups by quantitative analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X17305345"},

This article reviews two trajectories of matsutake research, showing how distinctive regional nodes may develop within a cosmopolitan modern science. The global center of matsutake research is in Japan, where problems of artificial cultivation and the \"orchard-style\" enhancement of production under forest conditions stimulate basic research. U.S. Pacific Northwest research forms a contrasting regional node, with a focus on sustainable yields in the context of timber production. Regional differences in research design and results point to the importance of distinctive scientific legacies, in this case formed in relation to divergent histories of forest management. Attention to regional distinctions in the framing of scientific problems is particularly important as scientific frameworks are exported to new places; for example, both Japanese and American forms of matsutake science have been extended to China. /// マツタケ科学にみる書林聾理の多樺化について高価なグルメきのこであるマツタケと その近晶君重群のTrich olαna属は広範囲に渡る科学的研究の対象となってきた。本論では 二つの地域特徴的なマツタケ研究の軌跡を概観し、文化的差異を超えて世界的に通用す る近代科学においても地域固有の関心に応じて特徴のある知識が結節し発展することを 示す。マツタケ研究の世界的な中心地である日本では人工増殖やマツタケを殖やすため の「果樹園的』な山林作りへの関心が基礎研究の方向性に刺激を与えてきた。一方日本 とは対照的に、米国北西岸州では木材の持続的産出に主眼をおいた山林管理の流れの中 で研究が進んできた。こうした研究計画や結果的に得られる知識の違いは、地域ごとに 特徴のある科学的遺産ー本件の場合は森林管理の歴史が多様に枝分かれしていることー に注目することが重要であることを知らせてくれる。近年日本や米国で発展したマツタ ケ研究の方法や成巣が中国での研究にも影響を与えているが、特に新しい研究の場を広 げる場合には科学的な関心、問題がどのような枠組で組み立てられるか地域によって多 様であることを考慮することが重要である。","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Tsing","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Satsuka","given":"Shiho"}],"citation-key":"tsing2008","container-title":"Economic Botany","DOI":"10.2307/40390461","ISSN":"0013-0001","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"page":"244-253","source":"JSTOR","title":"Diverging Understandings of Forest Management in Matsutake Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/40390461","volume":"62"},

  {"id":"tykot2017a","abstract":"Abstract\n            Obsidian sourcing studies have been conducted in the central Mediterranean for more than 50 years. Detailed studies have been done on the geological sources on four Italian islands, and many analytical methods have been used to successfully distinguish between them. The ability to conduct analyses using those minimally (LA-ICP-MS) or totally (XRF, pXRF) non-destructive to artifacts has led to >10,000 analyses just in the last decade. Along with the ability to assign artifacts to specific geological subsources, and an increased number of studies of techno-typology, this has allowed interpretations to be made about source access and territorial control, craft specialization and the chaîne opératoire, as well as the modes, frequency, and directions of movement and how that varied spacially and temporally. Obsidian especially from Lipari and from Monte Arci in Sardinia traveled hundreds of kilometers on a regular basis starting in the Early Neolithic. By the Late Neolithic, in some areas there was selection of specific obsidian sources and subsources, and differences in production methods and tool typology. Obsidian distribution and usage in the central Mediterranean continued over four-and-one-half millennia, in many areas well into the Bronze Age. There is much more still to do integrating these different studies, especially use-wear studies, along with those of lithic and other materials that also played a role in prehistoric transport and trade systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Tykot","given":"Robert H."}],"citation-key":"tykot2017a","container-title":"Open Archaeology","DOI":"10.1515/opar-2017-0018","ISSN":"2300-6560","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10,26]]},"source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Obsidian Studies in the Prehistoric Central Mediterranean: After 50 Years, What Have We Learned and What Still Needs to Be Done?","title-short":"Obsidian Studies in the Prehistoric Central Mediterranean","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/doi/10.1515/opar-2017-0018","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"tzouganatou2018","abstract":"In the digital age, cultural organizations strive to retain audience engagement especially via experimentation with novel technologies and social media. The latter are increasingly influencing the way cultural heritage is perceived, providing options for grappling with crucial issues in the sector, including sustainability, openness, and public participation. One tool that has been deployed to explore these issues is the chatbot, a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the internet. Chatbots run through different conversational interfaces, but they have a particularly heavy application in Facebook Messenger. Within the museums and cultural sector specifically, these robotic media are regularly proclaimed to offer novel engagement mechanisms that can empower participants to actively participate in the heritage process. However, most heritage Messenger bots are purely informative and object- or exhibit-centered, providing little opportunity for meaningful interactivity, creative expression, or critical engagement. This article explores and critically reviews three Messenger chatbots related to heritage organizations, concluding with suggestions for their future development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Tzouganatou","given":"Angeliki"}],"citation-key":"tzouganatou2018","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2018.32","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11]]},"language":"en","page":"377-383","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Can Heritage Bots Thrive?

  {"id":"ullah2015","abstract":"The data from older archaeological surveys are incredibly important resources, often containing our only information about sites that have been destroyed or that are now inaccessible. These surveys occurred before the advent of GPS technology, however, so their spatial accuracy is often uncertain. Many types of locational errors accumulate in such “legacy” datasets, so using them in modern GIS-based spatial analyses is frequently problematic. Many of the sources of error can be identified and quantified, however, and systematic and random errors (derived mainly from Cartesian, rounding, and human error) can largely be mitigated by scanning the original field maps, georectifying the maps to trusted imagery, and then digitizing sites directly. The remaining “mislocation” errors derive from difficulty identifying locations in the field. The original survey notes may contain clues about mislocation error, but it is impossible to mitigate these errors without re-recording site locations with more accurate survey instruments. Instead, I advocate the use of GIS-based models to estimate the influence of specific surveying practices on site location accuracy. These models can provide a standardized, quantifiable measure of mislocation error in a legacy dataset, which can help guide its use in modern GIS analyses that require accurate site locations.\n, \nLos datos de prospecciones arqueológicas antiguas son recursos de una enorme importancia, pues contienen a menudo la única información disponible sobre yacimientos que han sido destruidos, o que resultan inaccesibles en la actualidad. Sin embargo, estas prospecciones tuvieron lugar antes de la llegada de la tecnología GPS, por lo que su precisión espacial es a menudo incierta. Los tipos de errores de localización que se acumulan en este tipo de datos “heredados” son numerosos, por lo que su uso en análisis espaciales modernos basados en SIG es, con frecuencia, problemático. No obstante, muchas de las causas de estos errores pueden ser identificadas y cuantificadas y, tanto los errores sistemáticos como aleatorios (derivados principalmente del Cartesiano, el redondeo y los errores humanos), pueden ser mitigados en gran medida por medio del escaneo de los mapas de campo originales, su georrectificado a partir de imágenes de confianza, y la posterior digitalización de los sitios. Los restantes “errores de ubicación” tienen su origen en la dificultad a la hora de situar los puntos en el campo. Los diarios y anotaciones originales de las prospecciones pueden contener pistas sobre dichos errores de ubicación, pero resulta imposible mitigar su efecto sin volver a registrar las ubicaciones de los yacimientos con instrumentos más precisos. En su lugar, yo abogo por el uso de modelos basados en SIG para estimar la influencia de determinados métodos específicos de exploración en la precisión de la localización de los sitios. Estos modelos pueden proporcionar una medida estandarizada, cuantificable de los errores de ubicación en un conjunto de datos heredado, lo que puede ayudar a guiar su uso en los análisis modernos de SIG, que requieren ubicaciones exactas de los yacimientos.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Ullah","given":"Isaac I.

  {"id":"ullah2024","abstract":"Geographic information systems (GIS) has been used in archaeology for four decades, and colloquially appears to have become a main tool in the geospatial aspects of archaeological practice. In this paper, we examine temporal trends in the use and/or mention of GIS in archaeological publications (books and journal articles), conference presentations, and websites. We gathered data through keyword searches and with formal sampling surveys and conducted both quantitative and qualitative analyses to characterize the changing nature and intensity of GIS use in archaeology over time, and then contextualize these trends with a narrative history of archaeological GIS. We show how archaeological GIS-use has grown from a few early adopters of the 1980s, through a slow initial integration phase in the 1990s, to a set of two major expansions in the 2000s and 2010s. While we find that applied use of GIS has grown to the point where it can be considered ubiquitous—if not completely universal—in the discipline, we also discovered that the major focus in archaeological GIS advancement is methodological rather than theoretical. We identify five roadblocks that we believe have hampered the development of a theory-rich archaeological GIS: (1) deficiencies in the archaeological GIS education model, (2) over-reliance on commercial software, (3) technical/technological barriers, (4) gaps in acceptance of GIS, and (5) the perception of GIS as “just a tool.” We offer initial suggestions for ways forward to mitigate the effects of these roadblocks and build a more robust, theoretically sophisticated relationship with GIS in archaeology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ullah","given":"Isaac I."},{"family":"Clow","given":"Zachery"},{"family":"Meling","given":"Juliette"}],"citation-key":"ullah2024","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-023-09638-1","ISSN":"1573-7764","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1185-1231","source":"Springer Link","title":"Paradigm or Practice?

  {"id":"vandam2019","abstract":"Kuruçay Höyük can be considered a key site for our understanding of Late Prehistory in southwest Turkey and above all, the poorly known Late Chalcolithic (4200–3100 b.c.). Until now, limited research has been conducted on the relationship between the excavated site and its surrounding. This article discusses the Late Chalcolithic results of an integrated survey in the vicinity of Kuruçay Höyük in the Burdur Plain. Drawing upon these results, this paper illustrates that the site was far from an isolated feature during the 4th millennium b.c. The picture that emerges is one of a differentiated settlement system consisting of both larger höyük/tell settlements (like Kuruçay Höyük) and smaller sized, possibly short-lived, flat settlements. These results are further contextualized within the developments that took place in the region during the Chalcolithic, which seem to have opened the door for communities to become more complex during the Early Bronze Age.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Vandam","given":"Ralf"},{"family":"Mušič","given":"Branko"},{"family":"Medarić","given":"Igor"}],"citation-key":"vandam2019","container-title":"Journal of Field Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00934690.2018.1558904","ISSN":"0093-4690","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,2]]},"page":"1-18","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Contextualizing Kuruçay Höyük: Assessing the Unexplored Late Chalcolithic Landscape Near the Beginning of Early Social Complexity in SW Turkey","title-short":"Contextualizing Kuruçay Höyük","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00934690.2018.1558904","volume":"44"},

Although the typical university in its mission statement claims to aspire outstanding quality, academic freedom, and to contribute to society, in its daily organization, the modern university has normalized and internalized a neoliberal metrical governmentality, in which quality, freedom, and societal benefit risk being exchanged for quantity, managerial control, and status benefit. In this essay, we stand up against this worrying self-harming protection strategy, what we term—following Jacques Derrida—the autoimmunity of the university.

We discuss the collaborative development, implementation, and evaluation of the PAZC Ceramics module in the FAIMS Mobile platform. Our deployment of the module yielded significant improvements in the efficiency of data collection, as well as reduced numbers of missing fields and higher user satisfaction scores. However, it did not improve data consistency between users and yielded a classificatory system that was somewhat more challenging to update than our previous mode of operation. These results underscore some of the trade-offs that may be entailed in employing mobile technologies for archaeological applications and highlight the ways in which specific media configurations impact the production of archaeological knowledge., En este artículo, examinamos las posibilidades y desafíos que presenta la computación móvil para una actividad fundamental de la investigación arqueológica —el análisis tipológico de la cerámica.

Unlike traditional airborne remote sensing, drone lidar produces very high-density measurements at a wide range of scan angles by operating at low altitudes and slow flight speeds. These measurements can resolve near vertical surfaces and novel dimensions of variability in architectural datasets. We show in a case study at Kuelap that the number of detected structures almost exactly matches the number reported from previous ground level surveys, and we use these data to quantify the relative circularity and size frequency distribution of architectural structures. We demonstrate variability in domestic architecture that was obscured in previous models produced using low-resolution remote sensing.

Aerial data collected from satellite-, airborne- and UAV-mounted sensors have been particularly transformational, allowing us to capture more sites and features, over larger areas, at greater resolution, and in formerly inaccessible landscapes. However, these new means of collecting, processing, and visualizing datasets also present fresh challenges for archaeologists. What kinds of questions are these methods suited to answer, and where do they fall short? How do they articulate with the work of collecting smaller scale and lower resolution data? How are our relationships with “local” communities impacted by working at the scales of entire provinces, nation-states, and continents? This themed issue seeks to foster a conversation about how the unprecedented expansion of archaeological site detection, the globalization of archaeological data structures and databases, and the use of high-resolution aerial datasets are changing both the way archaeologists envision the past and the way we work in the present. In our introduction to the issue, presented here, we outline a series of conceptual and ethical issues posed by big data approaches in archaeology and provide an overview of how the nine essays that comprise this volume each address them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Valkenburgh","given":"Parker","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Dufton","given":"J.

  {"id":"vaquero2018","abstract":"A quick glance at the evolution of lithic assemblages throughout prehistory highlights a great variability in the time and effort invested in technological activities. This variability has been related to differences in the technological organization of human groups, giving rise to the distinction proposed by Binford between curated and expedient technologies. Curation has been the subject of much discussion with regard to its definition and archaeological implications, but expediency has received comparatively less interest from researchers. Nevertheless, expedient technologies are ubiquitous in the archaeological record and represent a large proportion of prehistoric lithic assemblages, even becoming clearly dominant in certain chronological and/or regional contexts. The aim of this paper is to characterize expedient technologies as low-cost strategies that can be identified in all the stages of the lithic production sequence, from raw material provisioning to tool manufacture. However, we will focus our attention on core reduction technologies, emphasizing the consequences of distinguishing between expedient and formal reduction strategies. Finally, some implications of expediency in archaeological interpretation will be discussed, focusing on the significance of expedient technologies in the cultural ascription of lithic assemblages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Vaquero","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Romagnoli","given":"Francesca"}],"citation-key":"vaquero2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-017-9339-x","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"334-367","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Searching for Lazy People: the Significance of Expedient Behavior in the Interpretation of Paleolithic Assemblages","title-short":"Searching for Lazy People","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-017-9339-x","volume":"25"},
  {"id":"varela2014","abstract":"This article discusses the effectiveness of Mexico’s national heritage business model within a context of economic growth, infrastructure development, and structural shifts that pose risks to the preservation of heritage resources. To meet these challenges, the future heritage professional requires a training profile that most archaeology departments in Mexico are unable to accommodate. Recognizing the importance of cultural resources management (CRM) and heritage business and marketing skills, the BA program in Development and Intercultural Management, offered at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, is exploring new ways to create business models to finance heritage preservation. In an emergent economy, many students lack the opportunity to pursue higher education degrees, joining the labor market at a very early stage in their careers, without much knowledge of how to make heritage a lever for economic growth. Thus, a goal of this article is to encourage the early teaching of business and marketing in programs around the world by demonstrating how such training opportunities are opening up unimaginable career avenues for the future heritage professional in Mexico.\n, \nEn las siguientes páginas se analiza la efectividad del modelo nacional de preservación del patrimonio cultural para enfrentar el crecimiento económico de México.

Al reconocer la importancia de la administración de recursos culturales y la necesidad de generar habilidades en torno a la administración de negocios y mercadotecnia, la Licenciatura en Desarrollo y Gestión Interculturales que ofrece la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México introduce una nueva forma de pensar en el futuro profesionista, que le permite crear nuevos modelos de negocios para financiar la preservación del patrimonio cultural. En las economías emergentes, los estudiantes no siempre tienen la oportunidad de estudiar posgrados y se unen al mercado laboral sin saber como transformar al patrimonio cultural en una herramienta de crecimiento económico.

However, much of the site remains unexplored, leaving many questions unanswered about the location of dense archaeological deposits, the nature of urban organization, and water management strategies—specifically those located in the eastern sector of the Akapana Pyramid. Orthophoto mosaics and Digital Elevation Models derived from drone imagery helped identify archaeological features and anthropogenic mounds. New magnetic survey produced with a cesium gradiometer was merged with previous surveys (fluxgate and cesium gradiometer). The integration of maps and plans from six areas of a previous archaeological investigation within a common Geographical Information System helped relate geophysical anomalies to archaeological features. Our results demonstrate a high level of urban organization associating monumental buildings to open ritual spaces and to densely populated areas during Tiwanaku IV (500–800 CE) and V (800–1100 CE). The complexity of the urban organization is also demonstrated by landscape modifications such as a complex water management system and at least three terraces that augmented the monumentality of the Akapana Pyramid This interdisciplinary approach, innovative in Bolivia, provides new insight into one of the most significant archaeological sites in the Andes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Vella","given":"M. -A."},{"family":"Ernenwein","given":"E.

  {"id":"venditti2019","abstract":"Revadim is a multi-layered Late Acheulian site in the Levant which has yielded rich lithic assemblages comprising dozens of handaxes, as well as many thousands of other items, mostly flakes. The techno-functional study presented here focuses on Layer C3, the densest layer at the site in terms of flint artefacts and animal bones. The lithic assemblage is characterized by an intense production of flakes, including a specific lithic recycling trajectory oriented towards the production of small flakes from existing flakes (Cores-On-Flakes). In this study, two categories of artefacts are sampled: the flakes used as cores for the production of new blanks (termed here COF-FFs) and the small flakes produced from them (termed BPFCs or products of recycling). Use-wear analysis conducted mainly at a low magnification, combined with residue analysis and a typo-technological characterization of the artefacts demonstrated that the small flakes produced from these COF-FFs were the desired end-products of this lithic trajectory, with a rather high percentage of used items while the COFs were rarely used, confirming their role as cores. The characterization of the used edges suggests a correlation between the activities performed and the different types of small flakes produced. Our results demonstrate the existence of a well-defined link between small flakes form and functionality, highlighting the capability of the Revadim Lower Paleolithic hominins to produce artifacts with pre-determined size, morphology, and specific utilizable edge features, suitable for the execution of anticipated targeted tasks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Venditti","given":"Flavia"},{"family":"Agam","given":"Aviad"},{"family":"Barkai","given":"Ran"}],"citation-key":"venditti2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.102039","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"102039","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Techno-functional analysis of small recycled flakes from Late Acheulian Revadim (Israel) demonstrates a link between morphology and function","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X19304183","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"verhoeven2017","abstract":"In various disciplines, particularly those that utilise techniques developed in the geosciences, the display, analysis and interpretation of three-dimensional (3D) data is very important. This is also the case in archaeology. Irrespective of a site- or landscape-centred point of focus, archaeology deals with very complex surfaces and always examines traces of past human presence in three geometrical dimensions. Visualising these detailed geometric environments is not that much of an issue anymore; however, interactively interpreting and mapping them is still problematic. Despite the steady increase in technologies to create 3D models, there is still a serious lack of tools that allow for easy interaction with these models in a metrical and coordinate system-aware environment. As a result, most—if not all—interpretation workflows will first downscale 3D data to two-and-a-half-dimensional (2.5D) or 2D data sets, thus effectively discarding up to one geometrical dimension. To enable or enhance the perception of topographic characteristics in these geometrically compromised datasets, various visualisation techniques have been developed to artificially restore and enhance the data that was initially discarded. While these techniques work very well to enhance the remaining pertinent features present in such data sets, data downscaling can nevertheless irrevocably eliminate significant amounts of important archaeological information. Therefore, this paper outlines a new processing and interpretation pipeline for complex archaeological 3D surfaces that do not rely on downscaling of data, while also discussing several 3D-related concepts and issues along the way. More specifically, this article focusses on the generation of intelligently decimated, two-manifold triangular meshes and the subsequent geo-referenced 3D interpretative mapping of these surfaces. Furthermore, all applications can be considered low- and even no-cost, making this a readily implemented processing and interpretation workflow. Additionally, all software packages are easy to learn and flexible enough for implementation in any existing mixed software pipeline.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Verhoeven","given":"Geert J."}],"citation-key":"verhoeven2017","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-016-9305-z","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"999-1033","source":"link-springer-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca","title":"Mesh Is More—Using All Geometric Dimensions for the Archaeological Analysis and Interpretative Mapping of 3D Surfaces","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-016-9305-z","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"vernet2019","abstract":"Bronze artifacts from Early Bronze Age in Europe often contain white inclusions in the metallic matrix, that are identified as tin oxides (SnO2 or Cassiterite). These inclusions are interpreted as un-smelted residues coming from the copper ore and are generally mixed with more complex oxidized inclusions, which contain sulfur, antimony, arsenic, silver, nickel and cobalt. The nature, shape and distribution of these partially smelted tin inclusions give information on the alloying process. Depending on the technological context and the geographical areas, the presence of such inclusions might indicate that the material has been produced by selecting and supplementing of raw materials containing SnO2 (e.g. co-smelting). In order to understand the role of tin oxide inclusions in the production of bronzes and possible recycling procedures, a crosscutting investigation has been carried out, based on experimental researches. The results show that tin oxides do not completely reduce after four re-melting cycles (recycling) and such a fact is deeply related to the oxygen availability and the dwell time that influences the kinetics of the reaction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Vernet","given":"J."},{"family":"Ghiara","given":"G."},{"family":"Piccardo","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"vernet2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.02.020","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"page":"655-662","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Are tin oxides inclusions in early archaeological bronzes a marker of metal recycling?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18304917","volume":"24"},

Rather than suggesting that actors are hemmed in or incapacitated by multiple infrastructural commitments, inclusions, and exclusions, I show instead how they work artfully to align them in ways concordant with membership and how this produces both consequences for their work and opportunities for analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Vertesi","given":"Janet"}],"citation-key":"vertesi2014","container-title":"Science, Technology, & Human Values","DOI":"10.1177/0162243913516012","ISSN":"0162-2439","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"264-284","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Seamful Spaces: Heterogeneous Infrastructures in Interaction","title-short":"Seamful Spaces","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0162243913516012","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"villagran2019","abstract":"X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scans were conducted on impregnated sediment blocks from the early Holocene rockshelter site of Lapa do Santo, East-Central Brazil. The analysis was designed to investigate the presence of termite mound fragments in the archaeological sediments and test the value of complementary techniques in micromorphological studies. Soil feeding termites have been common in the tropical soils of Central Brazil since the Paleogene/Neogene and exist in high concentrations in the surroundings of Lapa do Santo. The micro-CT scans revealed a distinctive spongy microstructure inside some of the clay aggregates in the sediments that are not visible in thin section, matching the spongy microstructure inside termite mound fragments. The microstructure consists of a mix of clay and organic material (feces, saliva and other body fluids) produced by termites to cement the mounds' matrix. The cements are undistinguishable from the matrix under the microscope, but clearly visible in the micro-CT scans given the low attenuation coefficient of organo-mineral matter. The termite mound fragments appear dispersed within the ashy matrix (made of intact and reworked combustion features), suggesting their possible use in earth ovens. The combination of combustion features and reworked earth ovens attests to the complex input of anthropogenic sediments in the formation of Lapa do Santo. This study demonstrates that micro-CT can potentially disclose materials not visible in thin section and can be utilized as a complementary technique to micromorphology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Villagran","given":"Ximena S."},{"family":"Strauss","given":"André"},{"family":"Alves","given":"Marcony"},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Rodrigo Elias"}],"citation-key":"villagran2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.02.035","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"page":"785-795","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Virtual micromorphology: The application of micro-CT scanning for the identification of termite mounds in archaeological sediments","title-short":"Virtual micromorphology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18305054","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"vindrola-padros2019","abstract":"The study of size and shape of ceramic fragments is a common approach used for unraveling the depositional and post-depositional history of archaeological assemblages. Similar to sediment particles, the size and shape of a potsherd are altered under conditions of abrasion, breakage, or weathering, occurring during or after deposition, which can be the product of both human and non-human agents. Thus, the analysis of dimensional and morphological changes of fragments not only points towards specific (post)depositional processes, but can also shed light on the nature of human interaction with broken pottery. By coupling a traditional sedimentological framework for shape description and a computational approach to 2D morphometrics, in this paper we present a quick, reproducible and accurate method for studying the alteration of shape and size of potsherds. Three main shape descriptors, i.e. sphericity, roundness, and convexity, were tested on a combination of experimental and Early Neolithic potsherds in Northwest Romania from contexts where the conditions of fragment alteration were known or could be safely inferred. In addition, potsherds from an Early Neolithic pit discovered at Călineşti-Oaş-Dâmbul Sfintei Mării (Satu Mare County, Romania) were analysed for determining the pit infilling process and understanding the extent of the interaction between humans and broken pots. Results from morphometric tests show the reliability of the computational technique and shape descriptors for identifying different conditions of alteration of potsherds. The analysis of the Romanian assemblages provide insight into (post)depositional processes, showing downslope movement as the main mechanism behind the infilling of the pit at Călineşti-Oaş-Dâmbul Sfintei Mării. In addition, the potsherds possessed a high level of erosion and fragmentation, highlighting a long span of human interaction with broken materials at this site during Early Neolithic times.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Vindrola-Padrós","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Moulding","given":"Dale"},{"family":"Astaloş","given":"Ciprian"},{"family":"Virag","given":"Cristian"},{"family":"Sommer","given":"Ulrike"}],"citation-key":"vindrola-padros2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2019.01.008","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"page":"19-33","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Working with broken agents: Exploring computational 2D morphometrics for studying the (post)depositional history of potsherds","title-short":"Working with broken agents","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440318305417","volume":"104"},

  {"id":"voss2012","abstract":"As archaeologists grapple with the international curation crisis, new attention is being given to the problem of ‘orphaned’ archaeological collections and collections that are underanalysed and underreported. The common rationale for curating such collections is to restore research potential, but such efforts are met with frustration because of the difficulties of re-establishing provenance and quantitative control for artefacts long separated from their original archaeological context. Moreover, most archaeologists view curation as a process that manages, rather than investigates, archaeological collections. To the contrary, this article argues that accessioning, inventory, cataloguing, rehousing and conservation are not simply precursors to research, but rather meaningful generative encounters between scholars and objects. Examples from the curation of the Market Street Chinatown archaeological collection illustrate how the process of curation can generate innovative research undertakings. Because archaeological research on this collection cannot proceed in a typical way, the research developed through the curation process departs from archaeological conventions to bring new perspectives on the social history of the Overseas Chinese diaspora.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Voss","given":"Barbara L."}],"citation-key":"voss2012","container-title":"Archaeological Dialogues","DOI":"10.1017/s1380203812000219","ISSN":"1380-2038, 1478-2294","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",12]]},"language":"english","page":"145–169","title":"Curation as research.

  {"id":"voss2019","abstract":"This study expands on Ortner's practice-based theory of “serious games” by interpreting artifacts through a continuum of intention: pragmatism and play. Decisions and actions are defined as pragmatic according to their desired outcome, while play, in contrast, is an attitude or disposition toward the action itself. Both pragmatism and play are examined in this study of dining-related material culture (ceramic tablewares) from a nineteenth-century Chinatown. The research reveals that Chinatown residents varied considerably in their approach to dining, some using the full complement of British- and American-produced earthenwares associated with Victorian-era genteel dining, whereas others primarily used porcelain vessels congruent with dining conventions in southern China. Other households blended the two types of ceramics, typically using Chinese porcelain vessels for individual table settings and British- and American-produced earthenwares for serving vessels. Chinese porcelains were typically purchased in matched sets; in contrast, British and American earthenwares were acquired piece by piece, contributing aesthetic variety to Chinatown table settings. Together, these findings indicate that most Chinatown households were establishing their own “house rules” that redefined dining through new practices. The continuum of intention represented by pragmatism and play affords an integrated methodology for bridging functional/economic and cultural/symbolic interpretive frameworks in archaeology., Esta investigación amplía la teoría basada en la práctica de los “juegos serios” de Ortner al interpretar artefactos a través de un contínuo de intención entre el pragmatismo y el juego. Las decisiones y acciones son definidas como pragmáticas de acuerdo al resultado deseado; el juego, en contraste, es una actitud o disposición hacia la acción en sí misma. Tanto el pragmatismo como el juego son examinados en este estudio sobre la cultura material asociada al consumo de comida (vajilla de cerámica) de un barrio chino del siglo diecinueve. El estudio revela que los residentes del barrio chino variaban considerablemente en sus aproximaciones al comer: mientras algunos usaban un conjunto compuesto por lozas británicas y estadounidenses asociadas con las comidas elegantes de la era victoriana, otros usaban recipientes de porcelana de acuerdo a la usanza del sur de China. Algunos hogares mezclaron los dos tipos de cerámica, generalmente utilizando vasijas de porcelana china para uso individual y vajilla de producción británica y estadounidense como recipientes para servir. La porcelana china era típicamente adquirida en conjuntos a juego; en contraste, las cerámica británica y estadounidense era adquirida en piezas individuales, aportando variedad estética a la configuración de las mesas del barrio chino. En conjunto, estos hallazgos indican que la mayoría de los hogares del barrio chino establecieron sus propias “reglas caseras”, redefiniendo el comer através de nuevas prácticas.

  {"id":"voss2021","abstract":"This article is the first of a two-part series to analyze current research on harassment in archaeology. Harassment has shaped the discipline of archaeology since at least the late 1800s. Since the 1970s, harassment has been recognized as a significant factor impacting gender equity in archaeology. Recent qualitative and quantitative research has verified that harassment occurs at epidemic rates in archaeology. Archaeologists are primarily harassed by other archaeologists, and harassment occurs not only in field research settings but also in classrooms, laboratories, museums, office workplaces, and conferences. Although women in archaeology experience a higher frequency of harassment, both men and women report harassment at disturbingly high rates. Archaeologists of color, LGBTQIA+ archaeologists, nonbinary archaeologists, and archaeologists with disabilities are also disproportionately harassed. As reflected in the author's own career experiences, harassment creates a cognitive burden for survivors and reduces access to professional opportunities, directly impacting diversity within archaeology. Fortunately, there are evidence-based interventions and policies that can reduce harassment and support survivors. These are discussed in the second article, “Disrupting Cultures of Harassment in Archaeology.”\n, \nEste artículo es el primero de una serie de dos partes que analiza las investigaciones actuales sobre el acoso en arqueología. El acoso ha dado forma a la disciplina arqueológica desde, al menos, finales del siglo XIX. Desde la década de 1970, el acoso ha sido reconocido como un factor significativo que afecta la equidad de género en arqueología. Investigaciones cualitativas y cuantitativas recientes han comprobado que el acoso ocurre en tasas epidémicas dentro de esta disciplina. Lxs arqueólogxs son acosadxs principalmente por otrxs arqueólogxs. El acoso ocurre no solo en entornos de investigación de campo, sino también en aulas, laboratorios, museos, oficinas y conferencias. Si bien una mayor frecuencia de mujeres son acosadas en arqueología, tanto hombres como mujeres denuncian acoso a tasas inquietantemente altas. Lxs arqueólogxs de color, lxs arqueólogxs LGBTQIA +, lxs arqueólogxs no binarios y lxs arqueólogxs con discapacidades también son acosados de manera desproporcionada.

After the reconstruction of the three ancient tools, during the implementation of the FRAMe Project, their use was thoroughly studied, from which useful conclusions were drawn about the material processing in antiquity, as well as the details of the construction of the Antikythera Mechanism components. Following the new findings detected from the authors’ study of the X-Ray Computed Tomographies from Antikythera Mechanism Research Project, these ancient machine tools can be considered as the progenitors of the Hellenistic period machine tools, which were used for the construction of the mechanical components of the Mechanism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Voulgaris","given":"Aristeidis"},{"family":"Mouratidis","given":"Christophoros"},{"family":"Vossinakis","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"voulgaris2019","container-title":"Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage","container-title-short":"Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage","DOI":"10.1016/j.daach.2019.e00092","ISSN":"2212-0548","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,1]]},"page":"e00092","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Ancient machine tools for the construction of the Antikythera Mechanism parts","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212054818300353","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"waagen2019","abstract":"In the last decade, archaeological fieldwork has seen the increasing use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs, also: drones) and photogrammetrical techniques as tools for mapping archaeological traces in two and three dimensions. Drones allow for great control over the collection of imagery and in combination with photogrammetry put airborne 3D data capture at the disposal of archaeologists, whether they are dealing with excavations, monuments, or complete landscapes. The success of applying any new tool must however be judged in the end by a careful assessment of its tangible improvements of the primary data collection process considering expended project resources. In this context, it is important to point out that the added value of producing, often still laborious, 3D models for the primary process of data collection in field archaeology is not yet completely self-evident. Although 3D recording may be a useful additional layer of documentation for those who can afford it, the question remains to what degree the time, equipment and personnel investment actually improves our capabilities of doing archaeology. In this paper, I propose a new, well-defined, transparent and standardized mapping approach based on the combination of a budget UAS and straightforward photogrammetrical techniques, fully embedded in the workflow of knowledge production in archaeological excavation. I will reflect on the future potential of this approach, as well as engage with the ongoing discussion about developments in the processes of documentation and interpretation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Waagen","given":"Jitte"}],"citation-key":"waagen2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2018.10.011","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,1]]},"page":"11-20","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"New technology and archaeological practice.

  {"id":"wakeling2017","abstract":"This paper is the first of two Learned Publishing articles in which we report the results of a series of interviews with senior publishers and editors exploring open access megajournals (OAMJs). Megajournals (of which PLoS One is the best known example) represent a relatively new approach to scholarly communication and can be characterized as large, broad-scope, open access journals that take an innovative approach to peer review, basing acceptance decisions solely on the technical or scientific soundness of the article. This model is often said to support the broader goals of the open science movement. Based on in-depth interviews with 31 publishers and editors representing 16 different organizations (10 of which publish a megajournal), this paper reports how the term ‘megajournal’ is understood and publishers’ rationale and motivations for launching (or not launching) an OAMJ. We find that while there is general agreement on the common characteristics of megajournals, there is not yet a consensus on their relative importance. We also find seven motivating factors that were said to drive the launch of an OAMJ and link each of these factors to potential societal and business benefits. These results suggest that the often polarized debate surrounding OAMJs is a consequence of the extent to which observers perceive publishers to be motivated by these societal or business benefits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Wakeling","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Spezi","given":"Valérie"},{"family":"Fry","given":"Jenny"},{"family":"Creaser","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Pinfield","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Willett","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"wakeling2017","container-title":"Learned Publishing","container-title-short":"Learned Publishing","DOI":"10.1002/leap.1117","ISSN":"1741-4857","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"301-311","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Open access megajournals: The publisher perspective (Part 1: Motivations)","title-short":"Open access megajournals","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/leap.1117/abstract","volume":"30"},

Proponents of social media have particularly pointed towards their potential for transforming the means of networking and communication in archaeology, and challenging traditional disciplinary expertise as archaeologists engage with more diverse and active online publics. This article provides a theoretically informed critical discussion, pointing towards the complex barriers to equal Internet access and usage, which challenge the ability of archaeologists to use social media as a tool to democratize the discipline. It concludes that, in many cases, social media appear to have reinforced archaeological authority at the expense of genuinely decentred engagement or collaboration.

  {"id":"wallach2019","abstract":"Inferences from the absence of evidence to something are common in ordinary speech, but when used in scientific argumentations are usually considered deficient or outright false. Yet, as demonstrated here with the help of various examples, archaeologists frequently use inferences and reasoning from absence, often allowing it a status on par with inferences from tangible evidence. This discrepancy has not been examined so far. The article analyses it drawing on philosophical discussions concerning the validity of inference from absence, using probabilistic models that were originally developed to show that such inferences are weak and inconclusive. The analysis reveals that inference from absence can indeed be justified in many important situations of archaeological research, such as excavations carried out to explore the past existence and time-span of sedentary human habitation. The justification is closely related to the fact that archaeology explores the human past via its material remains. The same analysis points to instances where inference from absence can have comparable validity in other historical sciences, and to research questions in which archaeological inference from absence will be problematic or totally unwarranted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Wallach","given":"Efraim"}],"citation-key":"wallach2019","container-title":"Palgrave Communications","DOI":"10.1057/s41599-019-0307-9","ISSN":"2055-1045","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,20]]},"language":"en","license":"2019 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"1-10","publisher":"Palgrave","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Inference from absence: the case of archaeology","title-short":"Inference from absence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0307-9","volume":"5"},

We found that CENS researchers are willing to share their data, but few are asked to do so, and in only a few domain areas do their funders or journals require them to deposit data. Few repositories exist to accept data in CENS research areas.. Data sharing tends to occur only through interpersonal exchanges. CENS researchers obtain data from repositories, and occasionally from registries and individuals, to provide context, calibration, or other forms of background for their studies. Neither CENS researchers nor those who request access to CENS data appear to use external data for primary research questions or for replication of studies. CENS researchers are willing to share data if they receive credit and retain first rights to publish their results.

  {"id":"watrall2014","abstract":"While digital games are used for health intervention, language training, and science learning, there are few instances of games being used to teach archaeology. This is a missed opportunity, as narratives of exploration and discovery make archaeology well suited to digital games. This article discusses Red Land/Black Land, a prototype Civilization V mod (modification of an existing game) that allows players to explore both the process of cultural change in ancient Egypt and the construction of archaeological knowledge about ancient Egypt. As a case study of scholarly game design, the article explores the project’s development. Included is a discussion of play mechanics, the merits and process of modding, and the resources required to build games in academic environments. The article also discusses preliminary efforts to test the game in an undergraduate classroom. Ultimately, the article argues that digital games are powerful tools for communicating archaeology. Instead of falling under the glamour of commercial games, however, scholars should adopt cost effective approaches to game design, looking to mobile play, alternate reality games, modding, and browser based games to realize their vision. The article also argues that the actual process of designing a game is an excellent tool to teach archaeology.\n, \nSi bien los juegos digitales se han utilizado como parte de las terapias de rehabilitación, en el prendizaje de idiomas o en la enseñanza de la ciencia, existen muy pocos casos en el que los juegos se han utilizado para la enseñanza de la arqueología.

Este artículo discute un prototipo del mod Civilización V, llamado Red Land/Black Land, que permite a los jugadores explorar tanto los procesos de cambio cultural en el antiguo Egipto, como la construcción de conocimiento arqueológico acerca del antiguo Egipto. Siendo éste un estudio de caso sobre el diseño de un juego académico, el artículo explora el desarrollo del proyecto. Incluido en éste, se integra una discusión sobre la mecánica del juego, los méritos y el proceso de modificación o “modding”, así como los recursos requeridos para elaborar juegos en medios académicos. Además, el artículo analiza los esfuerzos preliminares que se han hecho para probar el juego en un salon de clases de educación superior. Finalmente, el artículo sustenta que los juegos digitales son herramientas excelentes para la enseñanza de la arqueología. En lugar de caer bajo el encanto de los juegos comerciales, los académicos, no obstante, deberán adoptar estrategias en el diseño de juegos que sean efectivas en términos de sus costos, explorar los juegos móviles, los juegos de realidad alternativa, el “modding” y los juegos de navegador para lograr su objetivo. El artículo también sustenta que el proceso que se ha seguido en el diseño del juego es una excelente herramienta para la enseñanza de la arqueología.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Watrall","given":"Ethan"}],"citation-key":"watrall2014","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.7183/2326-3768.2.1.38","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",2]]},"language":"en","page":"39-49","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Red Land/Black Land: Teaching Ancient Egyptian Archaeology through Digital Game-Based Learning","title-short":"Red Land/Black Land","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/red-landblack-land/21C7DB70D5DAE580B0A0107F0D7B8F4C","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"watrall2019","abstract":"As the role of digital methods in heritage and archaeology has increased in prominence, so has the question of capacity and community building. Who should receive training in digital methods? How should training take place? What concepts, platforms, technologies should be taught? These are relevant questions requiring careful planning and thoughtful implementation; yet beyond these questions, there is an issue of even greater importance: the planned development of communities of practice. The teaching of digital methods has a greater chance of success if it takes place in an ecosystem of scholars who are connected to one another through shared perspectives on those methods. This article presents and discusses the details of a model developed at Michigan State University that speaks to teaching digital archaeology and heritage methods, and to the development of communities of practice in which those methods are shared and relevant. The model is driven and informed by the activities of three projects: the National Endowment for the Humanities-funded Institute on Digital Archaeology Method & Practice, the Cultural Heritage Informatics Graduate Fellowship Program, and the Department of Anthropology Digital Cultural Heritage Fieldschool., A medida que el papel de los métodos digitales en el patrimonio y la arqueología ha aumentado en importancia, también lo ha hecho la cuestión de la capacidad y la construcción de la comunidad. ¿Quién debería recibir formación en métodos digitales? ¿Cómo debe llevarse a cabo la formación? ¿Qué conceptos, plataformas, tecnologías se deben enseñar? Todas son preguntas relevantes que requieren una planificación estudiada y una implementación cuidadosa. ¿Igualmente importante es la cuestión de cómo desarrollamos y fomentamos comunidades de práctica en las que los estudiantes y académicos están conectados a través de una perspectiva compartida sobre el despliegue de métodos digitales y enfoques computacionales? Este artículo presenta y analiza un modelo desarrollado en la Michigan State University que habla sobre la enseñanza de métodos digitales en arqueología y patrimonio, así como sobre el desarrollo de comunidades de práctica en las que esos métodos son compartidos y relevantes. El modelo, que privilegia la transparencia, la generosidad, el fracaso productivo y un espíritu de construcción, está impulsado e informado por las actividades de tres proyectos: el Instituto para Digital Archaeology Method & Practice financiado por la Fundación Nacional para las Humanidades de los EE.UU., la Beca de Graduados en Cultural Heritage Informatics, y el Departamento de Antropología Digital Cultural Heritage Fieldschool.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Watrall","given":"Ethan"}],"citation-key":"watrall2019","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2019.1","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5]]},"language":"en","page":"140-151","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Building Scholars and Communities of Practice in Digital Heritage and Archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/building-scholars-and-communities-of-practice-in-digital-heritage-and-archaeology/16EF118B270F3A4920320EEC2177FFBD","volume":"7"},

However, due to the often unavoidably subjective nature of visual interpretation, fundamental issues with its application remain problematic and largely unresolved. Furthermore, in recent years the rising dominance of digital techniques for archaeological threedimensional surveys and interpretive visualisation has resulted in a rapid uptake of emerging technologies without adequate assessment of their impact on the interpretive process and practitioner engagement. Using an example from experimental work in Orkney as a springboard for discussion this paper outlines the need for the field to develop a more practical approach to addressing some of these recurring issues by developing methodologies which more accurately reflect the multi-layered, interpretive and ambiguous processes involved in archaeological interpretation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Watterson","given":"Alice"}],"citation-key":"watterson2015","container-title":"Open Archaeology","DOI":"10.1515/opar-2015-0006","ISSN":"2300-6560","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"source":"DeGruyter","title":"Beyond Digital Dwelling: Re-thinking Interpretive Visualisation in Archaeology","title-short":"Beyond Digital Dwelling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/opar.2014.1.issue-1/opar-2015-0006/opar-2015-0006.xml","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"way2018","abstract":"There is a general awareness amongst archaeologists that the intensity of a sampling program, i.e. the number of pits, their size and their spacing, has a strong bearing on discovery rates. However, rarely is the effect of this relationship on specific sampling strategies explicitly assessed due to the difficulty of running the required mathematical models. This paper presents a new simulation tool Dig It, Check It, which allows the archaeologist to easily determine the effectiveness of a sampling program against a variety of artefact site types. This is the first model to be presented which employs simulation to assess the effectiveness of irregular, real-world subsurface sampling programs through the importation of an ArcGis file. This means that a sampling strategy which includes test-pits of varying sizes and intervals can be assessed, as can survey areas of non-rectangular shape. Small artefact concentrations are particularly vulnerable to detection failure, and this model allows the archaeologist to determine whether their absence reflects reality or is a product of the sampling program.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Way","given":"Amy Mosig"},{"family":"Tabrett","given":"Amy"}],"citation-key":"way2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2018.06.034","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,1]]},"page":"71-75","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A new simulation tool for the assessment of subsurface testing: Dig It Check It","title-short":"A new simulation tool for the assessment of subsurface testing","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18300828","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"webmoor2005","abstract":"A recent trend in archaeology has been to turn reflexive attention upon the methods                 employed by archaeologists in field practice. In this article, I take a step back to                 consider the map as a fundamental conceptual framework that archaeologists utilize                 in directing their methods and formulating interpretations. I explore what a map                 ‘does' for the consideration of a site. I work around this                 question with the ‘Millon map’ of Teotihuacán, Mexico                 as a case study. Building upon ideas expressed by Alfred Gell and Roland Barthes, I                 argue that maps cannot be utilized as independent, self-contained media, as maps                 ‘work’ via an inherent mutuality of subjective and objective                 elements. In archaeological discourse, this is best expressed by the integration of                 photography and graphic representation. Finally, I offer an example of integrated                 ‘mapwork’ through a novel interpretation of space at                 Teotihuacán. It is reiterated that media such as maps operate as                 conceptual frameworks and so predispose certain interpretations. Acknowledging this                 recursive relationship between media and interpretation draws critical awareness to                 the media archaeologists employ and encourages the innovative use of mediational                 techniques to engage archaeological subjects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Webmoor","given":"Timothy"}],"citation-key":"webmoor2005","container-title":"Journal of Social Archaeology","container-title-short":"Journal of Social Archaeology","DOI":"10.1177/1469605305050143","ISSN":"1469-6053","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"52-84","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Mediational techniques and conceptual frameworks in archaeology: A model in ‘mapwork’ at Teotihuacán, Mexico","title-short":"Mediational techniques and conceptual frameworks in archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1469605305050143","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"webmoor2007","abstract":"This paper discusses the principle of symmetry for archaeology in light of the discipline's theoretical legacy. At the core, this principle involves a reconfiguration of how the relationship between humans and things is characterized. Advocating the recognition of mixtures of what are routinely parsed into categories of nature and society, a symmetrical archaeology centres itself upon the equitable study of the discipline's defining ingredients. It is argued that such symmetry of humans and things undercuts many pesky dualisms exhibited throughout the recent history of archaeological theory and practice. The article summarizes the salient formulations of this relationship in archaeological thinking and suggests that a symmetrical focus on ontological mixtures removes the reliance upon multiplying epistemological settlements that fragment the discipline.

Working through the specifics of how this new media mogul operationalized the functionality of Web 2.0 at a cultural heritage site, I identify the salient components of what is new about this emerging technology (a “platform shift”) and how it parallels ethical and legal demands to open archaeology to greater public involvement (a “paradigm shift”). Considering the emerging centrality of users in new media, I examine the potential of new media for academic projects by discussing the integration of a wiki, a particular and defining type of new media, into the investigation of what constitutes heritage for locals at Teotihuacan.

It uses the topology of knots to examine these engagements and introduce readers to several key issues. Knots are practical heuristics that are useful in subverting mereology, a dominant logic of modernist thought that figures epistemological, ontological, and sociological relations. Against mereology knots do not parse, but instead focus attention upon collective action and outcome. The chapter deploys a particular symmetrical weave that binds ropes through adding weight and friction-load. With respect to the intellectual ‘load’ of temporality, performativity/representationalism, scale and symmetry, key matters of concern for both fields, it is argued that there is slippage. Consequently, STS misses out on re-sharpening its provocative edge in not developing these issues through the rich empirics of archaeological practice. Archaeology, in this asymmetry, risks not contributing to the timely conversation around things transversing the disciplines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Webmoor","given":"Timothy"},{"family":"Graves-Brown","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Harrison","given":"Rodney"}],"citation-key":"webmoor2013","container-title":"The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of the Contemporary World","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199602001.013.039","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"105-120","source":"www.oxfordhandbooks.com","title":"STS, Symmetry, Archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199602001.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199602001-e-039"},

  {"id":"wellen2004","abstract":"This paper focuses on the ‘open access’ movement in scholarly publishing, a movement of research librarians, scholars, research funding bodies and other stakeholders of the scholarly research process. Open access advocates argue that scholarly communities need to organize against the currently unworkable system whereby academics donate articles for free, yet have to buy them back at often exorbitant prices from journal publishers. In particular, they seek to replace subscription-based funding of journals with a range of alternatives that includes self-archiving and publication fees by researchers and their sponsors. The central claims of my study are twofold. The first is that the open access movement has indeed highlighted the need for the reform of scholarly publishing markets and practices. My second claim, however, is that certain proposals and models for reform are premised on over-optimistic views about disintermediation in scholarly communication as well as exaggerated assertions about the benefits of removing price barriers when larger issues about the system of ‘open science’ remain to be addressed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Wellen","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"wellen2004","container-title":"Journal of Academic Ethics","container-title-short":"Journal of Academic Ethics","DOI":"10.1023/B:JAET.0000039010.14325.3d","ISSN":"1572-8544","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",3,1]]},"language":"english","page":"101–118","title":"Taking on Commercial Scholarly Journals: Reflections on the ‘Open Access’ Movement","title-short":"Taking on Commercial Scholarly Journals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1023/B:JAET.0000039010.14325.3d","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"wendrich2013","abstract":"Archaeologists study a wide array of material remains to propose conclusions about non-material aspects of culture. The intricacies of these findings have increased over recent decades, but only limited attention has been paid to what the archaeological record can tell us about the transfer of cultural knowledge through apprenticeship.  Apprenticeship is broadly defined as the transmission of culture through a formal or informal teacher–pupil relationship. This collection invites a wide discussion, citing case studies from all over the world and yet focuses the scholarship into a concise set of contributions. The chapters in this volume demonstrate how archaeology can benefit greatly from the understanding of the social dimensions of knowledge transfer. This book also examines apprenticeship in archaeology against a backdrop of sociological and cognitive psychology literature, to enrich the understanding of the relationship between material remains and enculturation.  Each of the authors in this collection looks specifically at how material remains can reveal several specific aspects of ancient cultures: What is the human potential for learning? How do people learn? Who is teaching? Why are they learning? What are the results of such learning? How do we recognize knowledge transfer in the archaeological record? These fundamental questions are featured in various forms in all chapters of the book. With case studies from the American Southwest, Alaska, Egypt, Ancient Greece, and Mesopotamia, this book will have broad appeal for scholars—particularly those concerned with cultural transmission and traditions of learning and education—all over the world.","author":[{"family":"Wendrich","given":"Willeke"}],"citation-key":"wendrich2013","ISBN":"978-0-8165-9930-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",1,1]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"285","publisher":"University of Arizona Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Archaeology and Apprenticeship: Body Knowledge, Identity, and Communities of Practice","title-short":"Archaeology and Apprenticeship","type":"book"},

  {"id":"wernke2014","abstract":"Medium-scale archaeological phenomena (large settlements, landscape features and infrastructural systems, road networks, etc.) pose significant challenges to archaeological documentation. Traditionally, such features are mapped either schematically or via labor-intensive (or otherwise costly) high-resolution methods. The advent of inexpensive, packable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and lighter-than-air platforms, combined with increasingly sophisticated photogrammetric and mobile geographic information system (GIS) software systems, presents opportunities for improving on these compromises. Here, we present results from test flights and photogrammetric mapping using UAVs and a meteorological balloon, combined with mobile GIS-based attribute registry of architectonic features at a large, complex colonial planned settlement (Mawchu Llacta de Tuti) in highland colonial Peru. First, the operating parameters of UAVs are presented, as well as the imagery capture and photogrammetric processing work flows. Second, we provide an overview of the tablet-based mobile GIS system used to digitize a site plan (based on the imagery from the UAV) and register architectural attributes from each building. The results from initial testing suggest that in the near future, such combined close-range photogrammetry and mobile GIS-based systems will significantly enhance and expedite high-resolution data registry of a wide range of archaeological features, sites, and landscapes.\n, \nFenómenos arqueológicos de escala media (asentamientos grandes, rasgos de paisaje y sistemas de infraestructura, redes de caminos, etc.) presentan retos significativos para la documentación arqueológica. Tradicionalmente se levantan planos de tales rasgos o esquemáticamente o por métodos de alta resolución necesitando labor intensivo (o costosos en otros sentidos). El advento de vehículos aéreos no tripulados (“drones” o UAV) económicos y portátiles, tanto como plataformas más leves del aire, combinado con sistemas de información geográfica y software fotogramétrico cada vez más sofisticado presenta oportunidades para mejorar estos compromisos. Aquí presentamos los resultados de los vuelos iniciales de prueba y ortomapeo tridimensional usando UAV y un globo meteorológico, en combinación con un Sistema de Información Geográficas (SIG) móvil para el registro de atributos de rasgos arquitectónicas en una grande y complejo asentamiento planificado colonial (Mawchu Llacta de Tuti) en la sierra suroeste del Perú. En primer lugar, se presentan los parámetros de funcionamiento de los UAV, así como la captura de imágenes y los flujos de trabajo de procesamiento fotogramétrico. En segundo lugar, ofrecemos una visión general del sistema SIG móvil utilizada para digitalizar un plano del sitio (basado en los imágenes procesados del UAV) y para registrar los atributos arquitectónicos de cada edificio y rasgos visible en la superficie del sitio. Los resultados de las pruebas iniciales sugieren que en un futuro próximo, tales sistemas combinados entre SIG móvil y fotogrametría de baja altitud mejorarán de manera significativa y acelerará el registro de datos de alta resolución de una amplia gama de sitios arqueológicos y las características del paisaje.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Wernke","given":"Steven A."},{"family":"Adams","given":"Julie A."},{"family":"Hooten","given":"Eli R."}],"citation-key":"wernke2014","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.7183/2326-3768.2.3.147","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",8]]},"language":"en","page":"147-163","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Capturing Complexity: Toward an Integrated Low-Altitude Photogrammetry and Mobile Geographic Information System Archaeological Registry System","title-short":"Capturing Complexity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/capturing-complexity/22A3C3132AA4F5C6ADAB72DEE1265582","volume":"2"},

The promise of collecting archaeologically relevant data beyond the scale of regional surveys is among the most exciting prospects of the “data revolution.” Yet previous efforts have either struggled to generate high-quality data within expansive regions or to use well-edited interregional datasets to address novel research questions. We discuss the development of two collaborative research projects that seek to address these problems—GeoPACHA (Geospatial Platform for Andean Culture, History and Archaeology) and LOGAR (Linked Open Gazetteer of the Andean Region). The former is an online platform facilitating virtual archaeological survey of satellite and historical aerial imagery; the latter collates primary source information on Andean places.

  {"id":"wey2021","abstract":"Background The MINDMAP project implemented a multinational data infrastructure to investigate the direct and interactive effects of urban environments and individual determinants of mental well-being and cognitive function in ageing populations. Using a rigorous process involving multiple teams of experts, longitudinal data from six cohort studies were harmonised to serve MINDMAP objectives. This article documents the retrospective data harmonisation process achieved based on the Maelstrom Research approach and provides a descriptive analysis of the harmonised data generated.\nMethods A list of core variables (the DataSchema) to be generated across cohorts was first defined, and the potential for cohort-specific data sets to generate the DataSchema variables was assessed. Where relevant, algorithms were developed to process cohort-specific data into DataSchema format, and information to be provided to data users was documented. Procedures and harmonisation decisions were thoroughly documented.\nResults The MINDMAP DataSchema (v2.0, April 2020) comprised a total of 2841 variables (993 on individual determinants and outcomes, 1848 on environmental exposures) distributed across up to seven data collection events. The harmonised data set included 220 621 participants from six cohorts (10 subpopulations). Harmonisation potential, participant distributions and missing values varied across data sets and variable domains.\nConclusion The MINDMAP project implemented a collaborative and transparent process to generate a rich integrated data set for research in ageing, mental well-being and the urban environment. The harmonised data set supports a range of research activities and will continue to be updated to serve ongoing and future MINDMAP research needs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Wey","given":"Tina W."},{"family":"Doiron","given":"Dany"},{"family":"Wissa","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Fabre","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Motoc","given":"Irina"},{"family":"Noordzij","given":"J.

  {"id":"whitcherkansa2014","abstract":"Archaeologists increasingly employ various digital tools in the documentation of fieldwork and post-excavation analysis. In doing so, they create vast amounts of data. Archaeologists need to create such rich bodies of digital data because archaeology is often destructive; that is, an excavated area can never be excavated in exactly the same way again. However, professional norms that only reward conventional article and book publication endanger these irreplaceable data. Typically, when archaeologists publish, the majority of the underlying data (representing significant fieldwork hours and expense) are unreported. In this paper, we argue that archaeology needs to adopt publication norms and reward systems better suited for the twenty-first century research environment. We explore efforts to make high quality publication in archaeology more accessible and data rich. Cultivating a more open and dynamic “information ecosystem” in archaeology will spark new research and teaching opportunities and help better integrate archaeology's knowledge contributions within the larger context of humanistic and scientific understanding.","author":[{"family":"Whitcher Kansa","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Kansa","given":"Eric C."}],"citation-key":"whitcherkansa2014","container-title":"Near Eastern Archaeology","DOI":"10.5615/neareastarch.77.3.0223","ISSN":"1094-2076","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"223–227","title":"Data Publishing and Archaeology's Information Ecosystem","type":"article-journal","volume":"77"},
  {"id":"whitcherkansa2015","abstract":"The inability of journals and books to accommodate data and to make it reusable has led to the gradual loss of vast amounts of information. The practice of disseminating selected sub-sets of data (usually in summary tables) permits only very limited types of reuse, and thus hampers scholarship. In recent years, largely in response to increasing government and institutional requirements for full data access, the scholarly community is giving data more attention, and solutions for data management are emerging. However, seeing data management primarily as a matter of compliance means that the research community faces continued data loss, as many datasets enter repositories without adequate description to enable their reuse. Furthermore, because many archaeologists do not yet have experience in data reuse, they lack understanding of what “good” data management means in terms of their own research practices. This paper discusses Linked Open Data (LOD) as an approach to improving data description, intelligibility and discoverability to facilitate reuse. I present examples of how annotating zooarchaeology datasets with LOD can facilitate data integration without forcing standardization. I conclude by recognizing that data sharing is not without its challenges. However, the research community’s careful attention and recognition of datasets as valuable scholarly outputs will go a long way toward ensuring that the products of our work are more widely useful.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Whitcher Kansa","given":"Sarah"}],"citation-key":"whitcherkansa2015","container-title":"Ethnobiology Letters","DOI":"10.14237/ebl.6.2.2015.467","ISSN":"2159-8126","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,18]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2015 Ethnobiology Letters","page":"224-231","source":"ojs.ethnobiology.org","title":"Using Linked Open Data to Improve Data Reuse in Zooarchaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ojs.ethnobiology.org/index.php/ebl/article/view/467","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"whitcherkansa2018","abstract":"This special section stems from discussions that took place in a forum at the Society for American Archaeology's annual conference in 2017. The forum, Beyond Data Management: A Conversation about “Digital Data Realities”, addressed challenges in fostering greater reuse of the digital archaeological data now curated in repositories. Forum discussants considered digital archaeology beyond the status quo of “data management” to better situate the sharing and reuse of data in archaeological practice. The five papers for this special section address key themes that emerged from these discussions, including: challenges in broadening data literacy by making instructional uses of data; strategies to make data more visible, better cited, and more integral to peer-review processes; and pathways to create higher-quality data better suited for reuse. These papers highlight how research data management needs to move beyond mere “check-box” compliance for granting requirements. The problems and proposed solutions articulated by these papers help communicate good practices that can jumpstart a virtuous cycle of better data creation leading to higher impact reuses of data., Esta sección especial nace de las discusiones que tuvieron lugar en uno de los foros del Congreso Anual de la Society for American Archaeology en 2017. El foro, Beyond Data Management: A Conversation about Digital Data Realities (“Más allá de la gestión de datos: Conversaciones sobre las realidades de los datos digitales”), abordó los retos que se plantean al fomentar una mayor reutilización de los datos arqueológicos digitales actualmente conservados en repositorios. Los participantes del foro sostuvieron que la arqueología digital va más allá de su interpretación tradicional como mera gestión de datos, argumentando que es necesario situar de manera mejor el intercambio y la reutilización de datos en la práctica arqueológica. Los cinco textos que conforman esta sección especial abordan temas clave que surgieron de estas discusiones: el desafío de ampliar el alfabetismo de datos mediante el uso de los mismos como herramientas de instrucción; estrategias para lograr que los datos sean más visibles, mejor citados y más integrados en el proceso de revisión por pares; y formas de crear datos de mayor calidad que se presten mejor a la reutilización. En estos trabajos se destaca además cómo la gestión de datos de investigación debe ir más allá del simple cumplimiento del requisito de “rellenar casillas” para su verificación. Los problemas y las propuestas articulados en estos comunicaciones pueden ayudar a implementar mejores prácticas de creación de datos, que a su vez resultarán en un mayor impacto en la reutilización de los mismos.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Whitcher Kansa","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Kansa","given":"Eric C."}],"citation-key":"whitcherkansa2018","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.1017/aap.2018.7","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5]]},"language":"en","page":"89-92","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Data Beyond the Archive in Digital Archaeology: An Introduction to the Special Section","title-short":"Data Beyond the Archive in Digital Archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/data-beyond-the-archive-in-digital-archaeology/104B99A80EF0FCEE6EE67A81376EC8EB","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"white2021","abstract":"Field safety is being taken more seriously across the cultural resource management (CRM) industry as CRM companies seek to be in compliance with their clients’ health and safety programs and to keep employees safe. Many universities also have organizational health and safety programs designed to protect students and employees, but academic archaeology is routinely conducted without adequate risk management planning. Risk management will be a workplace concern for aspiring archaeologists after graduating from college, which is why it is important for academic archaeology to meet industry standards. Archaeology can learn a great deal about fieldwork risk management from the outdoor recreation industry, which emphasizes building leadership skills rather than following proscribed rules and regulations to mitigate the myriad hazards in the field. This article provides some suggestions that academic archaeologists can use to apply risk management concepts from CRM and the outdoor recreation industry to academic projects in order to comply with university requirements and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), as well as to teach students how to be safe in the field.\n, \nLa seguridad en el campo está tomando mayor importancia dentro de la industria de gestión de recursos culturales (CRM), esto se debe a que las empresas de CRM buscan cumplir con los programas de salud y seguridad de sus clientes.

Sin embargo, la arqueología académica generalmente se realiza de manera rutinaria y sin una planificación adecuada de la gestión de riesgos.

  {"id":"whitley2017","abstract":"In the more than 25 years since Allen et al. (1990), GIS and other kinds of geospatial analysis have become tools used almost as ubiquitously in archaeology as the trowel and the total station. However, can we consider it a “paradigm-shifter?” One fundamental distinction between archaeology and other scientific pursuits is the lack of a formal experimental procedure for testing large-scale hypotheses. We can experiment with some material culture methods or archaeological ‘models’ on a 1:1 analogue scale, but we rarely examine ideas about larger mechanisms; particularly those that encompass wide geographic areas in a formal experimental way. Geospatial technologies give us new tools and abilities to recognize patterns in archaeological sites and landscapes. Nevertheless, have they truly changed the way we make the transition from material remains to interpreting human behavior? We tend to present geospatial research that is either descriptive or methodological in nature rather than interpretive or explanatory. What is missing is the recognition that the ‘patterns’ we can see are an incomplete and abstract product of past human agency or behavior that cannot be worked backwards from, but must be envisioned as mechanisms in action. Within a mechanistic framework, we can experiment with archaeological research questions in much greater depth and detail, in a manner more akin to psychology than the ‘harder’ sciences. Although these techniques bring with them some theoretical assumptions and methodological challenges, their outcomes can provide logical and convincing visualizations of dynamic phenomena in enlightening ways. Presented here are several brief examples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Whitley","given":"Thomas G."}],"citation-key":"whitley2017","collection-title":"Archaeological GIS Today: Persistent Challenges, Pushing Old Boundaries, and Exploring New Horizons","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2017.05.008","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,1]]},"page":"103-114","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Geospatial analysis as experimental archaeology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440317300717","volume":"84"},
  {"id":"whittaker1998","abstract":"Typological systems are essential for communication between anthropologists as well as for interpretive purposes. For both communication and interpretation, it is important to know that different individuals using the same typology classify artifacts in similar ways, but the consistency with which typologies are used is rarely evaluated or explicitly tested. There are theoretical, practical, and cultural reasons for this failure. Disagreements among archaeologists using the same typology may originate in the typology itself (i.e., imprecise type definitions, confusing structure) or in the classification process, because of observer errors, differences in perception and interpretation, and biases. We review previous attempts to evaluate consistency in typology and classification, and use consensus analysis to examine one well-established typology. Both consensus and disparity are apparent among the typologists in our case study, and this allows us to explore the kinds of forces that shape agreement and diversity in the use of all typological systems. We argue that issues of typological consistency are theoretically and methodologically important. Typological consistency can be explicitly tested, and must be if we hope to use typologies confidently.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Whittaker","given":"John C."},{"family":"Caulkins","given":"Douglas"},{"family":"Kamp","given":"Kathryn A."}],"citation-key":"whittaker1998","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/BF02427967","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"129-164","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Evaluating consistency in typology and classification","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02427967","volume":"5"},

The Teozacoalco Archaeological Project was inspired by colonial-period documents housed in the Nettie Lee Benson Latin American Library at the University of Texas at Austin. Chiyo Cahnu, a Mixtec kingdom better known as Teozacoalco, was the scene of Aztec and Spanish colonial incursions. The archiving in Texas of the famous Mapa de Teozacoalco and associated documents pertaining to the kingdom/municipality, as well as other documents related to Teozacoalco, neighboring Mixtec kingdoms, and other indigenous Oaxacan communities housed in libraries, archives, and museums distant from those communities, invites us to consider some important issues: how and why they left their original homes and arrived in their present locations and legal and ethical ramifications of housing them outside of their homeland.

Whether measured in terms of spatial extension or just sheer mass, infrastructural entities are often among the biggest artifacts that archaeologists encounter in the field. Yet there is no overarching theoretical framework for the archaeological study of infrastructure, and its different varieties tend to be treated in a rather piecemeal fashion. This article therefore seeks to lay some foundations for a more theoretically unified approach to infrastructure within the discipline. It offers a general definition or infrastructure, as well as a basic typology. The typology presented is fourfold, encompassing (1) static infrastructure (e.g., terraces, harbors and storehouses), (2) circulatory infrastructure (e.g., highways, canals, aqueducts, and sewers), (3) bounding infrastructure (e.g., palisades, ditches, and corrals), and (4) signaling infrastructure (e.g., lighthouses and beacons). By analogy with more heavily theorized categories such as urbanism, it is suggested that infrastructure should be a topic of global comparative analysis within archaeology and its allied disciplines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilkinson","given":"Darryl"}],"citation-key":"wilkinson2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-018-9410-2","ISSN":"1573-7764","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1216-1241","source":"Springer Link","title":"Towards an Archaeological Theory of Infrastructure","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-018-9410-2","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"williams2019","abstract":"While exploration of Australian post-colonial (≤0.25 ka) OSL dating is well established in a range of natural sedimentary contexts (e.g. fluvial, aeolian, coastal), to date there have been no successful examples of the technique applied to archaeological sediments of this era. Here we present the results of multi-phase compliance-based archaeological excavations of a new bridge crossing, the Hawkesbury-Nepean River (northwest Sydney). These works identified a Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) aeolian deposit through which a colonial era drainage system had been excavated. Historical documents reveal the construction of the system occurred between 1814 and 1816 CE. An opportunistic range-finding Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) sample was obtained from anthropogenic trench backfill – composed of reworked LGM deposits – immediately above the drainage system. Minimum and Finite Mixture age models of single grain quartz OSL provided a date of 1826 CE (1806–1846 CE), in close agreement with the documented age of construction. These findings provide the first evidence of a colonial structure reliably dated using OSL, and demonstrate the feasibility of wider deployment of OSL dating to other archaeological sites of the recent era (≤0.25 ka). We propose that such environments associated with large volumes of sand-rich backfill, in particular, likely heighten OSL dating success. We propose that well-documented historical archaeological sites in Australia also have the potential to provide a robust testing ground for further evaluating the accuracy of OSL dating in a range of young archaeological sedimentary contexts, potentially to sub-decadal levels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Alan N."},{"family":"Toms","given":"Phil S."},{"family":"Marcus","given":"David"},{"family":"Yousif","given":"Anita"},{"family":"McGuinness","given":"James"},{"family":"O'Sullivan","given":"Ashley"},{"family":"Barry","given":"Laressa"},{"family":"Bryant","given":"Tessa"},{"family":"Wood","given":"Jamie C."}],"citation-key":"williams2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.03.020","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"page":"993-1002","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The first successful application of Optically Stimulated Luminescence dating to a colonial era (<0.25 ka) archaeological site in Australia","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18307636","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"wilshusen2016","abstract":"High-quality archaeological surveys and data are vital to preservation planning and mitigation efforts. Federal and state historic preservation offices (SHPOs) are accumulating and reviewing more data at an ever-faster pace. Given the critical nature of this information, a SAA task force was charged with assessing current survey practices and concerns. Our review indicates that survey policies and archaeological standards have improved substantially over the last two decades, but SHPOs remain challenged by insufficient professional training for field archaeologists, the need for standardization and integration of new technologies in field work, reporting, and review, as well as the sheer quantity and variety of digital data. A number of analytical tools and metrics are available to assess data quality, but seemingly there is not time or money for states to evaluate how to improve existing and future survey data. We draw upon a survey of SHPOs, a review of current literature, and our own experience to assess archaeological survey quality, data utility and durability for current and anticipated future uses. We offer suggestions on how to move forward, including consideration of an e-106 system for streamlining transfer and exchange of digital data and upgrading current approaches to survey and planning.\n, \nProspección y datos arqueológicos de alta calidad son vitales para los esfuerzos de planificación y mitigación.

Nuestra revisión indica que las políticas de prospecciones y los estándares arqueológicos han mejorado sustancialmente en las últimas dos décadas, pero SHPOs todavía enfrentan los desafíos de insuficiente entrenamiento profesional para los arqueólogos de campo, la falta de normalización y la integración de nuevas tecnologías en el trabajo de campo, presentación de informes y revisión de formas, así como por la gran cantidad de datos digitales. Una serie de herramientas y métricas de análisis están disponibles para evaluar la calidad de los datos, pero al parecer no hay tiempo ni dinero para que los estados evalúen cómo mejorar los datos de las encuestas actuales y futuras. Nos basamos en una encuesta de SHPOs, una revisión de la literatura actual, y nuestra propia experiencia para evaluar la calidad, la utilidad y la durabilidad de los datos arqueológicos para las necesidades actuales y futuras anticipadas. Ofrecemos sugerencias de cómo seguir adelante, incluyendo la consideración de un sistema de e -106 para agilizar la transferencia y el intercambio de datos digitales y la mejora de los enfoques actuales para prospección y planificación.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilshusen","given":"Richard H."},{"family":"Heilen","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Catts","given":"Wade"},{"family":"Dufour","given":"Karyn","dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Bradford"}],"citation-key":"wilshusen2016","container-title":"Advances in Archaeological Practice","DOI":"10.7183/2326-3768.4.2.106","ISSN":"2326-3768","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",5]]},"language":"en","page":"106-117","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Archaeological Survey Data Quality, Durability, and Use in the United States: Findings and Recommendations","title-short":"Archaeological Survey Data Quality, Durability, and Use in the United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/archaeological-survey-data-quality-durability-and-use-in-the-united-states/C16D3FCBE1C9C6BD55216D75D1C91AB0","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"wilson2017","abstract":"Author summary Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"Greg"},{"family":"Bryan","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Cranston","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Kitzes","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Nederbragt","given":"Lex"},{"family":"Teal","given":"Tracy K."}],"citation-key":"wilson2017","container-title":"PLOS Computational Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Computational Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510","ISSN":"1553-7358","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,22]]},"language":"en","page":"e1005510","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Good enough practices in scientific computing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"wiltshire2017","abstract":"Moving image archives—like many other archives—are considered a passive repository of knowledge extraction, rather than an active site of knowledge production. Following the premise that archives are indeed a source of knowledge production, this article explores how moving image archives have the potential to produce new and alternative knowledges by bringing to light factors that may have influenced archaeological practice, factors captured within a moving image archive but obscured or marginalized within linear accounts of this practice. While such an archive may exist unevenly, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) has been historically positioned to develop a moving image archive that features a number of well-known archaeological investigations. Yet this archive and similar moving image archives remain overlooked and underutilized resources. In order to address this, emphasis is placed on producing detailed, searchable, and retrievable content description for moving image archives. In doing so, this article maintains that the knowledge and experience brought to the management of this archive following the author's transition “from archaeologist to archivist,” is key to promoting the discoverability and accessibility of this archive with potential clients in the archaeological, academic, and broader community.\n, \nLos archivos de imágenes en movimiento—como muchos otros archivos—se consideran repositorios pasivos de extracción de conocimiento más que sitios activos de producción de conocimiento.

While critical of archaeological dealings with issues of bodily experience and place, the article suggests an alternative is to be found in the work of media artist Janet Cardiff. Building on Cardiff's art, media are treated as modes of engagement for dealing with the articulation of bodily experience and place. This article works towards a notion of mediation through which qualities of the material world, normally left behind by traditional forms of documentation, are brought forth.

  {"id":"witmore2004a","abstract":"Deeply embedded in much of archaeological thought is an epistemological scheme of the ‘field’ as separate from the ‘home-base’, whether laboratory, archive or study. This modernist division is inadequate, for it fails to account for the interconnected and nonlinear process of archaeological knowledge construction. Taking direction from science studies and specifically from the work of Bruno Latour, this article sketches a model of multiple fields, which may serve as an alternative to this divide. Through the effective juxtaposition of two case studies from the Greek Peloponnesus, it explores two disparate yet complementary cases of how multiple fields make up the epistemological terrain of archaeology. The first case study traces the strains of an early 19th-century web, which situates the process of knowledge production at that time, while the second focuses on the archaeological process by closely following the transformation of things into documents during a regional survey. By recasting and multiplying the ‘field’ in archaeology we move from an oversimplified and bounded modernist scheme to one that allows for the complexities of archaeological practices which involve the action of instruments, media and human beings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Witmore","given":"Christopher L."}],"citation-key":"witmore2004a","container-title":"Archaeological Dialogues","DOI":"10.1017/s1380203805001479","ISSN":"1478-2294, 1380-2038","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",12]]},"language":"en","page":"133-164","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"On multiple fields.

  {"id":"witmore2021","abstract":"Well before the turn of the century, it had become clear that archaeology's aspiration to study the past was, true to the modern project, a pretext for a deeper desire to fabricate its objects. Material culture, materiality, the material past, material residues, heritage—the objects of interpretive (post-processual) archaeology could only be characterized as a continuation of this modern project. While finding symmetry was tied to an upheaval from this mode of disciplinary production, it may now be characterized as one cue among others in more agile archaeological theory. After briefly contrasting archaeological thought before and after the turn of the century, this article sketches out some of the core features of an object-oriented approach to things, including symmetry, irreduction, emergent causality, and strangeness, among others. It then outlines how, by finding our way alongside things, we might aspire to ever more creative work with archaeological objects and their pasts.

  {"id":"wollwage2020","abstract":"For historic property types such as archaeological sites and historic buildings, data recovery is often the main part of mitigation plans offered by federal agencies with undertakings that will destroy part or all of a cultural resource. In theory, by extracting important information before destruction, we recover some part of a historic resource's cultural value. In some situations, however, data recovery is impossible or otherwise undesirable, and “creative” or off-site mitigation measures are necessary to mitigate adverse effects. In such circumstances, the Washington State Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation has accepted funding from federal agencies to create, implement, and enhance an online digital information system for cultural resources. This article describes the Washington Information System for Architectural and Archaeological Records Data (WISAARD) and provides an example of a federal agency funding WISAARD development as creative mitigation for the transfer of archaeological sites out of federal ownership. We discuss the benefits of such systems and address how their development meets preservation goals established by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation., Para tipos de propiedades históricas como sitios arqueológicos y edificios históricos, la recuperación de datos es a menudo la parte principal de los planes de mitigación ofrecidos por las agencias federales con empresas que destruirán parte o la totalidad de un recurso cultural.

  {"id":"wright2023","abstract":"The Archaeology Data Service (ADS) has been experimenting with Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies for over 12 years. As an accredited digital repository, the focus has been to explore how NLP techniques can be used to augment any basic digital object’s metadata and to begin to facilitate increased human and machine access. Thus, the words used within the ADS archive catalogue and archaeological reports have added value; they provide detail, context and understanding, but conversely, they can also be ambiguous. The NLP techniques studied go beyond allowing a user to search a PDF file, to building a classification for the user, and then continuing to improve the rules behind the method(s). While these experiments solidified our view that NLP has an important role to play in our core services, our ability to implement them in a robust way has remained elusive. This chapter presents our journey from an archaeological perspective, being useful to both researchers who wish to engage with NLP methodologies in Social Sciences and Humanities, while also giving the point of view of a trusted digital repository. Also, it reports ADS efforts to implement NLP within our collections, discussing why it remains elusive and future challenges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Wright","given":"Holly"},{"family":"Evans","given":"Tim N.

In fact they are in some respects constitutive of\npolitical interests. My thesis is that although archaeological evidence is thoroughly\nladen with theory – although it is unavoidably a construct, open to question and revision – it can nonetheless impose decisive limitations on what can be claimed about\npast cultural systems, their internal dynamics, and their trajectories of development\nand transformation.

  {"id":"wylie2017","abstract":"Archaeological data are shadowy in a number of senses. They are notoriously incomplete and fragmentary, and the sedimented layers of interpretive scaffolding on which archaeologists rely to constitute these data as evidence carry the risk that they will recognize only those data that conform to expectation. These epistemic anxieties further suggest that, once recovered, there is little prospect for putting “legacy” data to work in new ways. And yet the “data imprints” of past lives are a rich evidential resource; archaeologists successfully mine old data sets for new insights that redirect inquiry, often calling into question assumptions embedded in the scaffolding that made their recovery possible in the first place. I characterize three strategies by which archaeologists address the challenges posed by legacy data: secondary retrieval and recontextualization of primary data, and the use old data in experimental simulations of the cultural past under study. By these means, archaeologists establish evidential claims of varying degrees of credibility, not by securing empirical bedrock but through a process of continuously building and rebuilding provisional empirical foundations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Wylie","given":"Alison"}],"citation-key":"wylie2017","container-title":"Science, Technology, & Human Values","container-title-short":"Science, Technology, & Human Values","DOI":"10.1177/0162243916671200","ISSN":"0162-2439","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",3,1]]},"language":"english","page":"203–225","title":"How Archaeological Evidence Bites Back: Strategies for Putting Old Data to Work in New Ways","title-short":"How Archaeological Evidence Bites Back","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0162243916671200","volume":"42"},

  {"id":"xie2018","abstract":"Earth-working spades were crafted from bone, stone, and wood in preindustrial societies. In the early Hemudu culture (7000-6000 BP) in eastern China, bone, particularly wild water buffalo scapulae, was preferred for crafting spades to modify the margins of wetlands for cultivation and occupation. Experimental and ethnographic research show that earth properties in the area adequately explains why wooden spades were less common; however, preference for bone spades over stone spades requires explanations beyond techno-functions during use. This paper identifies potential factors during the manufacturing procedure that might have encouraged the development and persistence of the scapular spade tradition. Replication experiments reconstructed the manufacturing procedure of the Hemudu scapular spade in comparison to that of a groundstone equivalent. The results showed that the manufacture knowledge was sophisticated for bone as well as for stone. However, the adequate level of know-how for successful production was lower for bone. Surprisingly, the costs in time and manufacturing tools for crafting a good enough bone tool were higher than those for a stone counterpart. In fact, the manufacture of bone tools involved the use of advanced groundstone tools. Overall, the Hemudu tool producers appear to have made their technological choices based on traditional conformity as well as resistance to motor skill adjustment rather than comprehensive cost-benefit assessment. The persistence of the scapular spade tradition led to increased investments into sophisticated modifications to cope with increasingly arduous earth-working tasks and likely led to increased investment into raw material procurement when bone raw materials became scarce. The results also suggest that technological ease and manufacturing costs in tool production should be evaluated carefully within the behavioral contexts, while taking into account that implements crafted from a variety of raw materials were employed in manufacturing the tool and that the costs and benefits in production are not equally perceivable to decision makers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Xie","given":"Liye"}],"citation-key":"xie2018","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2018.06.009","ISSN":"0305-4403","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,1]]},"page":"77-89","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Scapulae for shovels: Does raw material choice reflect technological ease and low cost in production?","title-short":"Scapulae for shovels","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440318303431","volume":"97"},

  {"id":"yakel2019","abstract":"Introduction. We present an in-depth case study that follows collaborative data sharing, curation and reuse practices among eleven zooarchaeologists and two curators during a large data reuse project. A data life-cycle model highlights how factors in one life-cycle phase impacted other phases forming virtuous (positive) and vicious (negative) circles.\nMethod. Mixed methods were employed, including individual and focus group interviews, observations, documentary analysis of e-mail threads, and review of curatorial guidelines.\nAnalysis. Interview and e-mail data had two rounds of qualitative coding. General topical codes were established first. Next, relationships among the four life-cycle phases (data production, sharing, curation, and reuse) and factors having positive or negative effects were coded.\nResults. Data production practices were the most influential on other phases, data sharing practices followed. Curatorial intervention, at times laborious, did reverse factors that negatively influenced curation and reuse. Data reuse had a positive influence on all other phases.\nConclusion. Data producers partnering with data curators to steer the data production process, after data management planning and before data deposit, is critical to avoid the proliferation of vicious circles and enable meaningful data reuse. Understanding the impact of data practices, can lead to self-reflection on the part of data producers, sharers, curators, and reusers.","author":[{"family":"Yakel","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Faniel","given":"Ixchel M."},{"family":"Maiorana","given":"Zachary J."}],"citation-key":"yakel2019","container-title":"Information Research","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"publisher":"University of Borås","source":"Google Scholar","title":"Virtuous and vicious circles in the data life-cycle","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://informationr.net/ir/24-2/paper821.html","volume":"24"},

The exploration of trade relations through the meticulous study of ceramic material remains a key axis of the research; methodologically, mapping continues to enhance our understanding of patterns of distribution and possible trade relations. Recently, the ongoing accumulation of ceramic evidence from various parts of the Byzantine Empire has led researchers to test tools beyond traditional ‘flat’, non-interactive modes of illustration. In addition, network analysis is emerging as a dynamic force in archaeology. Having reviewed the existing evidence on mapping Byzantine ceramic material, the paper presents the results of a sub-project undertaken within the framework of “Kyrtou Plegmata—Convex Grids. Networks of economy, power and knowledge in the Hellenic space from prehistory into the modern age: analytic documentation—interpretive mapping—synthetic approaches”, a project of the Institute of Historical Research, within the General Secretariat for Research and Technology's KRIPIS action. The new tool for mapping ceramic data uses digital infrastructures and provides the user with interactivity.

  {"id":"yoder2014","abstract":"For over 40 years, some archaeologists have labored under a distorted interpretation of the 50-year rule in which anything more than 50 years of age becomes “archaeological” and therefore must be recorded and evaluated for eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places. A reexamination of federal law shows that this is a mistaken interpretation. Data from the Intermountain Antiquities Computer System indicates that, if this practice continues, the number of featureless historical sites requiring documentation in the West will greatly increase at a large expense to the public and that most of these costs will be associated with sites not considered significant in American history, architecture, archaeology, engineering, or culture. Solutions are presented that will give archaeologists greater flexibility in recording material culture more than 50 years of age, allowing us to redirect our efforts to resources of greater interest while making the practice of archaeology more defensible to the public. These problems are symptomatic of a larger issue that relates to how cultural remains from the latter part of the twentieth century and beyond will be valued. The discipline of archaeology must begin candid conversations about the relative importance of such recent material culture and its management implications.\n, \nDurante más de 40 años, algunos arqueólogos han trabajado bajo una interpretación distorsionada de la regla de los cincuenta años, en la que cualquier cosa que tenga una antigüedad de más de cincuenta años se considera “arqueológica” y por lo tanto debe ser registrada y evaluada para determinar su elegibilidad ante el National Register of Historic Places. Una revisión de la ley federal demuestra como ésta es una interpretación errónea. Los datos de la Intermountain Antiquity Computer System indican que de seguir esta práctica, el número de sitios históricos sin ninguna característica especial que requiere de documentación en el occidente de los Estados Unidos aumentará de manera considerable a expensas del público y que la mayor parte de estos costos estarán asociados a sitios que no son considerados significativos para la historia la arquitectura, la arqueología, la ingeniería o la cultura americana. Las soluciones que se presentan darán a los arqueólogos una mayor flexibilidad en el registro de la cultura material de más de cincuenta años de antigüedad, lo que nos permite redirigir nuestros esfuerzos a los recursos de mayor interés, al mis o tiempo que se justifica la práctica arqueológica ante el público. Estos problemas son sintomáticos de una cuestión mayor que se relaciona con la forma en la que se valorarán los restos culturales de la segunda parte del siglo 20 y los posteriores a éste.

  {"id":"yoffee2016","abstract":"“Infrastructural power” refers to how states “penetrate” their societies and also how local organizations resist such attempts. This essay explores the latter sense of infrastructural power. First, it notes aspects of local power in ancient Mesopotamia, tracing the existence of councils and assemblies over about 3000 years and establishing the concept of a “heterarchy of power” in Mesopotamia, which is a counternarrative to assertions of totalitarian power by kings and central governments. There follows a cross-cultural review of selected other ancient cities and states in order to assess comparable and contrasting local organizations and degrees of infrastructural power. Finally, resistance to state power is explored, and a speculation about the qualities of stability and fragility of political power in early cities and states is advanced.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Yoffee","given":"Norman"}],"citation-key":"yoffee2016","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","container-title-short":"J Archaeol Method Theory","DOI":"10.1007/s10816-015-9260-0","ISSN":"1072-5369, 1573-7764","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1053-1065","source":"link-springer-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca","title":"The Power of Infrastructures: a Counternarrative and a Speculation","title-short":"The Power of Infrastructures","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-015-9260-0","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"zangrossi2019","abstract":"Archaeological investigations at the Paleolithic Piovesello open-air site in Italy have brought to light a small lithic workshop composed of 123 artefacts (Structure I). In order to remedy to the destructive nature of the excavation, we developed a conservative protocol based on a three-dimensional reconstruction of the heap, enabling us to restore information lost during the removals of the flakes. A 3D model of the structure and its close context was produced for each artefact through laser scanning, and then it was spatially positioned after the creation of a relative coordinate system using Structure from Motion with Agisoft Photoscan and by rectifying 24 photographs documenting different SI removal stages, performed by the software QGIS. Images provide X, Y coordinates of the findings located at the base of SI; for the Z coordinate is used the quote recorded during excavation. To reconstruct the formation process of the structure, we investigated its stratigraphy and performed the analysis according to different technological and morphometrical parameters, as core reduction stages, dimensional classes, presence of direct connections like refittings. Once Structure I has been interpreted like a primary workshop formed during knapping activities, it was possible to cross different data and to recognize six depositional stages, in which the alternation of large-size core shaping products, management flakes and fine full- production artefacts is visible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zangrossi","given":"Filippo"},{"family":"Delpiano","given":"Davide"},{"family":"Cocilova","given":"Arianna"},{"family":"Ferrari","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Balzani","given":"Marcello"},{"family":"Peresani","given":"Marco"}],"citation-key":"zangrossi2019","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","container-title-short":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.102045","ISSN":"2352-409X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"102045","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"3D visual technology applied for the reconstruction of a Paleolithic workshop","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X19304778","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"zorzin2021","abstract":"Since the 1980s, archaeology has been further embedded in a reinforced and accelerating capitalist ideology, namely neo-liberalism. Most archaeologists had no alternative but to adapt to it through concessions to the free-market economy and to the so-called mitigations taking place within development. However, it is now apparent that the ongoing global socio-ecological disaster we are facing cannot be reversed with compromises but rather with a radical engagement against the injunctions of competition and growth. I suggest that we must anticipate the necessary transformations of archaeology in the coming decades, before archaeology becomes a technical avatar of the neo-liberal dogma, or before its complete annihilation for being deemed ‘superfluous’ (Wurst 2019, 171) by the capitalist regime. In this paper, I will use the idea of ‘degrowth’ to propose a new paradigm for archaeology by applying the concepts of civil disobedience, voluntary simplicity, redistribution of means and the ethics of no-growth.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Zorzin","given":"Nicolas"}],"citation-key":"zorzin2021","container-title":"Archaeological Dialogues","DOI":"10.1017/S1380203821000015","ISSN":"1380-2038, 1478-2294","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6]]},"language":"en","page":"1-16","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Is archaeology conceivable within the degrowth movement?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/archaeological-dialogues/article/is-archaeology-conceivable-within-the-degrowth-movement/B3A29F1EFD318612B9F1250BD1A65265","volume":"28"},
  {"id":"zorzin2023","abstract":"Since the 1970s, scholars like Donella Meadows, Dennis Meadows, and Jorgen Randers (Meadows et al. 2022 [2004]: 383–454), have been actively proposing actions to guarantee the sustainability for life outside of the ideological framework imposed within the ‘Capitalocene’ (Moore 2016). In this specific context, activist archaeology certainly has a role to play in answering the questions: “is archaeology useful?” (Dawdy 2009: 131), or “why archaeology?” (Tilley 1989: 105; McGuire 2008: xi). The genesis of these questions likely emerges from the aim of millennial and Gen Z archaeologists to use their archaeological skills meaningfully, or at least in a way that does not harm people or the environment and preferably is somehow beneficial to communities. Thus, an activist archaeology is about reorienting the focus of archaeological research and emphasizing action itself as the heart of future research programs (Stottman 2010: 9) or even as a rescue program that seeks social, economic, political, and ecological justice. This active approach challenges and transgresses the traditional bounds of academic archaeology, rather than conceptualizing activism as a potential by-product of archaeological practice (McGuire 2008: xii).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Zorzin","given":"Nicolas"}],"citation-key":"zorzin2023","contributor":[{"literal":"Universitätsbibliothek Der FU Berlin"},{"literal":"Universitätsbibliothek Der FU Berlin"}],"DOI":"10.17169/REFUBIUM-40270","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial No Derivatives 4.0 International","page":"5 S.","publisher":"Freie Universität Berlin","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"What Concrete Forms Might an Activist Scholarly Archaeology Take? – Two Examples of Experimental Projects","title-short":"What Concrete Forms Might an Activist Scholarly Archaeology Take?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://refubium.fu-berlin.de/handle/fub188/40550"},

  {"id":"zotero-9176","abstract":"This book is an introduction to the many human, social, and political aspects of software engineering. It's unique in two ways. First, unlike many software engineering books, it explictly avoids centering technical questions about software engineering, instead focusing on the many ways that software engineering work is cognitive, social, and organizational. Second, it does so by engaging extensively with academic research literature, summarizing key findings, but also questioning them, opening a dialog about the nature of software engineering work and the many factors that shape it. Anyone that reads it will be better prepared to critically engage in creating software in teams.\n\nThis book is a living document. Do you see ways to improve it?

  {"id":"zotkina2019","abstract":"Techno-traceological studies in rock art are dedicated to reveal the properties of gestures and tools used for making petroglyphs. The purpose of this kind of research is to identify technological tendencies in figurative traditions, for that we have to analyze a great number of figures. Determination of the tools demands large efforts for manual classification, but today the procedure is much simpler thanks to 3D visualization. We aim at supporting techno-traceological studies of petroglyphs by 3D shape classification algorithms. We use 3D segmentation approach to determine the shapes of tool marks and classification algorithms to reveal the difference (for lithic/metal tool traces). We applied the approach to experimental and archaeological test on 3D models of petroglyphs. As a perspective in developing a complete analytical tool we think of creating a more accurate classification.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Zotkina","given":"Lydia V."},{"family":"Kovalev","given":"Vasiliy S."}],"citation-key":"zotkina2019","container-title":"Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage","container-title-short":"Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage","DOI":"10.1016/j.daach.2019.e00099","ISSN":"2212-0548","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,1]]},"page":"e00099","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Lithic or metal tools: Techno-traceological and 3D analysis of rock art","title-short":"Lithic or metal tools","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212054818300468","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"zubrow2005","abstract":"Archaeology has always been concerned both with telling the story of the past and telling \nstories about the past. Archaeologists and archaeology are a strange mixture of scientist \nand science and storyteller and narrative reconstruction. As practitioners we try to draw a \ncoherent picture that encompasses both human meanings and general processes. This is a \ndifficult enough task in today’s world where one may interview agents, hear stories first \nhand, and directly measure the impacts of actions.

  {"id":"zuiderwijk2024","abstract":"To understand how open research data sharing and reuse can be further improved in the field of Epidemiology, this study explores the facilitating role that infrastructural and institutional arrangements play in this research discipline. It addresses two research questions: 1) What influence do infrastructural and institutional arrangements have on open research data sharing and reuse practices in the field of Epidemiology? And 2) how could infrastructural and institutional instruments used in Epidemiology potentially be useful to other research disciplines? First, based on a systematic literature review, a conceptual framework of infrastructural and institutional instruments for open research data facilitation is developed. Second, the conceptual framework is applied in interviews with Epidemiology researchers. The interviews show that two infrastructural and institutional instruments have a very high influence on open research data sharing and reuse practices in the field of Epidemiology, namely (a) access to a powerful search engine that meets open data search needs and (b) support by data stewards and data managers. Third, infrastructural and institutional instruments with a medium, high, or very high influence were discussed in a research workshop involving data stewards and research data officers from different research fields. This workshop suggests that none of the influential instruments identified in the interviews are specific to Epidemiology. Some of our findings thus seem to apply to multiple other disciplines. This study contributes to Science by identifying field-specific facilitators and challenges for open research data in Epidemiology, while at the same time revealing that none of the identified influential infrastructural and institutional instruments were specific to this field. Practically, this implies that open data infrastructure developers, policymakers, and research funding organizations may apply certain infrastructural and institutional arrangements to multiple research disciplines to facilitate and enhance open research data sharing and reuse.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Zuiderwijk","given":"Anneke"},{"family":"Türk","given":"Berkay Onur"},{"family":"Brazier","given":"Frances"}],"citation-key":"zuiderwijk2024","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0297969","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,8]]},"language":"en","page":"e0297969","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Identifying the most important facilitators of open research data sharing and reuse in Epidemiology: A mixed-methods study","title-short":"Identifying the most important facilitators of open research data sharing and reuse in Epidemiology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297969","volume":"19"}
