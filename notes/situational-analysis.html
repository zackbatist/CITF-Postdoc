<p>Some notes on situational analysis and related methods are useful for my work. Largely drawn from <span class="citation" data-cites="clarke2016">Adele E. Clarke, Friese, and Washburn (<a href="#ref-clarke2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="maps">Maps</h2>
<p>The main strategies involved in SA are the three maps that researchers do across the full trajectory of the project, from the earliest design stages to the preparation of publications.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="clark2005">Clark (<a href="#ref-clark2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>: 30)</span> explains why mapping is a useful method:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Why situational maps? Why not narratives? There are a number of reasons. Let me start with some advantageous properties of maps elucidated by David Turnbull (2000) and elaborated by me. Because maps are visual representations, they helpfully rupture (some/most of) our normal ways of working and may provoke us to see things afresh (e.g., Latour 1986, 1988b; Suchman 1987). Maps also work more easily as discursive devices for mak ing assemblages and connections — relational analyses. Maps are excellent “devices to materialize questions.” Maps are tools of control, appropriation, and ideological expression. Mapping is a fundamental cognitive process we can “just do it.” Mapping opens up knowledge spaces. Maps are great boundary objects — devices for handling multiplicity, heterogeneity, and messiness in ways that can travel. Maps work well as spatial and temporal narratives. Maps allow unmapping and remapping. In addition, maps are very much part of the Chicago tradition as devices for analyzing relationality (see Chapter 2). Most important here, one can move around on/in maps much more quickly and easily than in narrative text, excellent for analytic work. Last, at least since the postcolonial era began, maps have been widely understood as very political — and shifting — devices. Hopefully, this will provoke enhanced reflexivity. The limitations of maps remain, of course, what can be “seen” by a particular analyst in a particular time and place. No method overcomes the situatedness of its users. A method can, however, attempt to use situatedness to improve the quality of the research.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The first maps are the situational maps that lay out the major human, nonhuman, discursive, historical, symbolic, cultural, political, and other elements in the research situation of concern and provoke analy sis of relations among them. These maps are intended to capture and discuss the messy complexities of the situation in their dense relations and permuta tions. They intentionally work <em>against</em> the usual simplifications so characteristic of scientific work (Star 1983, 1986) in particularly postmodern ways.</p>

<p>From <span class="citation" data-cites="fosket2021">Fosket (<a href="#ref-fosket2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>: [: 272-273]:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Mapping the Situation: Who/What Matters to STAR Upon entering the field of STAR, one of the first things I realized was that this “site” itself consisted of multiple sites. It comprised many different elements complexly organized and webbed together to form what I ultimately conceived of as the “STAR trial arena.” Nonhuman actants (things of various kinds from furniture to technologies to discourses), social actors, body parts, research protocols, organi zations, and paperwork represent key elements in the constitution of the trial, and critical activists and passionate advocates are central. Additionally, the deeper I delved into the research, the more obvious and important the historical and political situatedness of STAR became. By requiring the researcher to map out all of the “analytically pertinent human and nonhuman, material and symbolic/dis cursive elements of a particular situation as framed by those in it <em>and by the analyst</em>” <span class="citation" data-cites="clarke2005">(<a href="#ref-clarke2005" role="doc-biblioref">Adele E. Clarke 2005</a>: 87)</span>, situational maps draw out complexities and reveal which anticipated and unanticipated elements of the situation matter.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Because they are intended to be done and redone multiple times across the life of a research project, there is no one “right” map. If you put something on it that turns out not to be important, you can delete it later or just ignore it. But if it was there in the first place, or got there during the research, at least you integrated it into the research design and sought some data about it systematically and have some sense of its relative importance.</p>

<p>Framed as an extension of (messy) situational maps. From <span class="citation" data-cites="clarke2016">Adele E. Clarke, Friese, and Washburn (<a href="#ref-clarke2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>: 107)</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Once you have your messy map, you can do relational analyses. This is the next phase of analytic work to be done with the messy map. … Then you take each element in turn and think about it in relation to each other element on the map. Literally center on one element and draw lines between it and the others and specify the nature of the relation ship by describing the nature of that line. One does this systematically, one at a time, from every element on the map to every other. Use as many maps as seem useful to diagram yourself through this analytic exercise. This to me is the major work one does with the situational map once it is constructed. This is one of those sites where being highly systematic in considering data can flip over into the exciting and creative moments of intellectual work. And sometimes there is no payoff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With regards to sorting out and prioritizing the work at early stages, from <span class="citation" data-cites="clarke2016">Adele E. Clarke, Friese, and Washburn (<a href="#ref-clarke2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>: 108)</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Relational maps also help the analyst to decide which stories—which relations—to pursue. This is especially helpful in the early stages of research when we tend to feel a bit mystified about where to go and what to memo. A session should produce several relational analyses with the situational maps and several memos. One would return to elaborate on these memos several times as data are collected. They should also be useful guides for theoretical sampling.</p>

<p>He worked assiduously on framing and articulating ways to do grounded theory research that included specifying the structural conditions—seeking to literally make them vis ible in doing grounded theory analysis. Strauss’s provisional solution, largely pur sued with Juliet Corbin, was the <em>conditional matrix</em>, a strategy for supplementing grounded theory’s usual processual emphasis with serious attention to more struc tural contextual “<em>conditions</em>.” Strauss’s pragmatist interactionist sociology was based most of all in understanding <em>action as a situated activity</em>. Thus, for Strauss, the conditional matrix was a <em>situating device — a heuristic means of enabling grounded theory researchers to envision the contexts and conditions under which the action is occurring</em>.</p>

<p>Here the concentric circles represent the more structural conditions <em>within</em> which the focus of analysis dwells.

<p>There are two problems here. First, the concentric circles seem to predetermine relations between particular concerns and the phenomenon under study.

That is, <em>the relations among the important elements need to be empirically specified, studied, and interpreted</em>.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Some years ago, Katovich and Reese (1993:400-405) interestingly argued that Strauss’s negotiated order and related work recuperatively pulled the social around the postmodern turn through its methodological (grounded theoretical) recognition of the partial, tenuous, shifting, and unstable nature of the, empirical world and its constructedness. I strongly agree and would argue that Strauss also particularly furthered this “postmodernization of the social” through his conceptualizations of social worlds and arenas as modes of understanding the deeply situated yet always also fluid organizational ele ments of negotiations and discourses. He foreshadowed what later came to be known as postmodern assumptions: the instability of situations; the char acteristic changing, porous boundaries of both social worlds and arenas; social worlds seen as mutually constitutive/coproduced in the negotiations taking place in arenas; negotiations as central social processes hailing that “things can always be otherwise”; and so on. Negotiations also signal micropolitics of power and the powers of discourses-decentering the subject and power in its more fluid and discursive forms (e.g., Foucault 1979, 1980) — as well as “the usual” meso/macro structural elements.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Social worlds theory assumes multiple collective actors—social worlds—in all kinds of negotiations in a broad and often contentious substantive arena. Arenas are focused on matters about which all the involved social worlds and actors care enough to be (1) committed to act, and (2) to produce discourses about arena concerns. Thus, arenas are sites of action and discourse. They are discursive sites in often complicated ways. Particular social worlds are constructed in other world’s discourses as well as producing their own. But arenas usually endure for some time, and longstanding arenas are typically characterized by multiple, complex, and layered discourses that interpolate and combine old(er) and new(er) elements in on-going, contingent, and inflected practices. Further, because perspectives and commitments differ, arenas are usually sites of contestation and controversy. As such, they are especially good for analyzing heterogeneous perspectives or positions and for analyzing power in action (a lesson from technoscience studies) (e.g., Nelkin, 1995). Arenas are also especially amenable conceptual frames through which to work at a more meso/ organizational level, analyzing collective actors (social worlds), their work, and discourses in those arenas.</p>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="clarke2005">Adele E. Clarke (<a href="#ref-clarke2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>: 46)</span> on what constitutes social worlds:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Social worlds are universes of discourse (Mead 1938/1972:518) and principal affiliative mechanisms through which people organize social life. Insofar as it meaningfully exists, society as a whole, then, can be conceptualized as consisting of layered mosaics of social worlds and arenas. Strauss argued (1978:122) that each social world has at least one primary activity, particular sites, a technology (inherited or innovative means of carrying out the social world’s activities), and, once under way, more formal organizations typically evolve to further one aspect or another of the world’s activities. Hughes (1971) offered the more informal notion of a going con cern in which certain assumptions about what activities are important and what will be done can be taken for granted. People typically participate in a number of social worlds/going concerns simultaneously, and such par ticipation usually remains highly fluid. Entrepreneurs, deeply committed and active individuals (Becker 1963), cluster around the core of the world and mobilize those around them (Hughes 1971:54). Shibutani (1986:109) viewed social worlds as identity- and meaning-making segments in mass society, drawing on distinctive aspects of mass culture, with individuals capable of participation in only a limited number of such worlds. There can also be implicated actors in a social world and/or arena, actors silenced or only discursively present — constructed by others for their own purposes (Clarke &amp; Montini 1993). This concept provides a means of analyzing the situatedness of less powerful actors and the consequences of others’ actions for them and raises issues of discursive constructions of actors and of nonhuman actants. I will therefore discuss it at some length. There are at least two kinds of implicated actors. First are those implicated actors who are physically present but are generally silenced/ignored/ invisibled by those in power in the social world or arena. Second are those implicated actors not physically present in a given social world but solely dis cursively constructed; they are conceived, represented, and perhaps targeted by the work of those others; hence they are discursively present. Neither category of implicated actors is actively involved in the actual negotiations of self-representation in the social world or arena, nor are their thoughts or opinions or identities explored or sought out by other actors through any openly empirical mode of inquiry (such as asking them questions). They are neither invited by those in greater power to participate nor to represent If themselves on their own terms. physically present, their perceptions are largely ignored and/or silenced. The difference between the two types turns on the issue of their physical presence.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>There can, of course, also be implicated actants-implicated nonhuman actors in situations of concern. Like humans, implicated actants can be physically and/or discursively present in the situation of inquiry. That is, human actors (individually and/or collectively as social worlds) routinely discursively construct nonhuman actants from those human actors’ own perspectives.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The concept of implicated actors and actants can be particularly useful in the explicit analysis of power in social worlds and arenas. Such analyses are both complicated and enhanced by the fact that there are generally multiple discursive constructions circulating of both the human and nonhuman actors in any given situation. Analyzing power involves analyzing: Whose con structions of whom/what exist? Which are taken as “the real” constructions or the ones that “matter” in the situation by the various participants? Which are contested? Whose are ignored? By whom? Through understanding the discursive constructions of implicated actors and actants, analysts can grasp a lot about the social worlds and the arena in which they are active and some of the consequences of those actions for the less powerful.</p>

<p>Strauss was similarly concerned with the invariably social/organizational ways in which what he frames as identities (rather than subjectivities) are produced and transformed throughout life through relations in social worlds in which people participate. … Also traceable back to Mead, both Blumer and Strauss understood individuals as constituted through such collectivities, and collectivities as constituted through interaction with other collectivities. … For Foucault, both individuals and collectivities are <em>constituted</em> through discourses and disciplining. For Strauss, both individuals and collectivities are <em>produced</em> through their participation in social worlds and arenas, including their discourses. While Foucault’s language of disciplining and the constitution of subjectivity(ies) is more insistent and decenters “the knowing subject” much more thoroughly, these productions are accomplished through routine practices.

<p>Foucault (1972) began with the concept of “the order of discourse,” asserting that ways of framing and representing linguistic conventions of meanings and habits of usage together constitute specific discursive fields or terrains. Conceptually, discourses are analytic modes of ordering the chaos of the world. His con cept of “discursive practices” described ways of being in the world that could, when historicized, be understood to produce distinctive “discursive forma tions” –— dominant discourses that bind together social injunctions about particular practices (Dreyfus &amp; Rabinow, 1983, p.&nbsp;59). Dominant discourses are reinforced through extant institutional systems of law, media, medicine, education, and so on —– often operating in conjunction. A discourse is effected in disciplining practices, which produce subjects/subjectivities through surveillance, examination, and various technologies of the self — ways of produc ing ourselves as properly disciplined subjects (e.g., Foucault, 1973, 1975, 1978, 1988).</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Nonhuman actants” are not only present as nodes in the actor network in this approach, but also have agency. In science and technology studies, such conceptions exploded dualistic notions of a technical core and social superstructure—the separability of humans and machines. Instead, the social and technical together become a “seamless web,” co-constructed and mutually embedded (Bijker, Pinch, &amp; Hughes, 1987; Latour, 1987). Woolgar (1991) captured this vividly in research on “how computers configure their users,” featuring the agency of the nonhuman in making us do things differ ently. With laptops or cell phones in place, we become “cyborgs” —– cybernetic organisms (Haraway, [1985] 1991a). … “Seeing” the agency of the nonhuman elements present in the situation disrupts the taken-for-granted, creating Meadian (e.g., [1927] 1964) moments of conceptual rupture through which we can see the world afresh. For example, “Magazines exist to sell readers to advertisers” ruptures the taken for- granted and offers a different perspective. The agency of magazines per se in the distribution of advertising discourses, normally invisible or at least not the lead point, is here rendered explicit and primary.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="boundary-objects">Boundary objects</h3>
<p>From <span class="citation" data-cites="clarke2005">Adele E. Clarke (<a href="#ref-clarke2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>: 50-51)</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Star and Griesemer (1989) developed the concept of boundary objects for things that exist at junctures where varied social worlds meet in an arena of mutual concern. Boundary objects can be treaties among countries, software programs for users in different settings, even concepts themselves. Here the basic social process is “translating the object” to address the multiple specific needs or demands placed upon it by the different worlds involved. Boundary objects are often very important to many/most of the worlds involved and hence can be sites of intense controversy and competition for the power to define them. For example, in Star and Griesemer’s (1989) study of a regional zoology museum founded at the turn of the 20th century, the museum’s spec imens were boundary objects. There were collections of multiple specimens of each species and subspecies, which, for the zoologists to find them useful, had to be very, very carefully tagged as to date and where collected, and very, verr carefully preserved and taxidermied. Aerial temperature, humidity, rainfall, and the precise habitat information on specimens were all important. The mammal and bird specimens were usually killed, gathered, and sent to the museum by amateur collectors and “mercenaries” (paid collectors) of varied backgrounds. Also involved were university administrators, a patron (herself an amateur collector), curators, research scientists, clerical staff, members of scientific clubs, and taxidermists. All had particular concerns about the spec imens that needed to be addressed and mutually articulated for the museum’s collections to “work” well for all those involved. Thus the study of boundary objects can be an important pathway into often complicated situations, allowing the analyst to study the different participants through their distinc tiye relations with and discourses about the specific boundary object in question. This can help frame the broader situation of inquiry as well. Boundary objects can be human or nonhuman.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Based on Bucher’s (1962, 1988; Bucher &amp; Stelling 1977; Bucher &amp; ,Strauss 1961) insights, interactionists have examined fluidity and change within social worlds and arenas by extending social movements analysis to include studies of reform movements of various kinds undertaken by segments or subworlds within professions, disciplines, and other work organi zations (Strauss et al.&nbsp;1964, 1985/1997). Such reform movements can cut across whole arenas, such as rationalizing and standardizing hospital quality assurance in the late 20th century United States (Wiener 2000a, 2000b). Fujimura (1988, 1996), who studied the molecularization of biology, called such larger-scale processes “bandwagons.” In many arenas, reform move ments have centered around processes of homogenization, standardization, formal classifications-things that would organize and articulate the work of the social worlds in that arena in parallel ways (e.g., Bowker &amp; Star 1999; Clarke &amp; Casper 1996; Timmermans &amp; Berg 2003).</p>

<p>The data for a situational analysis research project can be produced through in depth interviews and/or ethnographic observations, as is usual in grounded theory. However, situational analysis also strongly urges focusing on or also including extant discourse materials found in the situation under study as data—narrative, visual, and/or historical materials. These may include all kinds of documents, websites, imagery, material cultural objects, technological apparatuses, scientific or other specialized literatures, social media, and so forth. <strong>In SA, whatever discursive materials exist in the situation of inquiry are viewed as constitutive of that situation—integral parts of it—and therefore worthy of analysis.</strong></p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Situational analysis supplements traditional or basic grounded theory with alternative approaches to <em>both</em> data gathering and analysis/interpretation. In addition to producing and analyzing interview and ethnographic data, situational analysis promotes the analysis of extant narrative, visual, and his torical discourse materials. It enhances our capacities to do incisive studies of differences of perspective, of highly complex situations of action and position ality, of the heterogeneous discourses in which we are all constantly awash, and of the situated knowledges of life itself thereby produced. What I am ulti mately grappling toward are approaches that can simultaneously address voice and discourse, texts and the consequential materialities and symbolisms of the nonhuman, the dynamics of historical change, and, last but far from least, power in both its more solid and fluid forms. The outcomes of situational mappings should be “thick analyses” (Fosket 2002:40), paralleling Geertz’s (1973) “thick descriptions.” Thick analyses take explicitly into account the full array of elements in the situation and explicate their interrelations.</p>

<p>With her conceptualization of situational analyses, Clarke moved these theories further (2003, 2005). Here social worlds/arenas theory expands to include as consequential elements everything within a given situation.
