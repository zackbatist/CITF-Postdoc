<p>This document is an overview of methodological topics and concerns. It is a place where I think through and justify my methodological decisions, and identify the methods and procedures through which I implement them.</p>
<!--
## Some nomenclature
Before proceeding, it's necessary to clarify a few key terms and concepts:

**Methodology:**


**Method:**
The series of tools, techniques and procedures that structure coordinated action.

**Task:**
Goals that are constrained by specific conditions, which need to be achieved in concert or in tandem to achieve an overarching objective.
In order to realize these goals, actors conduct **actions**, which are dictated by these practical conditions.

**Procedure:**
The formal, official or pre-defined series of actions that inform how actors should complete a task.
Documented through **protocols**.


Here's a little glossary summarizing some key terms and concepts:

- methodology
  - the principles of methods, rules, and postulates employed by a discipline
  - uncovering assumptions and practices associated with the different methods and a detailed description of research designs and hypothesis testing
  - Methodology can be understood as the middle ground between concrete particular methods and the abstract and general issues discussed by the philosophy of science
  - In this regard, methodology comes after formulating a research question and helps the researchers decide what methods to use in the process. For example, methodology should assist the researcher in deciding why one method of sampling is preferable to another in a particular case or which form of data analysis is likely to bring the best results. Methodology achieves this by explaining, evaluating and justifying methods.
  - According to Aleksandr Georgievich Spirkin, "[a] methodology is a system of principles and general ways of organising and structuring theoretical and practical activity, and also the theory of this system".[16][17] Helen Kara defines methodology as "a contextual framework for research, a coherent and logical scheme based on views, beliefs, and values, that guides the choices researchers make".[18] Ginny E. Garcia and Dudley L. Poston understand methodology either as a complex body of rules and postulates guiding research or as the analysis of such rules and procedures. As a body of rules and postulates, a methodology defines the subject of analysis as well as the conceptual tools used by the analysis and the limits of the analysis.
  - John Law: Against Method
- method
  - A method is a way of reaching some predefined goal.
  - It is a planned and structured procedure for solving a theoretical or practical problem.
  - They give structure to action.
- procedure
  - May be interchangeable with "technique"
- protocol

<p>These notes describe the features, affordances and limitations of case study research, and articules factors correspoding with variable kinds of case studies.</p>
<p>I do notice a distinction between two schools of thought, which seem to be spearheaded by Stake and Yin. I generally favour Stake’s flexible approach, and it seems well aligned with other methodological works I’ve been reading <span class="citation" data-cites="abbott2004 ragin1992a">(e.g. <a href="#ref-abbott2004" role="doc-biblioref">Abbott 2004</a>; <a href="#ref-ragin1992a" role="doc-biblioref">Charles C. Ragin and Becker 1992</a>)</span>.</p>
<section id="stakes-approach" class="level4 page-columns page-full">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stakes-approach">Stake’s Approach</h4>
<p>In case-study research, cases represent discrete instances of a phenomenon that inform the researcher about it. The cases are not the subjects of inquiry, and instead represent unique sets of circumstances that frame or contextualize the phenomenon of interest <span class="citation" data-cites="stake2006">(<a href="#ref-stake2006" role="doc-biblioref">Stake 2006</a>: 4-7)</span>.</p>
<p>Cases usually share common reference to the overall research themes, but exhibit variations that enable a researcher to capture different outlooks or perspectives on matters of common concern. Drawing from multiple cases thus enables comprehensive coverage of a broad topic that no single case may cover on its own <span class="citation" data-cites="stake2006">(<a href="#ref-stake2006" role="doc-biblioref">Stake 2006</a>: 23)</span>. In other words, cases are contexts that ascribe particular local flavours to the activities I trace, and which I must consider to account fully for the range of motivations, circumstances and affordances that back decisions to perform activities and to implement them in specific ways.</p>
<p>Moreover, the power of case study research derives from identifying consistencies that relate cases to each other, while simultaneously highlighting how their unique and distinguishing facets contribute to their representativeness of the underlying phenomon. Case study research therefore plays on the tensions that challenge relationships among cases and the phenomenon that they are being called upon to represent <span class="citation" data-cites="ragin1999">(<a href="#ref-ragin1999" role="doc-biblioref">C.

<p>It should be noted that case study research limits my ability to define causal relationships or to derive findings that may be generalized across the whole field of epidemiology. This being said, case study research allows me to articulate the series of inter-woven factors that impact how epidedemiological researchers coordinate and participate in data-sharing initiatives, while explicitly accounting for and drawing from the unique and situational contexts that frame each case.</p>

<section id="yins-approach" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="yins-approach">Yin’s Approach</h4>
<p>According to Yin <span class="citation" data-cites="yin2014">(<a href="#ref-yin2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>: 16)</span>, “a case study is an empirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon (the”case”) in depth and within its real-world context, especially when the boundaries between phenomenon and context may not be clearly evident.”</p>
<p>He goes on to document some features of a case study: “A case study inquiry copes with the technically distinctive situation in which there will be many more variables of interest than data points, and as one result relies on multiple sources of evidence, with data needing to converge in a triangulating fashion, and as another result benefits from the prior development of theoretical propositions to guide data collection and analysis.” <span class="citation" data-cites="yin2014">(<a href="#ref-yin2014" role="doc-biblioref">Yin 2014</a>: 17)</span></p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="yin2014">Yin (<a href="#ref-yin2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> is more oriented toward what he refers to as a <em>realist</em> perspective, which he pits against <em>relativist</em> and <em>interpretivist</em> perspectives (used interchangably, it seems), and which I might refer to as <em>constructivist</em>. He characterizes relativist perspectives as “acknowledging multiple realities having multiple meanings, with findings that are observer dependent”. His prioriting of a realist approach corresponds with the analysis by <span class="citation" data-cites="yazan2015">Yazan (<a href="#ref-yazan2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>, who compared Yin with Stake and Merriam. According to Yazan <span class="citation" data-cites="yazan2015">(<a href="#ref-yazan2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>: 137)</span>, Yin evades making statements about his epistemic commitments, and is characterized as post-positivist.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="yin2014">Yin (<a href="#ref-yin2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> is very concerned with <em>research design</em> in case study research He posits that, in a colloquial sense, “a research design is a logical plan for getting from here to there, where here may be defined as the initial set of questions to be answered, and there is some set of conclusions (answers) about these questions.” <span class="citation" data-cites="yin2014">(<a href="#ref-yin2014" role="doc-biblioref">Yin 2014</a>: 28)</span></p>
<p>Yin distinguishes between a research design and a work plan. A research design deals with a logical problem, whereas a work plan deals with a logistical problem. Seems reminiscient of Brian Cantwell Smith’s distinction between skeletons and outlines.</p>
<p>Yin lists five components of a research design:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A case study’s questions;</li>
<li>its propositions, if any;</li>
<li>its unit(s) of analysis;</li>
<li>the logic linking the data to the propositions; and</li>
<li>the criteria for interpreting the findings.</li>
</ol>
<p>Interestingly, I have been instinctively following these steps, and am currently hovering somewhere between components 3 and 4, while dipping back to 2 once in a while too.</p>
<p>The problem of defining the unit of analysis is salient to me right now. According to Yin <span class="citation" data-cites="yin2014">(<a href="#ref-yin2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>: 32)</span>, the unit of analysis may change as the project progresses, depending on initial misconceptions (he uses the example of a unit of analysis changing from neighbourhoods to small groups, as contextualized by the socio-geographical entity of the neighbourhood, which is laden with issues of class, race, etc). In my own situation, the unit of analysis may hover between the harmonization initiative, the people, activities or infrastructures that make it work.</p>
<p>In the section on criteria for interpreting the findings, Yin emphasizes the role of rival theories, which is akin to a concern with falsifiability as a means of validating truth claims, and which betrays his positivist leanings. This may be compared with Stake’s emphasis on triangulation, which is more concerned with internal cohesiveness. Similarly, Yin cites Corbin and Strauss regarding the role of theory or theoretical propositions in research design, which similarly reveals a concern with rigorous upfront planning and strict adherence to research design as a key aspect of deriving valid findings.</p>
<p>Regarding generalizability, Yin <span class="citation" data-cites="yin2014">(<a href="#ref-yin2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>: 40-41)</span> states that “Rather than thinking about your case as a sample, you should think of it as the opportunity to shed empirical light about some theoretical concepts or principles, not unlike the motive of a laboratory investigator in conceiving of and then conducting a new experiment.” He goes on to state that case studies tend to strive for analytic generalizations that go beyond the specific case that has been studied, and which apply to other concrete situations rather than just abstract theory building.</p>

<p>Yin <span class="citation" data-cites="yin2014">(<a href="#ref-yin2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>: 72-73)</span> identifies five desired attributes for collecting case studt data:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Ask good questions — and interpret answers fairly.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>“As you collect case study evidence, you must quickly review the evidence and continually ask yourself why events or perceptions appear as they do.” (73)</li>
<li>A good indicator of having asked good questions is mental and emotional exhaustion at the end of each fieldwork day, due to the depletion of “analytic energy” associated with being attention on your toes. (73-74)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Be a good “listener” not trapped by existing ideologies or preconceptions.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Sensing through multiple modalities, not just spoken words.</li>
<li>Also subtext, as elicited through choices of terms used, mood and affective components. (74)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Stay adaptive, so that newly encountered situations can be seen as opportunities, not threats.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Remember the original purpose but willing to adapt to unanticipated circumnstances. (74)</li>
<li>Emphasize balancing adaptability with rigour, but not with rigidity. (75)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Have a firm grasp of what is being studied, even when in an exploratory mode.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Need to do more than merely record data, but interpret information as they are being collected and to know immedately whether there are contradictions or complementary statements to follow-up on. (75-76)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Avoid biases of being sensitive to contrary evidence, also knowing how to conduct research ethically.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Maintain strong professional competence, including keeping up with related research, ensuring accuracy, striving for credibility, and knowledging and mitigating against bias.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yin advocates for adoption of case study protocols. He provides an example of a table of contents for case study protocols, which generally comprise four sections:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Overview of the case study</li>
<li>Data collection procedures</li>
<li>Data collection questions</li>

<p>Stake <span class="citation" data-cites="stake2006">(<a href="#ref-stake2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>: Chapter 3)</span> lays out a procedure for deriving synthetic findings from data collected across cases. He frames this in terms of a dialectic between cases and quintains. He identifies three tracks <span class="citation" data-cites="stake2006">(<a href="#ref-stake2006" role="doc-biblioref">Stake 2006</a>: 46)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track 1: Maintains the case findings and the situationality.</li>
<li>Track 2: Merges similar findings, maintaining a little of the situationality.</li>
<li>Track 3: The most quanitative track, shifts the focus from findings to factors.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Stake, case reports should be created independently and then brought together by a single individual when working in a collaborative project. In keeping with the case-quintain dialectic, this integration must involve strategically putting the cases aside and bringing them back in to identify convergences and divergences, similarities and differences, normalitities and discrepancies among them.</p>
<p>There is some detailed discussion about different kinds of statements, i.e.&nbsp;themes, findings, factors and assertions, but I find this a bit too much detail for me to get at at this point in mymethodological planning. In general though, Stake documents a process whereby an analyst navigates back and forth between the general and the situational, presenting tentativr statements that are shored up, modified or discarded through testing compatability of the evidence across cases.</p>

I also value Charmaz’s position as someone who subscribes to her constructivist approach.</p>
<p>According to Charmaz<span class="citation" data-cites="charmaz2000">(<a href="#ref-charmaz2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>: 509)</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">

<p>Charmaz<span class="citation" data-cites="charmaz2000">(<a href="#ref-charmaz2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>: 511)</span> goes on to situate grounded theory in relation to what was the norm prior to its invention:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Glaser and Strauss’s (1967) work was revolutionary because it challenged (a) arbitrary divisions between theory and research, (b) views of qualitative research as primarily a precursor to more “rigorous” quantitative methods, (c) claims that the quest for rigor made qualitative research illegitimate, (d) beliefs that qualitative methods are impressionistic and unsystematic, (e) separation of data collection and analysis, and (f) assumptions that qualitative research could produce only descriptive case studies rather than theory development <span class="citation" data-cites="charmaz1995">(<a href="#ref-charmaz1995" role="doc-biblioref">Charmaz 1995</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prior to <span class="citation" data-cites="glaser1967">Glaser and Strauss (<a href="#ref-glaser1967" role="doc-biblioref">1967</a>)</span>, qualitative analysis was taught rather informally — they led the way in providing written guidelines for systematic qualitative data analysis with explicit procedures for data analysis <span class="citation" data-cites="charmaz2000">(<a href="#ref-charmaz2000" role="doc-biblioref">Charmaz 2000</a>: 512)</span></p>
<p>Glaser brought his very positivist assumptions from his work at Columbia, and Strauss’ work in Chicago with Herbert Blumer and Robert Park infused a pragmatic philosophical approach to the study of process, action and meaning that reflects symbolic interactionism.</p>
<section id="glaser" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="glaser">Glaser</h4>
<p>Glaser’s position comes close to traditional positivism, with assumptions of an objective, external reality and a neutral observer who discovers data. and a reductionist form of inquiry of manageable research problems. According to Charmaz <span class="citation" data-cites="charmaz2000">(<a href="#ref-charmaz2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>: 511)</span>, regarding Glaser’s approach:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Theoretical categories must be developed from analysis of the collected data and must fit them; these categories must explain the data they subsume. This grounded theorists cannot shop their disciplinary stores for preconceived concepts and dress their data in them. Any existing concept must earn its way into the analysis. … The relevance of a grounded theory derives from its offering analytic explanations of actual problems and basic processes in the research setting. A grounded theory is durable because researchers can modify their emerging or established analyses as conditions change or further data are collected.</p>

<p>Strauss and Corbin assume an objective reality, aim toward unbiased data collection, propose a series of technical procedures, and espouses verification. However, they are postpositivism because they propose giving voice to their respondents,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> representing them as accurately as possible, discovering and reckoning with how their respodents’ views on reality differ from their own, and reflecting on the research process as one way of knowing.</p>

I’m not sure if this is meant to represent Strauss and Corbin’s attitude, and whether this is an accurate representation on their views, but in my mind this should be framed as elevating, amplifying or re-articulating respondents’ voices (and this is a tenet of constructivist grounded theory in general, which derives from Charmaz). My take diverges from the position that we “give voice” to respondents in that it acknowledges (1) that the voices are already there, (2) that respondents are in fact <em>giving us</em> their voices, and (3) that the researcher plays an active editorial role, transforming the respondents’ elicitations into a format that is more amenable to analysis.</p></div></div><p>Corbin and Strauss (1990) “gained readers but lost the sense of emergence and open-ended character of Strauss’s earlier volume and much of his empirical work.

<p>Charmaz identifies these two approaches as having a lot in common: hey both advocate for mitigating factors that would hinder objectivity and minimize intrusion of the researcher’s subjectivity, and they are both embedded in positivist attitudes, with a researcher sitting outside the observed reality; Glaser exemplifies these through discovering and coding data, and using systematic comparative methods, whereas Strauss and Corbin maintain a similar distance through their analytical questions, hypotheses and methodological applications.

<p>Much of the rest of the <span class="citation" data-cites="charmaz2000">Charmaz (<a href="#ref-charmaz2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span> paper is an overview of coding and memoing methods, as well as theoretical sampling. The emphasis is on situating these techniques in the Glaser / Strauss and Corbin debate, and it will be better to refer to <span class="citation" data-cites="charmaz2014">Charmaz (<a href="#ref-charmaz2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> for in-depth notes on these techniques.</p>
<p>Charmaz <span class="citation" data-cites="charmaz2000">(<a href="#ref-charmaz2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>: 521-522)</span> provides an apt account of a significant critique of grounded theory, and poses her constructivist approach as a potential means of resolving it. Specifically, she refers to the notion that grounded theory (as traditionally conceived by both Glaser and Strauss and Corbin) “fractures” the data, making them easier to digest in an analytical sense, but also making it more difficult to engage with in a holistic manner. This is precisely the point of the original approach, to present qualitative data as data — as conceived and valued by quantitative researchers, i.e.&nbsp;as discrete, corpuscular, disembodied, re-arrangable and distant entities. The text of these two large paragraphs is copied here:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="conrad1990">Conrad (<a href="#ref-conrad1990" role="doc-biblioref">1990</a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="riessman1990">Riessman (<a href="#ref-riessman1990" role="doc-biblioref">1990</a>)</span> suggest that “fracturing the data” in grounded theory research might limit understanding because grounded theorists aim for analysis rather than the portrayal of subjects’ experience in its fullness. From a grounded theory perspective, fracturing the data means creating codes and categories as the researcher defines themes within the data. <span class="citation" data-cites="glaser1967">Glaser and Strauss (<a href="#ref-glaser1967" role="doc-biblioref">1967</a>)</span> propose this strategy for several reasons: (a) to help the researcher avoid remaining immersed in anecdotes and stories, and subsequently unconsciously adopting subjects’ perspectives; (b) to prevent the researcher’s becoming immobilized and overwhelmed by voluminous data; and (c) to create a way for the researcher to organize and interpret data. However, criticisms of fracturing the data imply that grounded theory methods lead to separating the experience from the experiencing subject, the meaning from the story, and the viewer from the viewed. In short, the criticisms assume that the grounded theory method (a) limits entry into subjects’ worlds, and thus reduces understanding of their experience; (b) curtails representation of both the social world and subjective experience; (c) relies upon the viewer’s authority as expert observer; and (d) posits a set of objectivist procedures on which the analysis rests.</p>
<p>Researchers can use grounded theory methods to further their knowledge of subjective experience and to expand its representation while neither remaining external from it nor accepting objectivist assumptions and procedures. A constructivist grounded theory assumes that people create and maintain meaningful worlds through dialectical processes of conferring meaning on their realities and acting within them <span class="citation" data-cites="bury1986 mishler1981">(<a href="#ref-bury1986" role="doc-biblioref">Bury 1986</a>; <a href="#ref-mishler1981" role="doc-biblioref">Mishler 1981</a>)</span>. Thus social reality does not exist independent of human action. Certainly, my approach contrasts with a number of grounded theory studies, methodological statements, and research texts <span class="citation" data-cites="chenitz1986 glaser1992 martin1986 strauss1990 turner1981">(see, e.g., <a href="#ref-chenitz1986" role="doc-biblioref">Chenitz and Swanson 1986</a>; <a href="#ref-glaser1992" role="doc-biblioref">Glaser 1992</a>; <a href="#ref-martin1986" role="doc-biblioref">Martin and Turner 1986</a>; <a href="#ref-strauss1990" role="doc-biblioref">Strauss and Corbin 1990</a>; <a href="#ref-turner1981" role="doc-biblioref">Turner 1981</a>)</span>. By adopting a constructivist grounded theory approach, the researcher can move grounded theory methods further into the realm of interpretive social science consistent with a Blumerian <span class="citation" data-cites="blumer1969">(<a href="#ref-blumer1969" role="doc-biblioref">1969</a>)</span> emphasis on meaning, without assuming the existence of a unidimensional external reality. A constructivist grounded theory recognizes the interactive nature of both data collection and analysis, resolves recent criticisms of the method, and reconciles positivist assumptions and postmodernist critiques. Moreover, a constructivist grounded theory fosters the development of qualitative traditions through the study of experience from the standpoint of those who live it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charmaz’s <span class="citation" data-cites="charmaz2000">(<a href="#ref-charmaz2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>: 523)</span> proposal for a re-visioned grounded theory poses research as a materializing process:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A re-visioned grounded theory must take epistemological questions into account. Grounded theory can provide a path for researchers who want to continue to develop qualitative traditions without adopting the positivistic trappings of objectivism and universality. Hence the further development of a constructivist grounded theory can bridge past positivism and a revised future form of interpretive inquiry. A revised grounded theory preserves realism through gritty, empirical inquiry and sheds positivistic proclivities by becoming increasingly interpretive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charmaz <span class="citation" data-cites="charmaz2000">(<a href="#ref-charmaz2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>: 523)</span> addresses realism and truth in constructivist grounded theory, and explicitly relates it to Blumerian situated interactionism:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A constructivist grounded theory distinguishes between the real and the true. The constructivist approach does not seek truth — single, universal, and lasting. Still, it remains realist because it addresses human <em>realities</em> and assumes the existence of real worlds. However, neither human realities nor real worlds are unidimensional. We act within and upon our realities and worlds and thus develop dialectical relations among what we do, think, and feel. The constructivist approach assumes that what we take as real, as objective knowledge and truth, is based upon our perspective <span class="citation" data-cites="schwandt1994">(<a href="#ref-schwandt1994" role="doc-biblioref">Schwandt 1994</a>)</span>. The pragmatist underpinnings in symbolic interactionism emerge here. Thomas and Thomas <span class="citation" data-cites="thomas1928">(<a href="#ref-thomas1928" role="doc-biblioref">1928</a>: 572)</span> proclaim, “If human beings define their situations as real, they are real in their consequences”. Following their theorem, we must try to find what research participants define as real and where their definitions of reality take them. The constructivist approach also fosters our self-consciousness about what we attribute to our subjects and how, when, and why researchers portray these definitions as real. Thus the research products do not constitute the reality of the respondents’ reality. Rather, each is a rendering, one interpretation among multiple interpretations, of a shared or individual reality. That interpretation is objectivist only to the extent that it seeks to construct analyses that show how respondents and the social scientists who study them construct those realities — <em>without viewing those realities as unidimensional, universal, and immutable.</em> Researchers’ attention to detail in the constructivist approach sensitizes them to multiple realities and the multiple viewpoints within them; it does not represent a quest to capture a single reality.</p>
<p>Thus we can recast the obdurate character of social life that <span class="citation" data-cites="blumer1969">Blumer (<a href="#ref-blumer1969" role="doc-biblioref">1969</a>)</span> talks about. In doing so, we change our conception of it from a real world to be discovered, tracked, and categorized to a world <em>made real</em> in the minds and through the words and actions of its members. Thus the grounded theorist constructs an image of <em>a</em> reality, not <em>the</em> reality — that is, objective, true, and external.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, Charmaz <span class="citation" data-cites="charmaz2000">(<a href="#ref-charmaz2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>: 524)</span> frames objectivist grounded theory as believing in some kind of truth:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Objectivist grounded theory accepts the positivistic assumption of an external world that can be described, analyzed, explained, and predicted: truth, but with a small <em>t</em>. That is, objectivist grounded theory is modifiable as conditions change. It assumes that different observers will discover this world and describe it in similar ways That’s correct — to the extent that subjects have comparable experiences (e.g., people with different chronic illnesses may experience uncertainty, intrusive regimens, medical dominance) and viewers bring similar que-tions, perspectives, methods, and, subsequently, concepts to analyze those experiences. Objectivist grounded theorists often share assumptions with their research participants — particularly the professional participants. Perhaps more likely, they assume that respondents share their meanings. For example, Strauss and Corbin’s <span class="citation" data-cites="strauss1990">(<a href="#ref-strauss1990" role="doc-biblioref">1990</a>)</span> discussion of independence and dependence assumes that these terms hold the same meanings for patients as for researchers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charmaz <span class="citation" data-cites="charmaz2000">(<a href="#ref-charmaz2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>: 525)</span> further embeds construvist grounded theory as a way to fulfill Blumer’s symbolic interactionism:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What helps researchers develop a constructivist grounded theory? How might they shape the data collection and analysis phases? Gaining depth and understanding in their work means that they can fulfill Blumer’s <span class="citation" data-cites="blumer1969">(<a href="#ref-blumer1969" role="doc-biblioref">1969</a>)</span> call for “intimate familiarity” with respondents and their worlds <span class="citation" data-cites="lofland1984 lofland1995">(see also <a href="#ref-lofland1984" role="doc-biblioref">Lofland and Lofland 1984</a>, <a href="#ref-lofland1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>. In short, constructing constructivism means seeking meanings — both respondents’ meanings and researchers’ meanings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charmaz <span class="citation" data-cites="charmaz2000">(<a href="#ref-charmaz2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>: 524)</span> on the concretization of procedures from what were orginally meant to be guidelines:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Guidelines such as those offered by <span class="citation" data-cites="strauss1990">Strauss and Corbin (<a href="#ref-strauss1990" role="doc-biblioref">1990</a>)</span> structure objectivist grounded theorists’ work. These guidelines are didactic and prescriptive rather than emergent and interactive. Sanders <span class="citation" data-cites="sanders1995">(<a href="#ref-sanders1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>: 92)</span> refers to grounded theory procedures as “more rigorous than thou instructions about how information should be pressed into a mold”. Strauss and Corbin categorize steps in the process with scientific terms such as axial coding and conditional matrix <span class="citation" data-cites="strauss1987 strauss1990 strauss1994">(<a href="#ref-strauss1987" role="doc-biblioref">Strauss 1987</a>; <a href="#ref-strauss1990" role="doc-biblioref">Strauss and Corbin 1990</a>, <a href="#ref-strauss1994" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a>)</span>. As grounded theory methods become more articulated, categorized, and elaborated, they seem to take on a life of their own. Guidelines turn into procedures and are reified into immutable rules, unlike Glaser and Strauss’s <span class="citation" data-cites="glaser1967">(<a href="#ref-glaser1967" role="doc-biblioref">1967</a>)</span> original flexible strategies. By taking grounded theory methods as prescriptive scientific rules, proponents further the positivist cast to obiectivist grounded theory.</p>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="kelle2005">Kelle (<a href="#ref-kelle2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> is an overview of the Glaser / Strauss and Corbin split.

<p>Highlights a primary impetus behind <span class="citation" data-cites="glaser1967">Glaser and Strauss (<a href="#ref-glaser1967" role="doc-biblioref">1967</a>)</span>, which used political analogies to distinguish between “theoretical capitalists” and “proletariat testers”, and unify the field of sociology by de-centering emphasis on theories developed by “great men”.</p>
<p>A common thread in this paper is sensitivity to the practical challenges of actually doing grounded theory according to Glaser’s approach:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The infeasibility of an inductivist research strategy which demands an empty head (instead of an “open mind”) cannot only be shown by epistemological arguments, it can also be seen in research practice. Especially novices in qualitative research with the strong desire to adhere to what they see as a basic principle and hallmark of Grounded Theory — the “emergence” of categories from the data — often experience a certain difficulty: in open coding the search for adequate coding categories can become extremely tedious and a subject of sometimes numerous and endless team sessions, especially if one hesitates to explicitly introduce theoretical knowledge. The declared purpose to let codes emerge from the data then leads to an enduring proliferation of the number of coding categories which makes the whole process insurmountable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="kelle2005">Kelle (<a href="#ref-kelle2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> basically takes down the original <span class="citation" data-cites="glaser1967">Glaser and Strauss (<a href="#ref-glaser1967" role="doc-biblioref">1967</a>)</span> and subsequent reflection on theoretecal sensitivity <span class="citation" data-cites="glaser1978">(<a href="#ref-glaser1978" role="doc-biblioref">Glaser 1978</a>)</span>. He highlights fundamental contraditions and oversights with regards to the role of theory in grounded theory, specifically with regards to the notion that such research can be accomplished with inductive purity:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Consequently, in the most early version of Grounded Theory the advice to employ theoretical sensitivity to identify theoretical relevant phenomena coexists with the idea that theoretical concepts “emerge” from the data if researchers approach the empirical field with no preconceived theories or hypotheses. Both ideas which have conflicting implications are not integrated with each other in the Discovery book. Furthermore, the concept of theoretical sensitivity is not converted into clear cut methodological rules: it remains unclear how a theoretically sensitive researcher can use previous theoretical knowledge to avoid drowning in the data. If one takes into account the frequent warnings not to force theoretical concepts on the data one gets the impression that a grounded theorist is advised to introduce suitable theoretical concepts ad hoc drawing on implicit theoretical knowledge but should abstain from approaching the empirical data with ex ante formulated hypotheses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="kelle2005">Kelle (<a href="#ref-kelle2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> recognizes that Glaser identified a series of “theoretical families” to help assist with the practical experience of coding. I find it somewhat interesting that many of the terms in these first families are very reminiscient of so-called “natural language”, as used in the wave of cybernets that was contemporary with <span class="citation" data-cites="glaser1978">Glaser (<a href="#ref-glaser1978" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span> and which largely dealt with “expert systems”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the book “Theoretical Sensitivity” (1978) GLASER presents an extended list of terms which can be used for the purpose of theoretical coding loosely structured in the form of so called theoretical “coding families”. Thereby various theoretical concepts stemming from different (sociological, philosophical or everyday) contexts are lumped together, as for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>terms, which relate to the degree of an attribute or property (“degree family”), like “limit”, “range”, “extent”, “amount” etc.,</li>
<li>terms, which refer to the relation between a whole and its elements (“dimension family”), like “element”, “part”, “facet”, “slice”, “sector”, “aspect”, “segment” etc.,</li>
<li>terms, which refer to cultural phenomena (“cultural family”) like “social norms”, “social values”, “social beliefs” etc.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is substantiated by other observations by <span class="citation" data-cites="kelle2005">Kelle (<a href="#ref-kelle2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> that ad hoc coding actually follows <em>implicit</em> theoretical knowledge:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>One of the most crucial differences between GLASER’s and STRAUSS’ approaches of Grounded Theory lies in the fact that STRAUSS and CORBIN propose the utilization of a specified theoretical framework based on a certain understanding of human action, whereas GLASER emphasises that coding as a process of combining “the analyst’s scholarly knowledge and his research knowledge of the substantive field” (1978, p.70) has to be realised ad hoc, which means that it has often to be conducted on the basis of a more or less implicit theoretical background knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and that the Glaserian approach is better suited for more experienced, rather than novice sociologists, who will have internalized the theory that they then apply in their coding.</p>
<p>Kelle then goes on to address how grounded theory can or can not be applied in alignment with inductivist or hypothetic-deductivist reasoning, and raises abductive reasoning an an alternative means of arriving at legitimate and verifiable conclusions. There is too much detail in the paper to copy here.</p>
<p>But here is another nice conclusive gem from the end:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Whereas STRAUSS and CORBIN pay a lot of attention to the question how grounded categories and propositions can be further validated, GLASER’s concept shows at least a gleam of epistemological fundamentalism (or “certism”, LAKATOS 1978) especially in his defence of the inductivism of early Grounded Theory. “Grounded theory looks for what is, not what might be, and therefore needs no test” (GLASER 1992, p.67). Such sentences carry the outmoded idea that empirical research can lead to final certainties and truths and that by using an inductive method the researcher may gain the ability to conceive “facts as they are” making any attempt of further corroboration futile.</p>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="glaser2002">Glaser (<a href="#ref-glaser2002" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span> constitutes a rebuttal to <span class="citation" data-cites="charmaz2000">Charmaz (<a href="#ref-charmaz2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span>. As <span class="citation" data-cites="bryant2003">Bryant (<a href="#ref-bryant2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span> points out in his response to <span class="citation" data-cites="glaser2002">Glaser (<a href="#ref-glaser2002" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span>, it is very angry, polemical and irrational. I don’t want to go too in depth with the fundamental problems with Glaser’s response (see Bryant’s paper for the details), but the gist is that Glaser never really got the message about data being inherently constructed by researchers decisions, actions and circumstances. Glaser seems to continue believing in the inherent neutrality of data as a matter of faith.</p>
<p>This being said, <span class="citation" data-cites="glaser2002">Glaser (<a href="#ref-glaser2002" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span> did highlight the large emphasis on descriptive rather than explanatory potential in Charmaz’s approach. This aligns with my own apprehensions when I try to address the relevance of my work. I tend to use the term “articulate” as a way to frame my work as descriptive, but in a way that lends value, and this very fuzzy distinction between the power of identying the shapes and relationships among things and explaining their causes and effects in a generalizable way (i.e., theories, or explanations), still somehow troubles me. I wonder if Glaser is drawing a false distinction here, and through that, a false prioritization of explanation over description as a desired outcome. This would put my mind at ease, as would dismissing Glaser’s dismissal of people who simply don’t know how to do the “real” grounded theory (which, in his mind, include all feminist and critical researchers).</p>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="on-the-utility-of-grounded-theory">On the <em>utility</em> of grounded theory</h5>
<p>I completely agree with this statement from Clarke <span class="citation" data-cites="clarke2003">(<a href="#ref-clarke2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>: 555)</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>To address the needs and desires for empirical understandings of the complex and heterogeneous worlds emerging through new world orderings, new methods are requisite (Haraway 1999). I believe some such methods should be epistemologically/ ontologically based in the pragmatist soil that has historically nurtured symbolic interactionism and grounded theory. Through Mead, an interactionist grounded theory has always had the capacity to be distinctly perspectival in ways fully com patible with what are now understood as situated knowledges. This fundamental and always already postmodern edge of a grounded theory founded in symbolic interactionism makes it worth renovating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is super interesting, and really contextualizes how Strauss imagined grounded theory to be <em>useful</em> for him:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Some years ago, Katovich and Reese (1993:400–405) interestingly argued that Strauss’s negotiated order and related work recuperatively pulled the social around the postmodern turn through its methodological [grounded theoretical] recognition of the partial, tenuous, shifting, and unstable nature of the empirical world and its constructedness. I strongly agree and would argue that <strong>Strauss also furthered this “postmodernization of the social” through his conceptualizations of social worlds and arenas as modes of understanding the deeply situated yet always also fluid orga nizational elements of negotiations.</strong> He foreshadowed what later came to be known as postmodern assumptions: the instability of situations; characteristic changing, porous boundaries of both social worlds and arenas; social worlds seen as mutually constitutive/coproduced through negotiations taking place in arenas; negotiations as central social processes hailing that “things can always be otherwise”; and so on. Significantly, negotiations constitute discourses that also signal micropolitics of power as well as “the usual” meso/macrostructural elements—power in its more fluid forms (e.g., Foucault 1979, 1980). Through integrating the social worlds/arenas/ negotiations framework with grounded theory as a new conceptual infrastructure, I hope to sustain and extend the methodological contribution of grounded theory to understanding and elaborating what has been meant by “the social” in social life — before, during, and after the postmodern turn.</p>

<p>It also echoes Charmaz’s vision of grounded theory as a powerful too, and Bryant’s <span class="citation" data-cites="bryant2003">(<a href="#ref-bryant2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span> call to “look at what Glaser and Strauss actually did, rather than what they claimed — and continued to claim — they were doing” to uncover “the basis for a powerful research approach”. <span class="citation" data-cites="bryant2003">Bryant (<a href="#ref-bryant2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span> further cites <span class="citation" data-cites="baszanger1997">Baszanger and Dodier (<a href="#ref-baszanger1997" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span>, who characterize grounded theory as a method “consisting of accumulating a series of individual cases, of analyzing them as a combination between different logics of action that coexist not only in the field under consideration, but even within these individuals or during their encounters”. <span class="citation" data-cites="bryant2003">Bryant (<a href="#ref-bryant2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span> summarizes this by stating that “[t]he aim of such methods is generalization rather than totalization, with the objective of producing”a combinative inventory of possible situations”.</p>

<p>Unique to this approach has been, first, its requiring that analysis begin as soon as there are data. Coding begins immediately, and theorizing based on that coding does as well, however provisionally (Glaser 1978). Second, “sampling” is driven not necessarily (or not only) by attempts to be “representative” of some social body or population (or its heterogeneities) but especially and explicitly by theoretical con cerns that have emerged in the provisional analysis. Such “theoretical sampling” focuses on finding new data sources (persons or things) that can best explicitly ad dress specific theoretically interesting facets of the emergent analysis. Theoretical sampling has been integral to grounded theory from the outset, remains a fundamen tal strength of this analytic approach, and is crucial for the new situational analyses.</p>

<p>A constructivist approach necessitates a relationship with respondents in which they can cast their stories in their terms. It means listening to their stories with openness to feeling and experience. … Furthermore, one-shot interviewing lends itself to a partial, sanitized view of experience, cleaned up for public discourse. The very structure of an interview may preclude private thoughts and feelings from emerging. Such a structure reinforces whatever proclivities a respondent has to tell only the public version of the story. Researchers’ sustained involvement with research participants lessens these problems.</p>

<p>Interviewers ask respondents a series of preestablished questions with a limited set of response categories. The interview records responses according to a preestablished coding scheme.</p>
<p>Instructions to interviewers often follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never get involved in long explanations of the study; use the standard explanation provided by the supervisor.</li>
<li>Never deviate from the study introduction, sequence of questions, or question wording.</li>
<li>Never let another person interrupt the interview; do not let another person answer for the respondent or offer his or her opinions on the question.</li>
<li>Never suggest an answer or agree or disagree with an answer. Do not give the respondent any idea of your personal views on the topic of the question or the survey.</li>
<li>Never interpret the meaning of a question; just repeat the question and give instructions or clarifications that are provided in training or by the supervisors.</li>
<li>Never improvise, such as by assing answer categories or making wording changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The interviewer must establish a “balanced rapport”, being casual and friendly while also directive and impersonal. Interviewers must also perfect a style of “interested listening” that rewards respondents’ participation but does not evaluate their responses.</p>

<p>However, <span class="citation" data-cites="fontana2000">Fontana and Frey (<a href="#ref-fontana2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span> also draws attention to crticism of highly engaged interviewing approaches, which seem to equate closeness with the respondent as getting closer to their “true self”, and which may not actually be fixed (especially in the context of the artificial environment of the interview setting). Critiques of such “closeness” use the term “romantic” or “crusading” as epithets. Moreover, there is additional reference to the culturally-embedded assumption that interviews are necessarily valuable sources of information, as if speaking ones mind can adequately convey one’s thoughts and experiences — this is criticized as a particularly western approach to information extraction surrounding internalized and externalized thoughts and behaviour, as instilled through participation in the “interview society” addressed earlier in the text.</p>

<p>Crucially, focus groups involve the interaction of group participants with each other as well as with the moderator, and it is the collection of this kind of interactive data which distinguishes the focus group from the one-to-one interview (c.f. Morgan 1988), as well as from procedures which use multiple participants but do not permit interactive discussion (c.f. Stewart and Shamdasani 1990). The ‘hallmark’ of focus groups, then, is the ‘explicit use of group interaction to produce data and insights that would be less accessible without the interaction found in a group’ (Morgan 1997: 2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="wilkinson1998">Wilkinson (<a href="#ref-wilkinson1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span> identifies three key features of focus group methods:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>providing access to participants’ own language, concepts and concerns;</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>“The relatively free flow of discussion and debate between members of a focus group offers an excellent opportunity for hearing ‘the language and vernacular used by respondents’”</li>
<li>Useful for gaining insight into participants’ conceptual worlds on their own terms</li>
<li>“Sometimes, the participants even offer the researcher a ‘translation’ of unfamiliar terms or concepts”</li>
<li>“Focus group interactions reveal not only shared ways of talking, but also shared experiences, and shared ways of making sense of these experiences. The researcher is offered an insight into the commonly held assumptions, concepts and meanings that constitute and inform participants’ talk about their experiences.”</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>encouraging the production of more fully articulated accounts;</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>“In focus groups people typically disclose personal details, reveal discrediting information, express strong views and opinions. They elaborate their views in response to encouragement, or defend them in the face of challenge from other group members: focus groups which ‘take off’ may even, like those run by Robin Jarrett (1993: 194) have ‘the feel of rap sessions with friends’.”</li>
<li>“Even when bcus group participants are not acquainted in advance, the interactive nature of the group means that participants ask questions of, disagree with, and challenge each other, thus serving ‘to elicit the elaboration of responses’ (Merton 1987: 555).”</li>
<li>“Other ethical issues in focus group research stem from group dynamics, insofar as participants can collaborate or collude effectively to intimidate and/or silence a particular member, or to create a silence around a particular topic or issue, for example. In such cases, it falls to the group moderator to decide whether/how to intervene, and it can be difficult to balance such conflicting goals as ensuring the articulation of accounts, supporting individuals, and challenging offensive statements.”</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>and offering an opportunity to observe the process of collective sense-making.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Focus groups also offer an opportunity for researchers to see exactly how views are constructed, expressed, defended and (sometimes) modified during the course of conversations with others, 1.e. to observe the process of collective sense-making in action. This is likely to be of particular interest to researchers working within a social constructionist framework, who do not view beliefs, ideas, opinions and understandings as generated by individuals in splendid isolation, but rather as built in interaction with others, in specific social contexts: as Radley and Billig (1996: 223) say, ‘thinking is a socially shared activity’. In a focus group, people are confronted with the need to make collective sense of their individual experiences and beliefs (Morgan and Spanish 1984: 259).</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="wilkinson1998">Wilkinson (<a href="#ref-wilkinson1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span> addresses opportunities and challenges in analyzing focus group data using content analysis and ethnographic techniques.</p>
<p>With regards to content analysis:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>the main advantages of content analysis are to allow for a relatively systematic treatment of the data and to enable its presentation in summary form. … the researcher has first to decide on the unit of analysis: this could be the whole group, the group dynamics, the individual participants, or the participants’ utterances</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Morgan (1997) proposes three distinct ways of coding focus group data: noting whether each group discussion contains a given code; noting whether each participant mentions a given code; and noting all mentions of a given code (i.e.&nbsp;across groups or participants). Once the data have been coded in one (or more) of these ways, the question of whether to quantify them is a further issue. Morgan (1993) argues the value of simple ‘descriptive counts’ of codes (stopping short of using inferential statistical tests, whose assumptions are unlikely to be met in focus groups)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And with regards to ethnographic analysis:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Its main advantage is to permit a detailed interpretative account of the everyday social processes of communication, talk and action occurring within the focus group. The key issue in ethnographic analysis is how to select the material to present (whether this is framed up as ‘themes’, ‘discourses’, or simply as illustrative quotations), without violating the ‘spirit’ of the group, and without losing sight of the specific context within which the material was generated. … A particular challenge is how to preserve the interactive nature of focus group data: a surprising limitation of published focus group research is the rarity with which group interactions are analysed and reported ( c.f. Carey and Smith 1994, Kitzinger 1994a). Extracts from focus group data are most commonly presented as if they were one-to-one interview data, often with no indication that more than one person is present; still more rarely does interaction per se constitute the analytic focus.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="kitzinger1994">Kitzinger (<a href="#ref-kitzinger1994" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a>)</span> elaborates on the interactive nature of focus groups, which she identifies as the methods’ core feature.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Focus groups are group discussions organised to explore a specific set of issues sucb as people’s views and experiences … The group is ‘focused’ in the sense that it involves some kind of collective activity - such as viewing a film, examining a single health education message or simply debating a particular set of questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Even when group work is explicitly included as part of the research it is often simply employed as a convenient way to illustrate a theory generated by other methods or as a cost-effective technique for interviewing several people at once. Reading some such reports it is hard to believe that there was ever more than one person in the room at the same time. This criticism even applies to many studies which explicitly identify their methodology as ‘focus group discussion’ — in spite of the fact that the distinguishing feature of focus groups is supposed to be the use of interaction as part of the research data.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It would be naive, however, to assume that group data is by definition ‘natural’ in the sense that it would have occurred without the group having been convened for this purpose. It is important to note that although, at times, the focus groups may approximate to participant observation the focus groups are artifidally set up situations. Rather than assuming the group session unproblematically and inevitably reflects ‘everyday interactions’ (although sometimes it will) the group sbould be used to encourage people to engage with one another, verbally formulate their ideas and draw out the cognitive structures which previously have been unarticulated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the active role of the facilitator:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Sessions were conducted in a relaxed fashion with minimal intervention from the facilitator - at least at first. This allowed the facilitator to ‘find her feet’ and permitted the research participants to set the priorities. However, the researcber was never passive. Trying to maximise interaction between participants could lead to a more interventionist style: urging debate to continue beyond the stage it might otberwise have ended, challenging people’s taken for granted reality and encouraging them to discuss the inconsistencies both between participants and within their own thinking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the role of the presentation or activity:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Such exercises not only provided invaluable data from each group but allow for some cross-compadsons between groups. Each discussion session has its own dynamic and direction — when it comes to analysis it is extremely useful to have a common external reference point such as that provided by the card game or the use of vignettes (Kban and Manderson 1992).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On complementary interactions:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The excbange between the research participants not only allows the researcher to understand which advertisement they are talking about but to gather data on their shared perception of that image.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Brainstorming and loose word association was a frequent feature of the research sessions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>people’s knowledge and attitudes are not entirely encapsulated in reasoned responses to direct questions. Everyday forms of communication such as anecdotes, jokes or loose word association may tell us as much, if not more, about what people ‘know’. In this sense focus groups ‘reach the parts that other methods cannot reach’ - revealing dimensions of understanding that often remain untapped by the more conventional one-to-one interview or questionnaire.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In addition to the advantages discussed above fo exampie, discussing whether they had the ‘right’ to know if another child in the piay group bad had virus asserted that ‘you think of your own first’. It was this phrase, and these sort of sentiments, which seemed to capture their consent and resulted in nods of agreement round the group and assertions that ‘that’s right’ and ‘of course’. Indeed, it was often the strength of the collective reaction that highlighted the specific context within which the research participants experienced AIDS information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On argumentative interactions:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>the group process however, is not only about consensus and the articulation of group norms and experiences. Differences between individuals within the group are equally important and, in any case, rarely disappear from view. Regardless of how they are selected, the research participants in any one group are never entirely homogenous. Participants do not just agree with each other — they also misunderstand one another, question one another, try to persuade each other of the justice of their own point of view and sometimes they vehemently disagree.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Such unexpected dissent led them to clarify why they thpught as they did, often identifying aspects of their personal experience which bad altered their opinions or specific occasions which had made them re-think their point of view. Had the data been collected by interviews the researcber might have been faced with ‘arm chair’ theorizing about the causes of such difference but in a focus group these can be explored ‘in situ’ with the help of the research participants.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Close attention to the ways in which research participants tell stories <em>to one another</em> aiso prevents the researcber from assuming that she knows ‘the meaning’ of any particular anecdote or account.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="parker2006">Parker and Tritter (<a href="#ref-parker2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span> discuss “key issues relating to the complexity and necessity of considering sampling issues within the context of focus group research and the implications this has for the collection and analysis of resultant data.”</p>
<p>Identifies some common logistical impetus for focus groups, relating to acquisition of funding:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Increasing pressure from research funding organizations to adopt multiple-method research strategies and the fact that focus groups generate far more data than a range of other methods in relation to face-to-face contact between researchers and participants, has added to [the method’s popularity].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Calls out the conflation between focus groups and group interviews:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A similarly pervasive trend in and around academic discussion of qualitative research methods is that focus groups are sometimes seen as synonymous with group interviews and it is this issue which constitutes our second point of contention. … In keeping with the views of a number of other writers in this field, we are of the opinion that there is a fundamental difference between these two research techniques and that the critical point of distinction surrounds the role of the researcher and her/ his relationship to the researched (Smithson, 2000). In group interviews the researcher adopts an ‘investigative’ role: asking questions, controlling the dynamics of group discussion, often engaging in dialogue with specific participants. This is premised on the mechanics of one-to-one, qualitative, in-depth interviews being replicated on a broader (collective) scale. A relatively straightforward scenario ensues: the researcher asks questions, the respondents relay their ‘answers’ back to the researcher. In focus groups the dynamics are different. Here, the researcher plays the role of ‘facilitator’ or ‘moderator’; that is, facilitator/moderator of group discussion between participants, not between her/himself and the participants. Hence, where focus groups are concerned, the researcher takes a peripheral, rather than a centre-stage role for the simple reason that it is the inter-relational dynamics of the participants that are important, not the relationship between researcher and researched (see Kitzinger, 1994a; Johnson, 1996).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Part of the problem of achieving this kind of interactional synergy in data collection is that, despite their collective interests, participants may not always be keen to engage with each other, or alternatively, may know each other so well that interaction is based on patterns of social relations that have little to do with the research intent of the focus group. The need to consider the impact on interaction of the constitution of the focus group requires that close attention be paid to methods (and outcomes) of recruit ment. … issues of sampling and selection are likely to prove crucial in relation to the form and quality of interaction in a focus group and therefore the kinds of data one gathers and the extent to which participants share their opinions, attitudes and life experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A large part of what follows is an extremely honest account of the challenges involved in recruiting participants to sit for focus groups. The pressure on students to recruit their friends impacted their views on what views were represented and not represented. Moreover, they draw attention to the role of timing and convenience in recruitment strategy, and representativeness of expressed viewpoints.</p>
<p>I found it hard to take notes on this since it comes off as a continuous stream of conciousness. However it should still be read from top to bottom to get a sense of practical challenges that are not commonly addressed, save for among veterans and in private circles.</p>

<p>Herbert BLUMER invented the term “sensitizing concepts” to describe theoretical terms which “lack precise reference and have no bench marks which allow a clean cut identification of a specific instance” (1954, p.7).

<li>This relates to the paired notions of decodng when we reflect on a passage to decipher its core meaning, and encoding when we determine its appropriate code and label it <span class="citation" data-cites="saldana2016">(<a href="#ref-saldana2016" role="doc-biblioref">Saldaña 2016</a>: 5)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Coding “generates the bones of your analysis. … [I]ntegration will assemble those bones into a working skeleton” (<span class="citation" data-cites="charmaz2014">Charmaz (<a href="#ref-charmaz2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>: 113, quoted in <span class="citation" data-cites="saldana2016">Saldaña (<a href="#ref-saldana2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>: 9)</li>
<li>To codify is to arrange things in a systematic order, to make something part of a system or classification, to categorize
<ul>
<li>What I sometimes refer to as arranging the code tree</li>
<li>What <span class="citation" data-cites="saldana2016">Saldaña (<a href="#ref-saldana2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> refers to as categories, I tend to refer to as stubs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Categories are arranged into themes or concepts, which in turn lead to assertions or theories</li>
</ul>
<p>Pre-coding techniques: - Data layout - Separation between lines or paragraphs may hold significant meaning - Putting interviewer words in square brackets or capital letters - Semantic markup - Bold, italics, underline, highlight - Meant to identify “codable moments” worthy of attention (<span class="citation" data-cites="boyatzis1998">Boyatzis (<a href="#ref-boyatzis1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span>, as referenced in <span class="citation" data-cites="saldana2016">Saldaña (<a href="#ref-saldana2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>: 20) - Relates to <span class="citation" data-cites="saldana2016">Saldaña (<a href="#ref-saldana2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>: 22’s prompt: “what strikes you?” - Preliminary jottings - Tri-column exercise with the text on the left, first impression or preliminary code in the middle, and code on the right, after <span class="citation" data-cites="liamputtong2005">Liamputtong and Ezzy (<a href="#ref-liamputtong2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>: 270-273.</p>
<p>Asking questions back to the interviewer, or participating in an imagined dialogue. I imagine this might be useful in situations where the time to hold an interview is quite limited and I have to work with limited responses that don’t touch on everything I want to cover. The form of questions maintains my tentativity, my unwillingness to commit or assume their responses, and opens the door for their own responses in rebuttal.</p>
<p>Magnitude coding can be applied to tag positive/negative attitudes, but also other gradients like hard/soft, technical/social skills. May be useful to apply symbols using my little 12-button keypad.</p>
<p>Can also use colons to identify a magnitude associated with a code’s usage, as per 88-89.</p>
<p>Note: create a qc issue for sub-documents, for identifying sections of a document that are especially relevant and hiding less relevant sections. I don’t necessarily want to delete these lines, but I may want to hide them from view. Maybe this is possible using vscode, outside of qc (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/72954133).</p>
<p>In lieu of initial/open coding, I think I will opt to devise sensitizing concepts, which may amalgamate as memos. I could use the prefix “SC:” to denote sensitizing concepts.</p>
<p>What saldana refers to as “concept coding” is what I have previously referred to as “theoretical coding” to a certain extent. It’s a form of lumping, identifying specific instances under the label of cohesive concepts.</p>
<p>From Clarke <span class="citation" data-cites="clarke2003">(<a href="#ref-clarke2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>: 558)</span> on process coding:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In a traditional grounded theory study, the key or basic social process is typically articulated in gerund form connoting ongoing action at an abstract level. Around this basic process are then constellated the particular and distinctive conditions, strategies, actions, and practices engaged in by human and nonhuman actors in volved with/in the process and their consequences. For example, subprocesses of disciplining the scientific study of reproduction include formalizing a scientific disci pline, gleaning fiscal support for research, producing contraceptives and other techno scientific products, and handling any social controversies the science provokes (such as cloning and stem cell research).</p>

<section id="the-constant-comparative-method" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-constant-comparative-method">The constant comparative method</h4>
<p>The constant comparative method is based on action codes, similar to what <span class="citation" data-cites="saldana2016">Saldaña (<a href="#ref-saldana2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> refers to as process codes. According to Charmaz <span class="citation" data-cites="charmaz2000">(<a href="#ref-charmaz2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>: 515)</span>: &gt; The constant comparative method of grounded theory means (a) comparing different people (such as their views, situations, actions, accounts, and experiences), (b) comparing data from the same individuals with themselves at different points in time, (c) comparing incident with incident, (d) comparing data with categori, and (e) comparing categories with other categories.</p>
<p>My initial impression is that this is very well suited for Stake’s <span class="citation" data-cites="stake2006">(<a href="#ref-stake2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span> multicase study framework, specifically with regards to his notion of the case-quintain dilemma.

<section id="situational-analysis" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="situational-analysis">Situational analysis</h4>
<p>Situational analysis originates from Strauss’s social worlds/arenas/negotiations framework. From Clarke <span class="citation" data-cites="clarke2003">(<a href="#ref-clarke2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>: 554)</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Building on and extending Strauss’s work, situational analyses offer three main cartographic approaches:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>situational maps that lay out the major human, nonhuman, discursive, and other elements in the research situation of concern and provoke analyses of relations among them;</li>
<li>social worlds/arenas maps that lay out the collective actors, key nonhuman elements, and the arena(s) of commitment within which they are engaged in ongoing negotiations, or mesolevel interpretations of the situation; and</li>
<li>positional maps that lay out the major positions taken, and not taken, in the data vis-à-vis particular discursive axes of variation and difference, con cern, and controversy surrounding complicated issues in the situation.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Clarke <span class="citation" data-cites="clarke2003">(<a href="#ref-clarke2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>: 560)</span> identifies the main purpose of situational data as a way of “opening up” the data, figuing out where and how to enter:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Although they may do so, a major and perhaps the major use for them is “opening up” the data –— interrogating them in fresh ways. As researchers, we constantly confront the problem of “where and how to enter.” Doing situational analyses offers new paths into the full array of data sources and lays out in various ways what you have to date. These approaches should be considered analytic exercises — constituting an ongoing research “work out” of sorts—well into the research trajectory. Their most important outcome is provoking the researcher to analyze more deeply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She emphasizes that this is meant to stimulate thinking, and should always be paired with comprehensive memoing before, during and after situation mapping excercises.</p>
<p>A key feature that I think is invaluable is the ability to uncover the <em>sites of silence</em>, or the things that I as a researcher suspect are there but are not readily visible in my evidence. Situational analysis is useful for drawing out the thousand pound gorillas in the room that no one wants to talk about, and is therefore important for identifying things to address during continual data collection, as is one of the (often ignored) central pillars of grounded theory:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The fourth and last caveat is perhaps the most radical. As trained scholars in our varied fields, usually with some theoretical background, we may also suspect that certain things may be going on that have not yet explicitly appeared in our data. As ethically accountable researchers, I believe we need to attempt to articulate what we see as the <em>sites of silence</em> in our data. What seems present but unarticulated? What thousand-pound gorillas are sitting around in our situations of concern that nobody has bothered to mention as yet (Zerubavel 2002)? Why not? How might we pursue these sites of silence and ask about the gorillas without putting words in the mouths of our participants? These are very important directions for theoretical sampling. That is, the usefulness of the approaches elucidated here consists partly in helping the researcher think systematically through the design of research, espe cially decisions regarding future data to collect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The process is remarkably similar to <a href="https://wiki.zackbatist.info/index.php/February_5,_2020_brainstorm">the brainstorming excercise</a> I did with Costis one time. Starts by articulating the actors involved, their roles and relationships, the things they do, the things they make.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The goal here is to lay out as best one can all the human and nonhuman elements in the situation of concern of the research broadly conceived. In the Meadian sense, the questions are: Who and what are in this situation? Who and what matters in this situation? What elements “make a difference” in this situation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After jotting these down on a canvas or whiteboard, arrange them into more concrete categories. In each category, refer to examples or specific instances. Concepts can occur in multiple categories. By arranging these concepts, grouping them thematically, spatially, and through relationships and associations with arrows or lines (presumably, with labels indicating the nature of these relationships), this provides the researcher with a viable way of unlocking new pathways to think through their data. I imagine this will be especially helpful when arranging or re-arranging the coding tree.</p>
<p>Clarke <span class="citation" data-cites="clarke2003">(<a href="#ref-clarke2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>: 569-570)</span> also dedicates a few paragraphs to relational forms of analysis using this technique:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Relations among the various elements are key. You might not think to ask about certain relations, but if you do what I think of as quick and dirty relational analyses with the situational map, they can be revealing. The procedure here is to take each element in turn and think about it in relation to each other element on the map. One does this by circling one element and mentally or literally drawing lines, one at a time, between it and every other ele ment on the map and specifying the nature of the relationship by describing the nature of that line.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You could highlight (in blue perhaps) that organization’s perspectives on all the other actors to see which actors are attended to <em>and which are not</em>, as well as the actual contents of the organization’s discourses on its “others.” Silences can thus be made to speak.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clarke <span class="citation" data-cites="clarke2003">(<a href="#ref-clarke2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>: 569)</span> On how to generate memos from situational analysis:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Each map in turn should lead to a memo about the relations diagrammed. At early stages of analysis, such memos should be partial and tentative, full of questions to be answered about the nature and range of particular sets of social relations, rather than being answers in and of themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clarke <span class="citation" data-cites="clarke2003">(<a href="#ref-clarke2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>: 570)</span> addresses the energy or mood required to do this kind of work, which is reminiscient of Yin’s <span class="citation" data-cites="yin2014">(<a href="#ref-yin2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>: 73-74)</span> description of the “mental and emotional exhaustion at the end of each fieldwork day, due to the depletion of ‘analytic energy’ associated with being attention on your toes.” Interesting that the mention of “freshness” is brought up in the context of Glaser’s <em>tabla rasa</em> approach to grounded theory.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As a practical matter, doing the situational map and then the relational analyses it organizes can be tiring and/or anxiety producing and/or elating. Work on it until you feel stale and then take a break. This is not the same order of work as entering bibliographic citations. The fresher you are, the more you can usually see. Glaser <span class="citation" data-cites="glaser1978">(<a href="#ref-glaser1978" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>: 18-35)</span> cautions against prematurely discussing emergent ideas –— that we might not necessarily benefit from talking about everything right away but rather from reflection — and memoing. I strongly agree, especially about early even if quick and dirty memoing. But we all must find our own ways of working best. For most, the work of this map occurs over time and through multiple efforts and multiple memos.</p>

<li>Observation notes: Concrete and detailed, accurate renditions of things I see, hear, feel and taste, and so on. Remain close to the scene as experienced through the senses.</li>
<li>Methodological notes: Messages to self about how to collect data — who to talk to, what to wear, when to get in touch.</li>

<li>Personal notes: Uncensored feeling statements about the research, the people I’m talking to, my doubts, anxieties, pleasures.
