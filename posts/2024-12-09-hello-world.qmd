Welcome to the website for my CITF Postdoc! This will serve as a hub for documenting and sharing my work. I decided to do this as a way of managing and sharing always-updated drafts of research protocols with my supervisor and team members, but it is also generally useful for keeping my thoughts organized. I will also use this blog section to write my thoughts as the project progresses.
