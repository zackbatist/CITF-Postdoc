Some highlights from this week:

- I met with Isabel for our biweekly update. We talked about challenges involved in introducing my work to epidemiologists, and practiced some techniques for communicating what my project is about.
- I made some revisions to my ethics protocol in response to the feedback provided by the IRB. Currently trying to resolve a technical problem with the online portal that processes these applications.
- I submitted a peer-review.
- I followed up on some translation work for SNAP.
- I continued with my methodology notes.
