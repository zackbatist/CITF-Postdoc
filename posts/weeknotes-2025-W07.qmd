This week I continued my methodological readings.
Today I got some requests for minor modifications to my REB protocol, which will be rather painless to implement.

I also attended the Public Health day, a student conference where grad students presented their practicum research.
I really enjoyed engaging with the students at the poster session, I actually learned quite a lot.

Next week I'll try to round off my methodology readings in anticipation of my REB application being approved by the end of this month.
