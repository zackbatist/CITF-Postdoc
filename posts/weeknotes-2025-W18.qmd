This week I was largely focused on revising the research protcol and submitting an ethics amendment for a slight pivot to the overall project.
I also co-hosted a focus group among practicum and thesis students regarding accessing data from the CITF databank.
Also made some significant progress on this ICF/data governance paper.

It's been more relaxed now that the term is over, and some of the more lively personalities in the office are away for various reasons.
So it's been really quiet and calm in general.

Some additional developments in the archaeology realm of my life too, but I do not want to conflate those with this work.
