But first it would be prudent to very briefly describe qualitative coding as a method.
Qualitative coding involves systematically annotating segments of interview transcripts and observational records, and is often paired with reflexive writing and conceptual modelling exercises.
Coding essentially bridges what study participants do and say with elements of an emerging theory.
By creating codes that abstract the interview responses, I am able to (a) render disparate instantiations of those codes as comparable entities that fit within a broader model and (b) think through the data and consider what elements of the theory need to be accounted for and iterated upon.
In other words, it's an important locus of theory-building that grounds my own expertise as a scholar of scientific practice through references to what research subjects actually say and do.



There are a variety of computer-assisted qualitative data analysis systems (CAQDAS) out there, most of which are proprietary.
I used MaxQDA throughout my dissertation, and I thought it was pretty good.
It probably has the best user interface of the bunch, but it leaves much to be desired for data portability.
Everything was based in a poorly document sqlite database, and while you _can_ access that directly, I do not recommend it (based on personal experience).
QualCoder is a great open source alternative, whose database is more accessible and more effectively documented, but it maintains the same design choices as most other CAQDAS.

qc is developed by Chris Proctor, who is a computer scientist, educator and education researcher at SUNY Buffalo's School of Education.
Chris's unique role as an education researcher concerned computational literacy among non-computer scientists ensures that qc is being developed from a position of methodological understanding.^[Education is one of the fields that most heavily relies on qualitative data analysis (QDA) methods.]
That being said, QDA is extremely flexible and there are as many ways of applying QDA as there are QDA projects.
So as one of the first users, I've been in touch with Chris to figure out ways to improve the system and make it more generally accessible.


qc is fantastic at handling and processing data, but it has essentially no visual interface.
This is a problem for me because at some point I really need to look at what I've got in order to refine my code system and draw more meaning from the data I've collected and processed so far.
So I'm developing qc-viz as a way of supporting this kind of iterative theory-building.
