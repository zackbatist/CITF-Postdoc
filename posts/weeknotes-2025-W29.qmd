- Finished open coding for the interviews I've done thus far.
- Started re-arranging the codebook.
- Wrote an intermittent report, which is basically a series of memos to keep me writing in a thematic way and to keep me on my toes as I code.
- Worked on the CIHR project grant.

- Submitted revisions for [one paper from my dissertation](https://zackbatist.info/locating-creative-agency/).
- Update [the preprint](http://zackbatist.info/fuzzy-concrete) for another paper with some more visual flair.
