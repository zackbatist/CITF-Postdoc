Did my first interview, it went really well!
We scheduled a follow-up for next month.
I finished transcribing and processing the interview.
I also started doing some open / initial coding and memoing.

I made a significant update to the [QDA protocol](../qda-protocol.qmd) and [data management plan](../data-management.qmd).

I developed another case file and made more concrete progress on planning subsequent interviews.
I also obtained informed consent from additional potential participants.

Over the weekend and outside work hours I made significant progress on a revisions to a paper deriving from my thesis.
I will be ready to submit the revisions this week.
