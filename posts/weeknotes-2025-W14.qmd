This was a really tough week. I did not sleep well at all.

- Continued refining the guide for my first interview.
- Writing and editing memos new.
- Did an overview of graph databases with other members of the CITF team, to explore their potential utility for us.
- Did [my presentation for the MCHI research group](../MCHI-2025/index.qmd), where I basically talked about my research goals and methods.
- I started drafting a blog post about tech fetishism among academics.
- Worked a bit more on my revisions for the [AAP paper](https://zackbatist.info/fuzzy-concrete) (got a 2-week extension).
- Connected with other coool postdocs at the monthly casual meetup.
- Participated in the monthly SSLA meeting.
- Attended [a talk on pragmatic clinical trials](https://www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/channels/event/building-capacity-pragmatic-clinical-trials-canada-363513), which I thought was really interesting.
