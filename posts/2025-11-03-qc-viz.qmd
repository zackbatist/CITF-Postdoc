Over the past month or so I've been vibe-coding [qc-viz](https://github.com/zackbatist/qc-viz), a workflow to support analysis and visualization of my qualitative codes.
This post describes qc-viz, the problem it tries to solve, and the process of building it.

## What is qc-viz?

qc-viz is a workflow for processing data stored in a [qc](https://qualitative-coding.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) database and generating a static site to support visual queries.
It's built as a lua filter that takes json files exported from qc, wraps values within html divs, styles those elements according to a custom stylesheet, and applies some javascript to dynamically re-arrange how the data are arranged on the page.

Here are some of the key features:

- **Interactive filtering** by code categories and individual codes
- **Multi-speaker filtering** with checkbox selection
- **Toggle uncoded segments** visibility
- **Export** to CSV, JSON, Excel, HTML, and PDF with filter parameters documented
- **Collapsible sections** with persistent state between sessions
- **Color-coded tags** for easy code identification
- **Directory-based exclusion** of sensitive or incomplete files

qc-viz is an offline system that spits out a self-contained static site, which you can serve from the file system and easily share with colleagues.
It is highly configurable and automatically adapts to [any codebook you throw at it](https://qualitative-coding.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manuscript.html#organizing-the-codebook).

Explicit guidelines on how to install and use qc-viz are available in the [readme](https://github.com/zackbatist/qc-viz/README.md).

## What is qc?

qc-viz is built atop qc, which is a computer-assisted qualitative data analysis system that runs on the command line and which is [explicitly designed with a computational mindset](https://qualitative-coding.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manuscript.html#background).
In this spirit, qc embraces the [unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) by taking on a limited scope: it simply assigns codes to relevant lines of an interview transcript, writes those assignments to a database, and enables basic lookups of those relationships.
It's up to the user to extend from such basic functionality by extracting the data and embedding qc into a broader computational ecosystem.

In practice, qc allows users to export all relevant data into json format, which can then be picked up in another environment.
I basically developed qc-viz as a system that leverages these json exports to generate a project-specific webpage that supports further analysis beyond the command line interface.

You can read a more comprehensive overview in Chris' peer-reviewed article published in the Journal of Open Source Software: [10.21105/joss.07031](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.07031).

## Development process

qc-viz is a vibe-coded system.
I started using Google Gemini for initial iterations, and thanks to suggestions from colleagues (including [Tom Scheinfeldt](https://hcommons.social/@foundhistory/115425373980090466)) I shifted over to Claude.
Claude is much better suited for coding due on its enhanced ability to track iterative versions and its superior code commenting.

As someone who is technical enough to know what's going on but who doesn't really have the chops to develop such a complex system from scratch, this was a very empowering experience.
Not only was I able to make something from nothing, but I was able to solidify my really basic understanding of lua, a scripting language that I've been dabbling with over the past year and a bit.
The code is also much better documented than I could ever have possibly accomplished on my own, which makes it painless to verify what's going on and for others or my future self to make additional changes down the road.

I strongly encourage any readers to take a look at Tom's recent blog series about vibe-coding in practice, as well as Shawn Graham's book [Practical Necromancy for Beginners](https://thedigitalpress.org/practical-necromancy-for-beginners/), which is a great introductory guide on local and methodological use of AI systems, including an account of the tradeoffs involved.
