Over the past few weeks I've been vibe-coding a workflow to support analysis and visualization of my qualitative codes.
Qualitative coding involves systematically annotating segments of interview transcripts and observational records, and is often paired with reflexive writing and conceptual modelling exercises.
Coding essentially bridges what study participants do and say with elements of an emerging theory.
By creating codes that abstract the interview responses, I am able to (a) render disparate instantiations of those codes as comparable entities that fit within a broader model and (b) think through the data and consider what elements of the theory need to be accounted for and iterated upon.
In other words, it's a locus of theory-building, where the participants experiences and my own expertise as a scholar of scientific practice converge.

I will post again with more information on my coding process, but for now I just want to highlight some aspects of the workflow that are very tool-dependent, and which served as the impetus for my development of qc-viz.

There are a variety of computer-assisted qualitative data analysis systems (CAQDAS) out there, most of which are proprietary.
I used MaxQDA throughout my dissertation, and I thought it was pretty good.
It probably has the best user interface of the bunch, but it leaves much to be desired for data portability.
Everything was based in a poorly document sqlite database, and while you _can_ access that directly, I do not recommend it (based on personal experience).
QualCoder is a great open source alternative, whose database is more accessible and more effectively documented, but it maintains the same design choices as most other CAQDAS.

Qualitative-Coding, or qc, developed by Chris Proctor, is different.
qc is a command line interface, and is explicitly designed with a computational mindset.
This reflects Chris' position as a computer scientist, as an educator, and as an education researcher whose main interests are concerned with computational literacy among non-computer scientists.
Education is basically one of the fields that most heavily relies on QDA, so Chris is making this tool from a position of methodological understanding.
That being said, QDA is extremely flexible and there are as many ways of applying QDA as there are QDA projects.
So as one of the first users, I've been in touch with Chris to figure out ways to improve the system and make it more generally accessible.

One aspect that really needed improvement was visualization.
QC is limited in scope in that it supports assigning codes to relevant lines of an interview transcript, writes those assignments to a database, and enables basic lookups of those relationships.
It does not do visualization, but it does provide users with the tools to do visualization themselves.
In keeps with the spirit of the unix philosophy, which advocates for software to do a handful of things well, while embedding into an ecosystem of related tools to extend from such a basic scope of functionality.

The way this works in practice is that qc allows a user to export all relevant data into json, which can then be picked up in another environment.
I basically developed a system that leverages these json exports to generate a project-specific webpage to support further analysis, beyond the CLI.
