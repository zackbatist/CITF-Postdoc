- Finished hand-coding another interview.
- Scheduled another one, to take place in a few weeks.
- Packaged up qc-viz and refined the readme.

I'll be away the next couple weeks.
I may continue to give and receive updates from team members, but I'll mainly be working on side-projects.
My next post will probably be 2025-W51.
