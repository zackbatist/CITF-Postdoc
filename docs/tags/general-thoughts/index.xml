The meeting was meant to convey my vision for the project to the whole team, to align perspectives, and to articulate how this will actually work in practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The gist is that I will be investigating the role of social and cultural factors in data-sharing initiatives such as CITF and other Maelstrom-affiliated projects, and how these relate to, overlap with, or conflict with technical and institutional/administrative factors. To be clear, these are all very important aspects of data-sharing, but we generally recognized that the social and cultural aspects are under-explored relative to their impact.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
