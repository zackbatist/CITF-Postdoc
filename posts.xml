  <title>Week notes (2025-W18)</title>
  <link>https://zackbatist.info/CITF-Postdoc/posts/weeknotes-2025-W18.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This week I was largely focused on revising the research protcol and submitting an ethics amendment for a slight pivot to the overall project. I also co-hosted a focus group among practicum and thesis students regarding accessing data from the CITF databank. Also made some significant progress on this ICF/data governance paper.</p>
<p>It’s been more relaxed now that the term is over, and some of the more lively personalities in the office are away for various reasons. So it’s been really quiet and calm in general.</p>
<p>Some additional developments in the archaeology realm of my life too, but I do not want to conflate those with this work.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Did my first interview, it went really well! We scheduled a follow-up for next month. I finished transcribing and processing the interview. I also started doing some open / initial coding and memoing.</p>
<p>I made a significant update to the <a href="../qda-protocol.html">QDA protocol</a> and <a href="../data-management.html">data management plan</a>.</p>
<p>I developed another case file and made more concrete progress on planning subsequent interviews. I also obtained informed consent from additional potential participants.</p>
<p>Over the weekend and outside work hours I made significant progress on a revisions to a paper deriving from my thesis. I will be ready to submit the revisions this week.</p>

  <title>Technical specs for this website</title>
  <link>https://zackbatist.info/CITF-Postdoc/posts/tech-specs.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I’m using this website as a way to help organize and share key documents and resources. The research protocols are in flux at this stage in the project’s development, and this will make it easier to distribute up-to-date drafts with partners, while simultaneously enhancing transparency.</p>
<p>This post outlines the technical specifications for this website and outlines a roadmap for its further development. It will therefore be continually updated as the site evolves.</p>
<section id="fundamentals" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h2>
<p>This website is based on <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a>, a platform for writing and publishing scientific and technical writing. I had used quarto before but without fully understanding it, and now I am starting to see its elegance.</p>
<p>I had started off using Hugo, but there were too many limitations that Quarto was able to accomodate. You can find an older version of this post reflecting that setup here: <a href="https://github.com/zackbatist/CITF-Postdoc/commit/2346852df7224ca18eff65c0f34335cc6245a78a">#2346852</a>.</p>
<p>The site is hosted on GitHub Pages. The repo is located at <a href="https://github.com/zackbatist/CITF-Postdoc">https://github.com/zackbatist/CITF-Postdoc</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="generating-pdfs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="generating-pdfs">Generating PDFs</h2>
<p>As an avid user, one thing I really like about Quarto is the ability to generate PDFs alongside html versions served over the web. I started tinkering with includes but I need to review how Quarto passes info from YAML frontmatter. It is not at all straightforward and I will need to experiment a bit more with this to get the hang of it.</p>
</section>
<section id="archiving-and-version-control" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="archiving-and-version-control">Archiving and Version Control</h2>
<p>Every change is tracked using git. I would also like to archive each research protocol in Zenodo once they reach a point of stability. This would ensure that they ca be aassigned DOIs and detailed metadata, which will make them easier to reference.</p>
<p>However, I do not want to rely on Zenodo’s GitHub integration for two reasons: (1) I want this to be as platform-agnostic as possible, and (2) that system relies on GitHub’s release system which operates on the level of the whole repository rather than specific files.</p>
<p>I might be able to write a custom CI workflow to archive specific files to Zenodo using their API. But, I want to be able to toggle this option, rather than have it occur for every single detected change. Maybe I can accomplish this by pushing the changes that I want to archive to a dedicated branch that the CI workflow is configured to operate on. Or it might be easier to simply do this manually, since I’m not sure I will be using it that often anyway.</p>
</section>
<section id="git-submodules" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="git-submodules">Git Submodules</h2>
<p>Since I’m dealing with potentially sensitive information, including recordings, transcripts and notes deriving from interviews that participants may opt to keep confidential, I need to isolate those files so they remain private and secure. To accomplish this, I will set up private git repos on the MCHI-administered GitLab instance and integrate them into my main project repository (hosted on GitHub, and hence less secure) as submodules. I will then configure my quarto rendering options to ignore any subdirectories deemed sensitive enough to not share publicly (which may not include everything in the submodule). I intend to follow <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/git-submodules-private-content/">this guide written by Tania Rascia</a> to pull this off.</p>
<p>Just as a quick reminder of the procedure for committing and syncing changes, based on my testing:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make changes to files in the submodule.</li>
<li>Commit and sync those changes to the remote submodule.</li>
<li>Obtain a record of those changes from the remote submodule:
<ul>
<li><code>git submodule update --remote</code></li>
<li>This can be verified using <code>git status</code>; changes should be indicated as <code>(new commits)</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Commit the record of commits to the main repo’s remote.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="qc" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="qc">qc</h2>
<p>I’m using <a href="https://qualitative-coding.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">qc</a>, a novel qualitative data analysis tool designed for computational thinking. It’s a command line tool that makes QDA compatible with <a href="https://plain-text.co/">textfile based social science workflows</a>, which more-or-less aligns with my overall approach. qc also plays nice with my plan to isolate potentially sensitive information on a private git submodule, and is loosely compatible with my strategy for posting memos and research outputs publicly via this website.</p>
<p>I’m also communicating with its maintainer, Chris Proctor, who is an education researcher and computer scientist based at SUNY Buffalo. This is the perfect combination for this kind of work since he specializes in instilling computational literacies, he has the technical chops to actually develop this system, and most of all: qualitative data analysis is the bread and butter of education research, so he is developing from an informed perspective. I really like what I see so far, and I’m eager to collect data of my own so that I can maximize the full potential that this system affords. I will write another post about my experiences once I have more to report.</p>
<section id="installing-qc" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="installing-qc">Installing qc</h3>
<p>I had a bit of a hard time installing qc using the recommended method (using <code>pipx install qualitative-coding</code>) due to NumPy and spaCy dependency issues, so I had to install from source. First I created a virtual environment:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">python3.12</span> <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">-m</span> venv qc</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span class="bu" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">source</span> qc/bin/activate</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I then downloaded the source code from the <a href="https://github.com/cproctor/qualitative-coding">GitHub repo</a> and installed it within the virtual environment:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">pip</span> install qualitative-coding-main.zip</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then <code>cd</code> into the directory and initialize a qc project:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><span class="bu" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">cd</span> qc</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">qc</span> init</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I applied some custom settings because I’m using Codium instead of VSCode. These basically replace the editor that’s called up when I use the <code>code</code> command.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode yaml code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb4-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

<p>I also set <code>verbose: true</code> to help troubleshoot any issues that might come up and reduce my dependence on Chris.</p>
<p>Regarding the submodule, there is a conflict with how the qc directory had to be generated. I needed to create the qc directory using <code>venv</code>, but I also had to create it by pulling it down from the GitLab server. So I had to create the virtual environment, exit the environment, rename the directory to a placeholder name, pull down the fresh submodule, commit and push the new submodule to the parent git repository, and then copy over all the contents from the placeholder directory into the submodule (and then commit changes and push). Not really a major issue, but a minor incompatibility in the workflow that’s worth noting.</p>

  <title>Week notes (2025-W09)</title>
  <link>https://zackbatist.info/CITF-Postdoc/posts/weeknotes-2025-W09.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This week I continued to work on my methodology notes, specifically going through the coding methods. I also spent some time updating an article from my dissertation that was rejected from a journal again, and I’m trying to see how it can be published elsewhere (including as a preprint on my own website).</p>
<p>I experimented with the mechanism for keeping private data contained in a git submodule stored on a secure server, and fiddled with the quarto configuration too. I updated the <a href="../posts/tech-specs.html">tech specs blog post</a> with some notes.</p>
<p>I also started developing more comprehensive case files, outlining and reflecting on the first case and how I will approach it.</p>
<p>Being a bit ill this week, in combination with the paper rejection and another grant application, made it a bit of a slog. It will be better next week, right?</p>
<p>On the bright side, I started a collaboration with one of Isabel’s former students, trying to revive the momentum on an abandoned paper. We really clicked and I foresee some good work coming out of this in the future, maybe even beyond this one initiaive.</p>

<p>Some highlights from this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>I met with Isabel for our biweekly update. We talked about challenges involved in introducing my work to epidemiologists, and practiced some techniques for communicating what my project is about.</li>
<li>I made some revisions to my ethics protocol in response to the feedback provided by the IRB. Currently trying to resolve a technical problem with the online portal that processes these applications.</li>
<li>I submitted a peer-review.</li>
<li>I followed up on some translation work for SNAP.</li>
<li>I continued with my methodology notes.</li>
</ul>

  <title>Week notes (2025-W07)</title>
  <link>https://zackbatist.info/CITF-Postdoc/posts/weeknotes-2025-W07.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This week I continued my methodological readings. Today I got some requests for minor modifications to my REB protocol, which will be rather painless to implement.</p>
<p>I also attended the Public Health day, a student conference where grad students presented their practicum research. I really enjoyed engaging with the students at the poster session, I actually learned quite a lot.</p>
<p>Next week I’ll try to round off my methodology readings in anticipation of my REB application being approved by the end of this month.</p>

  <title>Week notes (2025-W06)</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This week was a bit slower than usual. The highlight was my meeting with Isabel to go over details about harmonization procedures and to discuss projects that may serve as potential cases. I got a better sense of the community composition and the kinds of challenges that are commonly experienced, and Isabel was able to provide me with contacts to get in touch with once I’m ready to begin collecting data.</p>
<p>I was less active with regards to my methodology notes this week, having spent much time re-organizing and consolidating them. I’m also reading about coding techniques and the foundational principles and debates surrounding grounded theory, but there is a lot of ground to cover and I’m taking it all in before I begin recording my thoughts in a systematic way.</p>
<p>I did some non-postdoc service this week too. I started a peer-review that I had committed to, participated in the monthly <a href="https://sslarch.github.io/">SSLA</a> meeting, and completed the first-pass screening of archaeology-related journals in the <a href="https://doaj.org/">Directory of Open Access Journals</a> to verify their inclusion in <a href="https://diamond.open-archaeo.info/">diamond.open-archaeo</a>.</p>
